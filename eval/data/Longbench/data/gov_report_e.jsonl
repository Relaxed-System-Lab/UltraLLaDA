{"input": "", "context": "The design and development of information systems can be complex undertakings, consisting of a multitude of pieces of equipment and software products, and service providers. Each of the components of an information system may rely on one or more supply chains—that is, the set of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources that create and move a product or service from suppliers to an organization’s customers. Obtaining a full understanding of the sources of a given information system can also be extremely complex. According to the Software Engineering Institute, the identity of each product or service provider may not be visible to others in the supply chain. Typically, an acquirer, such as a federal agency, may only know about the participants to which it is directly connected in the supply chain. Further, the complexity of corporate structures, in which a parent company (or its subsidiaries) may own or control companies that conduct business under different names in multiple countries, presents additional challenges to fully understanding the sources of an information system. As a result, the acquirer may have little visibility into the supply chains of its suppliers. Federal procurement law and policies promote the acquisition of commercial products when they meet the government’s needs. Commercial providers of IT use a global supply chain to design, develop, manufacture, and distribute hardware and software products throughout the world. Consequently, the federal government relies heavily on IT equipment manufactured in foreign nations. Federal information and communications systems can include a multitude of IT equipment, products, and services, each of which may rely on one or more supply chains. These supply chains can be long, complex, and globally distributed and can consist of multiple tiers of outsourcing. As a result, agencies may have little visibility into, understanding of, or control over how the technology that they acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed, as well as the processes, procedures, and practices used to ensure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and services. Table 1 highlights possible manufacturing locations of typical components of a computer or information systems network. Moreover, many of the manufacturing inputs required for these components—whether physical materials or knowledge—are acquired from various sources around the globe. Figure 1 depicts the potential countries of origin of common suppliers of various components in a commercially available laptop computer. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide information security for the information systems and information that support the operations and assets of the agency. The act also requires that agencies ensure that information security is addressed throughout the life cycle of each agency information system. FISMA assigns NIST the responsibility for providing standards and guidelines on information security to agencies. In addition, the act authorizes DHS to develop and issue binding operational directives to agencies, including directives that specify requirements for the mitigation of exigent risks to information systems. NIST has issued several special publications (SP) that provide guidelines to federal agencies on controls and activities relevant to managing supply chain risk. For example, NIST SP 800-39 provides an approach to organization-wide management of information security risk, which states that organizations should monitor risk on an ongoing basis as part of a comprehensive risk management program. NIST SP 800-53 (Revision 4) provides a catalogue of controls from which agencies are to select controls for their information systems. It also specifies several control activities that organizations could use to provide additional supply chain protections, such as conducting due diligence reviews of suppliers and developing acquisition policy, and implementing procedures that help protect against supply chain threats throughout the system development life cycle. NIST SP 800-161 provides guidance to federal agencies on identifying, assessing, selecting, and implementing risk management processes and mitigating controls throughout their organizations to help manage information and communications technology supply chain risks. In addition, as of June 2018, DHS has issued one binding operational directive related to an IT supply chain-related threat. Specifically, in September 2017, DHS issued a directive to all federal executive branch departments and agencies to remove and discontinue present and future use of Kaspersky-branded products on all federal information systems. In consultation with interagency partners, DHS determined that the risks presented by these products justified their removal. Beyond these guidelines and requirements, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 also included provisions related to supply chain security. Specifically, Section 806 authorizes the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to exclude a contractor from specific types of procurements on the basis of a determination of significant supply chain risk to a covered system. Section 806 also establishes requirements for limiting disclosure of the basis of such procurement action. In several reports issued since 2012, we have pointed out that the reliance on complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal information and telecommunications systems. This includes the risk of these systems being manipulated or damaged by leading foreign cyber-threat nations such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Threats and vulnerabilities created by these cyber-threat nations, vendors or suppliers closely linked to cyber-threat nations, and other malicious actors can be sophisticated and difficult to detect and, thus, pose a significant risk to organizations and federal agencies. As we reported in March 2012, supply chain threats are present at various phases of a system’s development life cycle. Key threats that could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies include the following. Installation of hardware or software containing malicious logic, which is hardware, firmware, or software that is intentionally included or inserted in a system for a harmful purpose. Malicious logic can cause significant damage by allowing attackers to take control of entire systems and, thereby, read, modify, or delete sensitive information; disrupt operations; launch attacks against other organizations’ systems; or destroy systems. Installation of counterfeit hardware or software, which is hardware or software containing non-genuine component parts or code. According to the Defense Department’s Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center, counterfeit IT threatens the integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability of information systems for several reasons, including the facts that (1) counterfeits are usually less reliable and, therefore, may fail more often and more quickly than genuine parts; and (2) counterfeiting presents an opportunity for the counterfeiter to insert malicious logic or backdoors into replicas or copies that would be far more difficult in more secure manufacturing facilities. Failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products. Both man-made (e.g., disruptions caused by labor, trade, or political disputes) and natural (e.g., earthquakes, fires, floods, or hurricanes) causes could decrease the availability of material needed to develop systems or disrupt the supply of IT products critical to the operations of federal agencies. Reliance on a malicious or unqualified service provider for the performance of technical services. By virtue of their position, contractors and other service providers may have access to federal data and systems. Service providers could attempt to use their access to obtain sensitive information, commit fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks. Installation of hardware or software that contains unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defects in code that can be exploited. Cyber attackers may focus their efforts on, among other things, finding and exploiting existing defects in software code. Such defects are usually the result of unintentional coding errors or misconfigurations, and can facilitate attempts by attackers to gain unauthorized access to an agency’s information systems and data, or disrupt service. We noted in the March 2012 report that threat actors can introduce these threats into federal information systems by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the global supply chain. In addition, supply chain vulnerabilities can include weaknesses in agency acquisition or security procedures, controls, or implementation related to an information system. Examples of the types of vulnerabilities that could be exploited include acquisitions of IT products or parts from sources other than the original manufacturer or authorized reseller, such as independent distributors, brokers, or on the gray market; lack of adequate testing for software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. If a threat actor exploits an existing vulnerability, it could lead to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system and associated information. This, in turn, can adversely affect an agency’s ability to carry out its mission. In March 2012, we reported that the four national security-related agencies (i.e., Defense, Justice, Energy, and DHS) had acknowledged the risks presented by supply chain vulnerabilities. However, the agencies varied in the extent to which they had addressed these risks by (1) defining supply chain protection measures for department information systems, (2) developing implementing procedures for these measures, and (3) establishing capabilities for monitoring compliance with, and the effectiveness of, such measures. Of the four agencies, the Department of Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. Specifically, the department’s supply chain risk management efforts began in 2003 and included: a policy requiring supply chain risk to be addressed early and across a system’s entire life cycle and calling for an incremental implementation of supply chain risk management through a series of pilot projects; a requirement that every acquisition program submit and update a “program protection plan” that was to, among other things, help manage risks from supply chain exploits or design vulnerabilities; procedures for implementing supply chain protection measures, such as an implementation guide describing 32 specific measures for enhancing supply chain protection and procedures for program protection plans identifying ways in which programs should manage supply chain risk; and a monitoring mechanism to determine the status and effectiveness of supply chain protection pilot projects, as well as monitoring compliance with and effectiveness of program protection policies and procedures for several acquisition programs. Conversely, our report noted that the other three agencies had made limited progress in addressing supply chain risks for their information systems. For example: The Department of Justice had defined specific security measures for protecting against supply chain threats through the use of provisions in vendor contracts and agreements. Officials identified (1) a citizenship and residency requirement and (2) a national security risk questionnaire as two provisions that addressed supply chain risk. However, Justice had not developed procedures for ensuring the effective implementation of these protection measures or a mechanism for verifying compliance with, and the effectiveness of these measures. We stressed that, without such procedures, Justice would have limited assurance that its departmental information systems were being adequately protected against supply chain threats. In May 2011, the Department of Energy revised its information security program, which required Energy components to implement provisions based on NIST and Committee on National Security Systems guidance. However, the department was unable to provide details on implementation progress, milestones for completion, or how supply chain protection measures would be defined. Because it had not defined these measures or associated implementing procedures, we reported that the department was not in a position to monitor compliance or effectiveness. Although its information security guidance mentioned the NIST control related to supply chain protection, DHS had not defined the supply chain protection control activities that system owners should employ. The department’s information security policy manager stated that DHS was in the process of developing policy that would address supply chain protection, but did not provide details on when it would be completed. In the absence of such a policy, DHS was not in a position to develop implementation procedures or to monitor compliance or effectiveness. To assist Justice, Energy, and DHS in better addressing IT supply chain- related security risks for their departmental information systems, we made eight recommendations to these three agencies in our 2012 report. Specifically, we recommended that Energy and DHS: develop and document departmental policy that defines which security measures should be employed to protect against supply chain threats. We also recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS: develop, document, and disseminate procedures to implement the supply chain protection security measures defined in departmental policy, and develop and implement a monitoring capability to verify compliance with, and assess the effectiveness of, supply chain protection measures. The three agencies generally agreed with our recommendations and, subsequently, implemented seven of the eight recommendations. Specifically, we verified that Justice and Energy had implemented each of the recommendations we made to them by 2016. We also confirmed that DHS had implemented two of the three recommendations we made to that agency by 2015. However, as of fiscal year 2016, DHS had not fully implemented our recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to verify compliance with, and assess the effectiveness of, supply chain protections. Although the department had developed a policy and approach for monitoring supply chain risk management activities, it could not provide evidence that its components had actually implemented the policy. Thus, we were not able to close the recommendation as implemented. Nevertheless, the implementation of the seven recommendations and partial implementation of the eighth recommendation better positioned the three agencies to monitor and mitigate their IT supply chain risks. In addition, we reported in March 2012 that the four national security- related agencies had participated in interagency efforts to address supply chain security, including participation in the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, development of technical and policy tools, and collaboration with the intelligence community. In support of the cybersecurity initiative, Defense and DHS jointly led an interagency initiative on supply chain risk management to address issues of globalization affecting the federal government’s IT. Also, DHS had developed a comprehensive portfolio of technical and policy-based product offerings for federal civilian departments and agencies, including technical assessment capabilities, acquisition support, and incident response capabilities. The efforts of the four agencies could benefit all federal agencies in addressing their IT supply chain risks. In summary, the global IT supply chain introduces a myriad of security risks to federal information systems that, if realized, could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists for serious adverse impact on an agency’s operations, assets, and employees. These factors highlight the importance and urgency of federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring IT supply chain risk as part of their agencywide information security programs.

The supply chain—the set of organizations, people, activities, and resources that create and move a product from suppliers to end users—for IT systems is complex and global in scope. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IT supply chain is a continuing threat. Federal security guidelines provide for managing the risks to the supply chain. This testimony statement highlights information security risks associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT systems. The statement also summarizes GAO's 2012 report that assessed the extent to which four national security-related agencies had addressed such risks. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previous reports, as well as information provided by the national security-related agencies on their actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations. GAO also reviewed federal information security guidelines and directives. Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal information systems. Supply chain threats are present during the various phases of an information system's development life cycle and could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies. Information technology (IT) supply chain-related threats are varied and can include: installation of intentionally harmful hardware or software (i.e., containing “malicious logic”); installation of counterfeit hardware or software; failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products; reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers for the performance of technical services; and installation of hardware or software containing unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defective code. These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of materials needed to develop systems. These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include the acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; inadequate testing of software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain. GAO reported in 2012 that the four national security-related agencies in its review—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. Of the four agencies, Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. It had defined and implemented supply chain protection controls, and initiated efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Conversely, Energy and DHS had not developed or documented policies and procedures that defined security measures for protecting against IT supply chain threats and had not developed capabilities for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. Although Justice had defined supply chain protection measures, it also had not developed or documented procedures for implementing or monitoring the measures. Energy and Justice fully implemented the recommendations that GAO made in its 2012 report and resolved the deficiencies that GAO had identified with their supply chain risk management efforts by 2016. DHS also fully implemented two recommendations to document policies and procedures for defining and implementing security measures to protect against supply chain threats by 2015, but could not demonstrate that it had fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to assess the effectiveness of the security measures. In its 2012 report, GAO recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The departments generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation."], "length": 3092, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f91242d1926360ba71923587c1ba63e18d6a3ba749e6fbf6"}
{"input": "", "context": "From 2007 to 2015, HHS, DOL, and DOJ awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. Specifically: HHS identified one grant program subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring for which nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients—the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, which is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Generally, only states are eligible to be primary recipients for PATH grant awards. However, HHS may award PATH grants directly to public or nonprofit entities if a state does not submit an application or does not meet program requirements. From this program, no grants were awarded to nonprofit organizations and therefore no FBOs were awarded grants. DOL identified 18 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring for which nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients. All 18 of these grant programs were in DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA). From these 18 programs, 931 grantees were awarded grants, including 19 we identified as potential FBOs. DOJ identified at least 34 relevant grant programs administered by OVW, COPS, and six different program offices within OJP that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. The 34 relevant grant programs represent the minimum number of grant programs that were subject to nondiscrimination provisions and for which nonprofit organizations were eligible from fiscal years 2007 through 2015. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher. As discussed below, OJP was unable to identify the total number of relevant grant programs and total number grantees awarded grants under these programs, including potential FBOs. More specifically within DOJ: OVW identified 20 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. From these 20 programs, 604 grantees were awarded grants, including 25 that OVW identified as potential FBOs. OJP identified at least 10 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. According to officials, OJP was not able to readily identify grant solicitations that were available to nonprofit organizations from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 and subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This effort, according to OJP, would have required a manual search of each grant solicitation. However, OJP was able to identify at least 10 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious- based hiring. From these 10 programs, at least 1,113 grantees were awarded grants, including 74 we identified as potential FBOs. COPS identified four grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. From these four programs, 57 grantees were awarded grants, none of which were potential FBOs. Of the 117 potential FBOs we identified across the three agencies, nine faith-based grantees, all of which were awarded DOJ grants, certified that they were exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring (see figure 1). These 9 grantees were, therefore, allowed to consider a prospective employee’s religious faith when making employment decisions in connection with the grant. DOL and HHS reported that none of their grantees have sought exemptions from religious-based hiring provisions. As shown in Table 1, 8 of the 9 faith-based grantees that certified that they were exempt were awarded funding through DOJ grant programs from fiscal years 2008 to 2010. The remaining exempted grantee received a funding award in 2015. The total funding awarded to the 9 grantees was approximately $3.2 million, which is less than 1 percent of the $804 million in grants that DOJ awarded that are subject to statutory restrictions from fiscal years 2007 to 2015. DOJ reported that 8 of these grantees received the awards on a noncompetitive basis because they were identified for funding in a DOJ appropriation or accompanying committee report. We interviewed 6 of the 9 grantees that certified that they were exempt from religious-based hiring restrictions. Each of the 6 grantees that we interviewed stated that: hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs to assist with grant activities was critical to their mission and organizational success; they include a “statement of faith” on their organization’s job application form and ask the applicant to attest to the statement of faith, or hired individuals of the same faith already employed within their organization; and had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant or they would have had to seek executive- level approval within their organization to apply for the grant. At least 3 of the 6 grantees stated that they were a recipient of other federal grant funding, but those grants were not subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, and therefore did not require an exemption to make hiring decisions based on religion. Based on grant award documentation, 6 of the 9 grantees used the funding to provide assistance to at-risk youth. However, other services that the remaining grantees provided included first responder training and programs to reduce homelessness, among others, and support and response efforts for victims of sexual assault. As discussed earlier, we also selected 35 potential faith-based grantees that received funding in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and that agencies reported had not filed a self-certification to be exempted from religious- based hiring restrictions. We interviewed 5 of these 35 grantees to discuss, among other things, whether the grantees were familiar with the exemption options. The five faith-based grantees said they did not recall seeing information about the exemption option in the grant application or grant award documentation, or were not looking for information about the exemption because they were not considering religion in their hiring decisions. Two of the faith-based grantees that did not certify as exempt told us that, while they ask that the applicant have an understanding of the traditions, culture, or languages of their religion, they do not require applicants to share the same faith. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions through grant announcements. The agencies also use additional methods that varied across all three agencies for providing this information to grantees. DOJ specifically made this information available on agency web pages as well as in the documentation that is provided to grant recipients. DOJ’s Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has a web page specifically for FBOs that have applied for or received grant funding. This web page includes a list of Frequently Asked Questions, including one that addresses hiring employees with federal grant funds. The Office for Civil Rights within OJP also provides information on its web page regarding how FBOs may certify that they are exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. Additionally, it includes a link to a copy of DOJ’s exemption certification form. We interviewed representatives from four potential faith-based grantees that received a DOJ grant in fiscal years 2014 or 2015 and did not certify for an exemption. All four grantees said they could not recall seeing information in the grant application or award documentation about the exemption option or were not looking for it because they were not considering religion in their hiring decisions. Similarly, DOL has a web page devoted specifically to explaining statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring to faith-based grant applicants and recipients, which also covers the process for seeking exemptions from the restrictions. The web page makes reference to DOL’s regulations related to religious-based hiring by FBOs and also has a link to the June 2007 OLC opinion. Additionally, DOL has prepared a guidance document—available from its grants program overview web page—that explains in detail the process for seeking exemptions and how they are reviewed and approved. A representative from the one potential FBO we interviewed that received a DOL grant in fiscal years 2014 or 2015 but did not certify that they were exempt could not recall seeing information about the exemption option. Lastly, in addition to providing information in grant announcements, HHS provides all SAMHSA grant applicants seeking funds for substance abuse prevention and treatment services with a form that cites laws and regulations governing religious organizations that receive SAMHSA funding, including the regulation that outlines the exemption process. HHS requires the applicants to sign the form, and in doing so, the applicants are certifying that they are aware of and will comply with applicable laws that allow FBOs to provide SAMHSA-funded services without impairing their religious character and without diminishing the religious freedom of those who receive their services. DOJ, DOL, and HHS all require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions. DOJ faith-based grantees that wish to demonstrate they are eligible for an exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring must complete and sign a “Certificate of Exemption for Hiring Practices on the Basis of Religion.” If an applicant is awarded a grant, it must submit a copy of the signed version of this form through DOJ’s Grants Management System. By signing the form, the grantee is certifying that: federally-funded services will be offered to all qualified beneficiaries without regard for the religious or nonreligious beliefs of those individuals; activities that contain inherently religious content will be kept separate from grant-related activities or offered to clients voluntarily; and the organization believes that the services provided are an expression of its religious beliefs, employing persons of a particular religion is important to its mission, and not being able to hire such persons would be a substantial burden to the organization. DOJ does not review these self-certification submissions to approve or deny the requests. It only reviews them for any indication that the applicant may not be an FBO, in which case DOJ officials said they would follow up with the grantee to get clarification. Agency officials also said DOJ would review any self-certifications as part of grantee compliance reviews and in response to complaints from other parties. The self- certification form covers the entire grant award period, and can cover multiple DOJ grants as long as all of the grant programs are subject to the same statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. There is no deadline for submitting the self-certification and DOJ officials told us that while it is understood that self-certifications should be submitted before grant funds are dispersed, grantees do not need to do so. DOL faith-based grantees that wish to demonstrate they are eligible for an exemption also self-certify, but are required to submit their request to DOL for review and approval by the Assistant Secretary responsible for issuing or administering the grant. In its request, the grantee must certify that: providing the services to be funded by the grant is an exercise of its without the grant, its ability to provide the services funded by the grant would be substantially diminished, and providing those services is demonstrably tied to the recipient’s religious beliefs; employing individuals of a particular religious belief is important to its religious identity, autonomy, or communal religious exercise; conditioning the grant award on compliance with the nondiscrimination provision creates substantial pressure on it, in providing the services being funded, to abandon its belief that hiring based on religion is important to its religious exercise; and it will comply with the requirements of 29 C.F.R. part 2, subpart D, Equal Treatment in Department of Labor Programs for Religious Organizations; Protection of Religious Liberty of Department of Labor Social Service Providers and Beneficiaries. The Assistant Secretary’s office then reviews exemption requests and approves them or provides a reason for denial. DOL has instituted a 30- day deadline to reply back to the grant applicant with its decision. DOL implemented this process in response to the 2007 OLC opinion. However, agency officials said they have never used this process because, as explained earlier in this report, DOL has not received any exemption requests. They also told us exemptions are only valid for the grant award period and new requests must be re-submitted if the grant is renewed. However, an exemption can cover multiple grants to the same grantee as long as those grants are received from the same DOL component. Lastly, the officials said that grant funds can be disbursed before the grantee has submitted an exemption request. HHS faith-based grantees seeking to demonstrate that they are eligible for an exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring must self-certify that they meet several requirements outlined in HHS regulations. To demonstrate its eligibility for an exemption, a grantee must certify that: it sincerely believes employing individuals of a particular religion is important to the definition and maintenance of its religious identity, autonomy, and/or communal religious exercise; it makes employment decisions on a religious basis in analogous programs; it believes the grant would materially affect its ability to provide the type of services in question; and providing the services in question is expressive of its values or mission. Grantees must then submit their self-certification to HHS requesting an exemption, and maintain supporting justification documentation on file if needed for future review. However, as explained earlier in this report, there is currently only one HHS grant program that is subject to a statutory restriction on religious-based hiring and for which FBOs are eligible to be primary recipients—the PATH program. We did not identify any faith-based recipients of grants from this program from fiscal years 2007 through 2015, and HHS officials confirmed that no nonprofit entities received any grants from the program during this time. We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Labor, Justice, and Health and Human Services.

In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring. GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption. GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites.

{"input": "", "context": "In our report, we found that, according to data from CBP’s Seized Asset and Case Tracking System (SEACATS), during fiscal years 2012 through 2016 CBP conducted about 308,000 seizures of inbound international items that may pose a threat to U.S. security, health and safety, business, and ecology. Of those, CBP seized about 70 percent from mail and 30 percent from express cargo. Seized items are categorized in SEACATS as either drugs or merchandise. Among the approximately 308,000 seizures, illegal or inadmissible drugs accounted for about 47 percent of total seizures and merchandise accounted for about 53 percent. According to testimony by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, a recent increase in deaths related to the synthetic opioid fentanyl has resulted in an increased focus on identifying methods by which traffickers bring fentanyl into the United States. In fiscal years 2012 through 2015, CBP’s seizure data reflect zero seizures of fentanyl, but according to CBP, fentanyl seizures would have been captured under other categories in SEACATS. According to CBP, a specific category code for fentanyl was added to SEACATS in fiscal year 2016. SEACATS reflects 53 seizures of fentanyl in fiscal year 2016 via both mail and express cargo. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both USPS and express consignment operators provide items to CBP for inspection. Express consignment operators accept items for delivery to the United States at points of sale in foreign countries and provide EAD to CBP prior to the items’ scheduled arrival in the United States. CBP then analyzes the EAD and provides lists of targeted items to express consignment operators. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with EAD for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement. According to USPS data, USPS received EAD for about one third of all inbound international mail (excluding letters, flats, and military/diplomatic mail) for the period from April 2016 through March 2017. For the month of March 2017 (the most recent data available at the time of our review), USPS data indicate that EAD was available for roughly half of all inbound international mail (excluding letters, flats, and military/diplomatic mail). In 2014 and 2015, USPS and CBP initiated two pilot programs at the New York International Service Center (ISC) to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. At the time of our review, CBP did not use EAD to target mail for inspection outside of these pilots. According to USPS documents, the goal of these pilots is to test the effectiveness of placing holds on mail that has been targeted by CBP based on EAD. Under the pilots, CBP uses EAD to target a small number of pieces of mail each day. According to USPS officials, when USPS employees scan either individual targeted pieces or larger sacks containing this targeted mail, they are alerted that CBP has targeted the item and set the item or sack aside for inspection. Since the pilots began, USPS has made efforts to locate and provide CBP with the targeted mail and CBP has collected performance data on the percentage of targeted mail USPS has provided for inspection: about 82 percent for one pilot, and about 58 percent for the other. In our report we note that, according to USPS and CBP, USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection because locating targeted mail once it arrives at an ISC has been a challenge. Specifically, USPS ISCs may receive thousands of large sacks of mail per day that are scanned as they are accepted. Each sack may contain hundreds of pieces of mail that are not individually scanned upon arrival. As a result, locating a targeted item requires manually sorting through the entire sack, and USPS employees may overlook the item while sorting through the larger sack to locate targeted mail. According to USPS officials, at the time of our review they were testing an automated method to identify targeted mail within these larger sacks. Standards for internal control in the federal government state that defining program goals in specific and measurable terms allows for the assessment of performance toward achieving objectives. However, while USPS and CBP have collected some performance information for these pilots (including the percentage of targeted mail provided for inspection), this information is not linked to a specific performance target agreed upon by USPS and CBP—such as a specific percentage of targeted mail provided to CBP for inspection. Further, the agencies have not conducted an analysis to determine if the pilot programs are achieving desired outcomes. In our report, we concluded that, because CBP and USPS lack clear performance goals for these pilots, they risk spending additional time and resources expanding them prior to fully assessing the pilots’ success or failure. As such, we recommended that CBP, in conjunction with USPS, (1) establish measureable performance goals for pilot programs and (2) assess the performance of the pilots in achieving these goals. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with this recommendation and plans to implement it by February 28, 2018. In our report we found that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing the volume of inspected mail and increasing the percentage of inspections that result in identification of a threatening or illegal item. This potential outcome could decrease time and resources needed for the screening process—potentially decreasing costs—and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. Specifically, regarding the costs of collecting EAD, USPS has not calculated the current costs of collecting EAD from countries with which it has data-sharing agreements, but officials stated that USPS does not incur significant additional costs for each new designated postal operator or type of mail for which it begins collecting EAD. While some of the costs of obtaining EAD may be borne by designated postal operators in other countries, rather than directly by USPS, costs to USPS to use EAD to target mail for inspection may include: equipment and personnel required to identify targeted mail (such as equipment required to sort through hundreds of pieces of mail to identify a single piece of mail), and software upgrades required to exchange data with foreign postal operators and with CBP. In our report we found that an analysis of the costs associated with planned efforts is particularly critical given USPS’s financial challenges. As we recently found, USPS reported a net loss of $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2016—its 10th consecutive year of net losses. In light of this situation, any expenditure of financial resources to make any additional infrastructure and information technology upgrades necessary to implement the use of EAD for targeting merit careful consideration. Beyond costs, in our report we also determined that USPS and CBP have not performed an analysis of the benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection, including the effectiveness of targeted inspection based on EAD relative to other methods of selecting mail for inspection. Thus, the extent to which targeting based on EAD might result in an increased ability to identify threats or other benefits over current methods is unknown. For example, CBP has collected data on the percentage of inspections resulting in a seizure for mail inspected as a result of targeting in the pilot programs at the New York ISC. However, CBP does not collect comparable data for seizures resulting from inspections conducted based on current methods of choosing mail for inspection. Moreover, USPS and CBP experience challenges related to inspecting mail that may limit their ability to effectively use EAD to target mail for screening and, thus, to experience EAD’s possible benefits. For example, USPS depends on foreign postal operators to make EAD available. According to USPS and State Department officials, however, those operators may not share the same security priorities as USPS and CBP and may not make EAD available. If the amount of available EAD remains limited for inbound mail, this may reduce the effectiveness of CBP’s targeting efforts or could constrain CBP’s ability to reduce the volume of mail it inspects. Our prior work has found that in designing preventive measures—such as the screening of inbound mail to identify potential threats—it is helpful to conduct a thorough assessment of vulnerabilities as well as cost-benefit analyses of alternative strategies. In the absence of information on the relative costs of various methods of selecting mail for inspection as well as their effectiveness at identifying potential threats in inbound mail, USPS and CBP are unable to fully understand whether obtaining additional EAD for targeting purposes will provide security or resource benefits. In our report, we therefore concluded that, particularly in light of the challenges that collecting and using these data present, it is important that CBP and USPS carefully consider actions to enhance inbound international mail security to avoid wasting time and money on potentially ineffective and costly endeavors. As such, we recommended that CBP, in conjunction with USPS, evaluate the relative costs and benefits of collecting EAD for targeting mail for inspection in comparison to other methods. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with this recommendation and plans to implement it by February 28, 2018. In conclusion, existing pilots could be used as an opportunity for CBP and USPS to: (1) articulate performance goals for the pilots, (2) collect data and assess the pilots on their success in enabling USPS to provide targeted mail to CBP for inspection, and (3) assess the costs and benefits of various methods of choosing mail for inspection. We are encouraged that USPS and the Department of Homeland Security agreed with our findings and recommendations. Effective implementation of our recommendations should help CBP and USPS ensure that efforts to collect and use EAD to target mail for inspection achieve the desired security and resource benefits.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary federal agency tasked with targeting and inspecting inbound international items and seizing illegal goods, including illegal or inadmissible drugs and merchandise. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and express consignment operators (such as FedEx and DHL) provide items to CBP for inspection. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with electronic advance data (EAD), such as the shipper's and recipient's name and address, for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement.

{"input": "", "context": "This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler shipbuilding program, a program to build a new class of 20 fleet oilers for the Navy. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program. Issues for Congress regarding the TAO-205 program include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the program; the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations; and whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy. Decisions that Congress makes regarding the program could affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the TAO-205 program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke. The primary role of Navy fleet oilers is to transfer fuel to Navy surface ships that are operating at sea, so as to extend the operating endurance of these surface ships and their embarked aircraft. Fleet oilers also provide other surface ships with lubricants, fresh water, and small amounts of dry cargo. Fleet oilers transfer fuel and other supplies to other surface ships in operations called underway replenishments (UNREPs). During an UNREP, an oiler steams next to the receiving ship and transfers fuel by hose (see Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 ). Oilers are one kind of Navy UNREP ship; other Navy UNREP ships include ammunition ships, dry cargo ships, and multiproduct replenishment ships. The Navy's UNREP ships are known more formally as the Navy's combat logistics force (CLF). Most of the Navy's CLF ships are operated by the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Navy oilers carry the designation TAO (sometimes written as T-AO). The T means that the ships are operated by MSC with a mostly civilian crew; the A means it is an auxiliary ship of some kind; and the O means that it is, specifically, an oiler. Although the role of fleet oilers might not be considered as glamorous as that of other Navy ships, fleet oilers are critical to the Navy's ability to operate in forward-deployed areas around the world on a sustained basis. The U.S. Navy's ability to perform UNREP operations in a safe and efficient manner on a routine basis is a skill that many other navies lack. An absence of fleet oilers would significantly complicate the Navy's ability to operate at sea on a sustained basis in areas such as the Western Pacific or the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf region. The Navy states that the ability to rearm, refuel and re-provision our ships at sea, independent of any restrictions placed on it by a foreign country, is critical to the Navy's ability to project warfighting power from the sea. As the lifeline of resupply to Navy operating forces underway, the ships of the Navy's Combat Logistic Force (CLF) enable Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups to operate forward and remain on station during peacetime and war, with minimal reliance on host nation support. The Navy's existing force of fleet oilers consists of 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class ships ( Figure 4 ). These ships were procured between FY1982 and FY1989 and entered service between 1986 and 1996. They have an expected service life of 35 years; the first ship in the class will reach that age in 2021. The ships are about 677 feet long and have a full load displacement of about 41,000 tons, including about 26,500 tons of fuel and other cargo. The ships were built by Avondale Shipyards of New Orleans, LA, a shipyard that eventually became part of the shipbuilding firm Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII). HII subsequently wound down Navy shipbuilding operations at Avondale, and the facility no longer builds ships. (HII continues to operate two other shipyards that build Navy ships.) The TAO-205 class program was originally called the TAO(X) program, with the (X) meaning that the exact design of the ship had not yet been determined. On January 6, 2015, then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that ships in the class will be named for \"people who fought for civil rights and human rights,\" and that the first ship in the class, TAO-205, which was procured in FY2016, will be named for Representative John Lewis. The class consequently is now known as the John Lewis (TAO-205) class. As part of its goal for achieving a fleet of 355 ships, the Navy wants to procure a total of 20 TAO-205 class ships. The required number of oilers largely depends on the numbers and types of other surface ships (and their embarked aircraft) to be refueled, and the projected operational patterns for these ships and aircraft. The first TAO-205 class ship was procured in FY2016, the second in FY2018, and the third and fourth in FY2019. The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2023) shipbuilding plan calls for procuring the next seven ships in the class in annual quantities of 2-1-1-2-1. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan calls for procuring the remaining nine ships in the program at a rate of one per year starting in FY2025. The first TAO-205 is scheduled for delivery in November 2020. Table 1 shows procurement funding for the TAO-205 program in the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the total procurement cost of the 20 planned TAO-205s at $12,196.1 million (i.e., about 12.2 billion) in then-year dollars, or an average of $609.8 million each. Since the figure of $12,196.1 million is in then-year dollars, it incorporates estimated annual inflation rates for TAO-205s to be procured out to FY2033. The TAO-205 class design ( Figure 5 ) will have capabilities similar to those of the Kaiser-class ships, and will rely on existing technologies rather than new technologies. To guard against oil spills, TAO-205s are to be double-hulled, like modern commercial oil tankers, with a space between the two hulls to protect the inner hull against events that puncture the outer hull. (The final Kaiser-class ships are double-hulled, but earlier ships in the class are single-hulled.) TAO-205s are being built by General Dynamics/National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (GD/NASSCO) of San Diego, CA, a shipyard that builds Navy auxiliaries and DOD sealift ships. On June 25, 2015, the Navy, as part of its acquisition strategy for TAO-205 program, issued a combined solicitation consisting of separate Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for the detailed design and construction (DD&C) of the first six TAO-205s; the DD&C in FY2017 (and also procurement of long lead-time materials in FY2016) for an amphibious assault ship called LHA-8 that the Navy procured in FY2017; and contract design support for the LPD-17 Flight II program (previously called the LX[R] program), a program to procure a new class of 13 amphibious ships. The Navy limited bidding in this combined solicitation to two bidders—Ingalls Shipbuilding of Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII/Ingalls) and GD/NASSCO—on the grounds that these are the only two shipbuilders that have the capability to build both TAO-205s and LHA-8. Under the Navy's plan for the combined solicitation, one of these two yards was to be awarded the DD&C contract for the first six TAO-205s, the other yard was to be awarded the DD&C contract (and procurement of long lead-time materials) for LHA-8, and the shipyard with the lowest combined evaluated price was to receive a higher profit on its DD&C contract and was to be awarded the majority of the LPD-17 Flight II contract design engineering man-hours. On June 30, 2016, the Navy announced its awards in the above-described combined solicitation, awarding a fixed price incentive block buy contract for the DD&C of the first six TAO-205s to GD/NASSCO. (The Navy awarded the contract for the DD&C of LHA-8 to HII/Ingalls. HII/Ingalls was also awarded the majority of the LPD-17 Flight II contract design engineering man-hours.) The Navy was granted authority for using a block buy contract to procure the first six TAO-205s by Section 127 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act ( S. 1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015). It was earlier estimated that the block buy contract would reduce the procurement cost of the second through sixth TAO-205s by an average of about $45 million each, compared to costs under the standard or default DOD approach of annual contracting. The Navy states that about $35 million of the $45 million in per-ship savings will come from using advance procurement (AP) funding for batch-ordering TAO-205 components. The Navy states that this use of AP funding could have occurred under annual contracting, and that the savings that are intrinsic to the block buy contract are thus about $10 million per ship. Section 8117 of the FY2019 Appropriations Act (Division A of H.R. 6157 / P.L. 115-245 of September 28, 2018) states the following: Sec. 8117. None of the funds provided in this Act for the TAO Fleet Oiler program shall be used to award a new contract that provides for the acquisition of the following components unless those components are manufactured in the United States: Auxiliary equipment (including pumps) for shipboard services; propulsion equipment (including engines, reduction gears, and propellers); shipboard cranes; and spreaders for shipboard cranes. The Appendix presents the Government Accountability Office's (GAO's) assessment of the TAO-205 class program from GAO's annual report surveying DOD major acquisition programs. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the 5th and 6th ships in the program. The Navy estimates the combined procurement cost of the two ships at $1,056.3 million, or an average of $528.1 million each. The two ships have received $75.0 million in prior-year advance procurement (AP) funding, and the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the remaining $981.2 million in procurement funding needed to complete the two ships' estimated combined procurement cost. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget also requests $73.0 million in AP funding for TAO-205s to be procured in future fiscal years, and $3.7 million in cost-to-complete procurement funding to cover cost growth on TAO-205s procured in prior fiscal years, bringing the total FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program (aside from outfitting and post-delivery costs) to $1,057.9 million. One issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program. In assessing this issue, Congress may consider, among other things, whether the Navy has accurately priced the work that it is requesting to fund in FY2020. Another issue for Congress concerns the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations. The Navy is implementing a new operational concept, called Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), that could lead to the development of a fleet with larger numbers of individually smaller ships, and to more-widely dispersed Navy operations. DMO could affect requirements for Navy logistics, including oilers. The Navy states that Recapitalizing the auxiliary and sealift fleet in support of DMO has become a top priority. The initial reviews of the requirements to support this operational maritime concept indicate potential growth across the five lines of effort: refuel, rearm, resupply, repair, and revive. Coincident is the review of the level of effort needed to distribute logistics into a contested maritime environment following safe transfer by the logistics fleet—smaller, faster, multi-mission transports likely resident within the future battle force. The work to fully flesh out the requirement is ongoing, but the aggregate is expected to be no less than the current requirement, reinforcing the urgency to recapitalize the current fleet. An August 2017 GAO report states the following: The readiness of the surge sealift and combat logistics fleets has trended downward since 2012. For example, GAO found that mission-limiting equipment casualties—incidents of degraded or out-of-service equipment—have increased over the past 5 years, and maintenance periods are running longer than planned, indicating declining materiel readiness across both fleets.... The Navy has not assessed the effects of widely distributed operations, which could affect the required number and type of combat logistics ships. The Navy released its new operational concept of more widely distributed operations—ships traveling farther distances and operating more days to support a more distributed fleet—in 2017. The Navy has not assessed the effects that implementing this concept will have on the required number and type of combat logistics ships. These effects could be exacerbated in the event that the Navy is less able to rely on in-port refueling—which has comprised about 30 percent of all refuelings over the past 3 years—placing greater demand on the combat logistics fleet. Given the fleet's dependence on the combat logistics force, waiting until 2019 or 2020 to conduct an assessment, as planned, could result in poor investment decisions as the Navy continues to build and modernize its fleet. Furthermore, without assessing the effects of widely distributed operations on logistics force requirements and modifying its force structure plans accordingly, the Navy risks being unprepared to provide required fuel and other supplies. Another issue for Congress is whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy. The issue relates to how changes in the international security environment might affect how the Navy operates and equips its underway replenishment ships. During the Cold War, the Navy procured underway replenishment ships to support a two-stage approach to underway replenishment in which single-product \"shuttle\" ships (such as oilers, ammunition ships, and dry stores ships) would take their supplies from secure ports to relatively safe midocean areas, where they would then transfer them to multiproduct \"station\" ships called TAOEs and AORs. The TAOEs and AORs would then travel to Navy carrier strike groups operating in higher-threat areas and transfer their combined supplies to the carrier strike group ships. As a result, single-product shuttle ships were equipped with lesser amounts of ship self-defense equipment, and TAOEs and AORs were equipped with greater amounts of such equipment. When the Cold War ended and transitioned to the post-Cold War era, threats to U.S. Navy ships operating at sea were substantially reduced. As a consequence, the amount of ship self-defense equipment on the TAOEs and AORs was reduced, and a single-stage approach to underway replenishment, in which oilers and dry stores ships took supplies from secure ports all the way to carrier strike group ships, was sometimes used. Now that the post-Cold War era has transitioned to a new strategic environment featuring renewed great power competition with countries like China and Russia, and a consequent renewal of potential threats to U.S. Navy ships operating at sea, the question is whether TAO-205s should be equipped with lesser amounts of ship self-defense equipment, like oilers were during both the Cold War and post-Cold War eras, or with greater amounts of ship self-defense equipment, like TAOEs and AORs were during the Cold War. Building TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy could increase TAO-205 procurement costs by tens of millions of dollars per ship, depending on the amount of additional ship self-defense equipment. Section 1026 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act ( S. 1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015) required an independent assessment of the Navy's combat logistics force ships. The report was delivered to Congress in February 2016. A copy of the report was posted by the media outlet Politico on March 11, 2016. The report states the following: The T-AO(X) will only have a limited capability to defeat a submarine launched torpedo attack and no capability to defeat a missile attack. When delivered, the TAO(X) will have: —[the] NIXIE Torpedo Countermeasure System [for decoying certain types of torpedoes] —[the] Advanced Degaussing System (Anti-Mine) [for reducing the ship's magnetic signature, so as to reduce the likelihood of attack by magnetically fused mines] When required, the T-AO(X) will also have ability to embark Navy Expeditionary Combat Command Expeditionary Security Teams (EST). The ESTs will embark with several crew served weapons and are designed to provide limited self-defense against a small boat attack. The T-AO(X) will have Space, Weight, Power and Cooling (SWAP-C) margins for future installations of the following systems: —[the] Close In Weapon System (CIWS) or SeaRAM (Rolling Airframe Missile) [for defense against missile attack] —[the] Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System (ATTDS) [for destroying torpedoes] Even after the installation of a CIWS or ATTDS, if the T-AO(X) was to operate in anything other than a benign environment, the ship will require both air and surface escorts. The decision to rely on [other] Fleet assets to provide force protection [i.e., defense against attacks] for the T-AO(X) was validated by the JROC [in June 2015]. Table 2 summarizes congressional action on the Navy's request for FY2020 procurement funding for the TAO-205 program. A May 2019 GAO report—the 2019 edition of GAO's annual report surveying DOD major acquisition programs—stated the following regarding the TAO-205 program: Technology Maturity and Design Stability The Navy has matured all Lewis class critical technologies and stabilized the ships' design. In 2014, the Navy identified three critical technologies for the Lewis class, all of which involved a new system for transferring cargo at sea. Prior to initiating detail design activities in June 2016, the Navy completed prototype tests of the critical technologies and found that they were fully mature—an approach consistent with shipbuilding best practices. In 2017, the Navy removed one critical technology—the Heavy e-STREAM cargo delivery system—from the Lewis class design. The Navy had intended to use this system to deliver F-35 Lightning II power modules. The Navy subsequently decided to deliver these by air, which precluded any need for the Heavy system. Lead ship construction began in September 2018 with 95 percent of the ship's total design effort complete. Program officials stated that this figure meant that 100 percent of the ship's basic and functional design were by then complete—an approach consistent with best practices. Throughout detail design and now into construction, the Navy has not changed the Lewis class program's performance requirements. The Navy also leveraged commercial vessel designs to minimize design and construction risks. The Lewis class features a modern double-hull construction, an environmental-based design standard for commercial tankers, to ensure the ships can dock at ports-of-call. This design was included in the final three Kaiser class oilers. Production Readiness The program office has largely kept to its construction schedule to date for the first ship, but a flooding incident at a NASSCO graving dock in July 2018 has affected the delivery of future ships. The program office stated that this incident has not affected current ship fabrication activities. However, the dock's unavailability while repairs are planned and implemented has disrupted the contractor's schedule for future ships. According to the program office, the incident has resulted in some delays to certain delivery dates for ships two through six. Other Program Issues As part of the Navy's plan to expand the fleet, the Navy concluded that it would need an additional three Lewis class ships. The Navy's budget request for fiscal year 2019 increased its planned one-ship-per-year buy to two for fiscal years 2019, 2021, and 2023. The Congress provided appropriations for the additional fiscal year 2019 ship in support of the Navy's request. To account for the additional ships in fiscal years 2019 and 2021, the Navy plans to add two more ships to the low-rate initial production phase. Subsequently, program officials stated that they plan to compete a new contract for the remaining 12 ships using the construction knowledge gained from efforts under the existing contract. Program Office Comments We provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and comment. The program office provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. The program office stated that it continues to follow GAO shipbuilding best practices and has leveraged commercial vessel design practices to minimize risk. The program office also stated that it is currently revising its acquisition baseline to reflect the update in total quantities to 20 ships. In addition, the program office noted that, in fiscal year 2019, it fully funded the third and fourth ships and funded advance procurement for the fifth ship.", "answers": ["The Navy began procuring John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers in FY2016, and a total of four have been procured through FY2019, including two in FY2019. The first six ships are being procured under a block buy contract that was authorized by Section 127 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 1356/P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015). The Navy wants to procure a total of 20 TAO-205s. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program. The Navy estimates the combined procurement cost of the two ships at $1,056.3 million, or an average of $528.1 million each. The two ships have received $75.0 million in prior-year advance procurement (AP) funding, and the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the remaining $981.2 million in procurement funding needed to complete the two ships' estimated combined procurement cost. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget also requests $73.0 million in AP funding for TAO-205s to be procured in future fiscal years, and $3.7 million in cost-to-complete procurement funding to cover cost growth on TAO-205s procured in prior fiscal years, bringing the total FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program (aside from outfitting and post-delivery costs) to $1,057.9 million. Issues for Congress include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program; the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations; and whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy."], "length": 3632, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "54da2503ef9cd61e98fc39ba742772c8a15311d72ab94a08"}
{"input": "", "context": "Unemployment Compensation (UC) is a joint federal-state program financed by federal payroll taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). These revenues are deposited into the appropriate account within the federal Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). Originally, the intent of the UC program, among other goals, was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions. This intent is reflected in the current UC program's funding and benefit structure. When the economy grows, UC program revenue rises through increased tax revenues. At the same time, UC program spending falls because fewer workers are unemployed. The effect of collecting more taxes while decreasing spending on benefits dampens demand in the economy. It also creates a surplus of funds, or a reserve fund , for the UC program to draw upon during a recession. These reserve balances are credited in the state's account within the UTF. During an economic slowdown or recession, UC tax revenue falls and UC program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits. The increased amount of UC payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of lost earnings by injecting additional funds into the economy. States levy their own payroll taxes (SUTA) on employers to fund regular UC benefits and the state share (50%) of the Extended Benefit (EB) program. Federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines for these state taxes. Each state deposits its SUTA revenue into its account within the UTF. SUTA revenue finances UC benefits. Generally, when economic activity is robust and increasing, SUTA revenue is greater than a state's UC expenditures. As a result, the state's reserves within the UTF grow. This trend is reversed during economic recessions and during the early economic recovery period, when the state's reserves are drawn down and new SUTA revenue does not always make up the shortfall. If the recession is deep enough and if SUTA revenue is inadequate for long periods of time, states may have insufficient funds to pay for UC benefits. Federal law, which requires states to pay these benefits, provides a loan mechanism within the UTF framework that an insolvent state may opt to use to meet its UC benefit payment obligations. States must pay back these loans. If the loans are not paid back quickly (depending on the timing of the beginning of the loan period), states may face interest charges and the states' employers may face increased net FUTA rates until the loans are repaid. In the years immediately following the most recent recession, many states had insufficient SUTA revenue and UTF account balances to pay UC benefits. All FUTA revenue is deposited into the Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) within the UTF. Federal unemployment taxes pay for the federal share of EB (50%) and for administrative grants to the states. Additionally, through the federal loan account within the UTF, FUTA funds may be loaned to insolvent states to assist the payment of the states' UC obligations. FUTA imposes a 6.0% gross federal unemployment tax rate on the first $7,000 paid annually by employers to each employee. Employers in states with programs approved by the U.S. Labor Secretary and with no outstanding federal loans may credit up to 5.4 percentage points of state unemployment taxes paid against the 6.0% tax rate, making the minimum net federal unemployment tax rate 0.6%. Because most employees earn more than the $7,000 taxable wage ceiling in a calendar year, the FUTA tax typically is $42 per worker per year ($7,000 × 0.6%), or just over 2 cents per hour for a full-time, year-round worker. States have a great deal of autonomy in how they establish and run their unemployment insurance programs. However, the framework established by federal laws is clear and requires states to promptly pay the UC benefits as provided under state law. In budgetary terms, UC benefits are an entitlement (although the program is financed by a dedicated tax imposed on employers and not by general revenue). Thus, even if a recession hits a given state and, as a result, that state's trust fund account is depleted, the state remains legally required to continue paying benefits. To do so, the state might borrow money either from the dedicated loan account within the UTF or from outside sources. If the state chooses to borrow funds from the UTF, not only will the state be required to continue paying benefits, it also will be required to repay the funds (plus any interest due) it has borrowed from the federal loan account within a few years. Such states may need to raise taxes on their employers or reduce UC benefit levels, actions that dampen economic growth, job creation, and consumer demand. In short, states have strong incentives to keep adequate funds in their trust fund accounts. If the state borrows from sources outside the UTF, the state would not be subject to the loan restrictions described below. Instead, the state would be subject to the terms within that outside loan agreement, which might offer a different (more favorable) interest rate or repayment schedule but may include fees to establish the loan. The Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) is the federal loan account within the UTF. The FUA is primarily funded from the statutory transfer of excess revenue from the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA) being deposited into the FUA. If needed, the FUA may borrow funds from other federal accounts within the UTF or from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. From FY2009 to FY2015, the FUA had to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury to finance loans to the state accounts. 1. Revenue from additional FUTA taxes paid by employers when a reduced credit against federal unemployment taxes exists because the state has an outstanding unpaid loan from FUA is deposited into the FUA. (See the discussion below on \" Federal Tax Increases on Outstanding Loans Through Credit Reductions \" for a more detailed explanation of these additional taxes.) 2. Federal law allows the FUA to borrow available funds from the other federal (EUCA and ESAA) accounts within the UTF. 3. Federal law also authorizes appropriations as loans from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury if balances in the federal accounts are insufficient to cover their expenditures. (For example, if the states' borrowing needs exceed the available FUA balance.) Such appropriations require discretionary action by Congress and the President. Once a state recognizes that it does not have sufficient funds to pay UC benefits, the mechanism for receiving a loan from the UTF is straightforward. The state's governor (or the governor's designee) must submit a letter requesting that the U.S. Labor Secretary advance funds to the state account within the UTF. Once the loan is approved by the U.S. Labor Secretary, the funds are placed into the state account in monthly increments. States with outstanding loans from the UTF must repay them fully by the November 10 following the second consecutive January 1 on which the state has an outstanding loan. If the outstanding loan is not repaid by that time, the state will face an effective federal tax increase. Thus, a state may have approximately 22 months (if borrowing began on January 1) to 34 months (if borrowing began on January 2) to repay the loan without a federal tax increase, depending on when it obtained the outstanding loan. As of January 29, 2019, approximately $68.3 million in federal UTF loans to the states were outstanding. A current list of states with outstanding loans may be found at the Department of Labor's (DOL's) website, https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/budget.asp . If the state does not repay a loan by November 10 of the second year, the state becomes subject to a reduction in the amount of state unemployment tax credit applied against the federal unemployment tax beginning with the preceding January 1 until the state repays the loan fully. Depending on the duration of the loan and certain other measures, one or more of three different credit reductions may be required. These reductions are fully catalogued in Table 1 . At the height of the period following the most recent recession (2011), 20 states and the Virgin Islands faced increased FUTA rates because of outstanding UTF loans. The credit reduction is initially a 0.3 percentage point reduction for the year beginning with the calendar year in which the second consecutive January 1 passes during which the loan is outstanding and increases by a 0.3 percentage point reduction for each year there is an outstanding loan. For example, in the first year, the credit reduction results in the net federal tax rate increasing from 0.6% to 0.9%—an additional $21 for each employee; in the second year, it would increase to 1.2%—a cumulative additional $42 for each employee. Two potential other credit reductions exist (in addition to the cumulative 0.3 percentage point increases) during the ensuing calendar years in which a state has an outstanding loan: 1. Beginning in the third year, the 2.7 add-on uses a statutory formula that takes into consideration the average annual wages and average employment contribution rate. 2. Beginning in the fifth year, the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) add-on replaces the 2.7 add-on and uses the five-year benefit-cost rate as well as average wages in its calculation. Table 1 presents these reductions and the subsequent net FUTA tax faced by state employers as a result of these unpaid loans. If any January 1 passes without an outstanding balance, the year count starts over with the next loan. DOL maintains a list of potential reduced credit states at http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/docs/reduced_credit_states.xlsx . Section 272 of P.L. 97-248 allows a delinquent state the option of repaying—on or before November 9—a portion of its outstanding loans each year through transfer of a specified amount from its account in the UTF to the FUA. If the state complies with all the requirements listed below, the potential credit reduction is avoided (there is no reduction): The state must repay all loans for the most recent one-year period ending on November 9, plus the potential additional taxes that would have been imposed for the tax year based upon a state tax credit reduction. The state must have sufficient amounts in the state account of the UTF to pay all compensation for the last quarter of that calendar year without receiving a loan. The state also must have altered its state law to increase the net solvency of its account with the UTF. From 2011 through 2014, South Carolina met these requirements. As a result, employers in South Carolina were not subject to a state tax credit reduction in the calculation of their FUTA taxes. (Generally, employers in South Carolina would have paid more in state unemployment taxes to meet these requirements.) Once a state begins to have a credit reduction, the state may apply to have the reductions capped if the state meets four criteria: No legislative or other action in 12 months ending September 30 has been taken to decrease the state's unemployment tax effort. (A state cannot actively decrease its expected state unemployment tax revenue from current law.) No legislative or other action has been taken to decrease the net solvency of the state's trust fund account. (For example, the state would not be allowed to actively increase the average UC benefit amount from current law requirements.) Average state unemployment tax rate on total wages must exceed the five-year average benefit-cost rate on total wages. Balance of outstanding loans as of September 30 must not be greater than the balance three years before. The BCR add-on may be waived if the Secretary of Labor determines the state did not take legislative or other actions to decrease the net solvency of the state's trust fund account. The 2.7 add-on would then replace the BCR add-on. The additional federal taxes attributable to the credit reduction are applied against the state's outstanding UTF loan. Thus, although technically employers are paying additional FUTA taxes, the additional tax pays off a state's debt. The state's employers will pay the additional federal taxes resulting from the credit reduction no later than January 31 of the next calendar year. Since April 1, 1982 ( P.L. 97-35 as amended), states have been charged interest on new loans that are not repaid by the end of the fiscal year in which they were obtained. (Before April 1, 1982, states could receive these loans interest free.) The interest is the same rate as that paid by the federal government on state reserves in the UTF for the quarter ending December 31 of the preceding year but not higher than 10% per annum. The interest rate for calendar year loans is determined by Section 1202(b)(4) of the Social Security Act. The interest rate for a calendar year is the earnings yield on the UTF for the quarter ending December 31 of the previous calendar year. The U.S. Treasury Department calculated the fourth-quarter earnings yield in 2018 to be 2.3081%. Thus, loans made in calendar year 2019 are subject to an interest rate of 2.3081%. States may not pay the interest directly or indirectly from SUTA revenue or funds in their state account within the UTF. If a state does not repay the interest, or if it pays the interest with funds from SUTA taxes, DOL is required by federal law to refuse to certify that state's program as being in compliance with federal law. Not being in compliance with federal unemployment law would mean that the state would not be eligible to receive administrative grants and employers in that state would not receive the state unemployment tax credit in the calculation of their federal unemployment taxes. States may borrow funds without interest from the UTF during the year. To receive these interest-free loans, the states must meet five conditions: 1. The states must repay the loans by September 30. 2. For those repaid (by September 30) loans to maintain their interest-free status, there cannot be any loans made to that state in October, November, or December of the calendar year of such an interest-free loan. If loans are made in the last quarter of the calendar year, the \"interest-free\" loans made in the previous fiscal year will retroactively accrue interest charges. 3. The states must meet funding goals relating to their account in the UTF, established under regulations issued by DOL. In addition to these first three requirements, the phase-in of two new requirements began in 2014. The full effect of the requirements began in 2019. 4. States must have had at least one year in the past five calendar years before the year in which advances are taken in which the Average High Cost Multiple (AHCM) was greater than or equal to 1.0. 5. Additionally, states must meet two criteria for maintenance-of-tax effort in every year from the most recent year the AHCM was at least 1.0 and the year in which loans are taken. a. The average state unemployment tax rate (total state unemployment tax amount collected over total taxable wages) was at least 80% of the prior year's rate. b. The average state unemployment tax rate was at least 75% of the average benefit-cost ratio over the preceding five calendar years, where the benefit-cost ratio for a year is defined as the amount of benefits and interest paid in the year divided by the total covered wages paid in the year. Table 2 lists outstanding state loans. (At this time, only the U.S. Virgin Islands has an outstanding loan.) The table also includes information on accrued interest payments for FY2019.

{"input": "", "context": "FCC has not evaluated Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals but, as we found in May 2017, has taken recent steps toward evaluation. According to GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, to use public funds effectively the government must meet the demands of today’s changing world by employing effective management practices and processes, including the measurement of government program performance. In the past, FCC has called for program evaluations to review the administration of universal service generally, including Lifeline, but has not completed such evaluations. For example, FCC specified that it would review USAC 1 year after USAC was appointed as the permanent administrator to determine whether the universal service programs were being administered effectively. This review, which was planned to have been completed by 1999, was never done. In 2005, FCC awarded a contract to the National Academy of Public Administration to study the administration of the USF programs generally, examine the tradeoffs of continuing with the current structure, and identify ways to improve the oversight and operation of universal service programs. However, we reported in May 2017 that FCC officials stated FCC subsequently terminated the contract and the study was not conducted. In March 2015, we found that FCC had not evaluated Lifeline’s effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of ensuring the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. We recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. Our May 2017 report raised additional questions about Lifeline’s effectiveness in meeting its program goals. For example, we reported that: FCC did not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service (for which they pay out of pocket) along with their Lifeline benefit. Without knowing whether participants are using Lifeline as a primary or secondary phone service, we concluded that it is difficult for FCC to determine whether it is achieving the program’s goal of increasing telephone subscribership among low-income consumers while minimizing the USF contribution burden. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption and generally phase out phone service, in part because FCC recognized that most eligible consumers have phones without Lifeline and to also close the “digital divide” of broadband adoption between low-income households and the rest of the country. However, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. We found that at least two companies operating in a total of at least 21 states had begun offering in-home non-Lifeline broadband wireline support for less than $10 per month to individuals that participate in public- assistance programs, such as SNAP or public housing. The offered rate of these providers’ own low-income broadband service of $10 per month was less expensive than FCC’s broadband reasonable- comparability cost benchmark of approximately $55 per month, which Lifeline subscribers would be paying for a similar level of service. Our May 2017 report also found that FCC has recently taken some steps toward evaluating Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals. Specifically, in the 2016 Lifeline Modernization Order, FCC instructed USAC to hire an outside, independent, third-party evaluator to complete a program evaluation of Lifeline’s design, function, and administration. The order stipulated the outside evaluator must complete the evaluation and USAC must submit the findings to FCC by December 2020. As FCC expects Lifeline enrollment to increase as the program is expanded to include broadband service, this expansion could carry with it increased risks for fraud, waste, and abuse, as was the case with past expansions of the program. Completing the program evaluation as planned, and as we recommended in 2015, would help FCC determine whether Lifeline is meeting its stated goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income consumers, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. In our May 2017 report we found that FCC and USAC have established financial controls for Lifeline, including obtaining and reviewing information about billing, collecting, and disbursing funds. They have also developed plans to establish other controls, such as establishing a national eligibility verifier (National Verifier) for Lifeline providers to determine the eligibility of applicants seeking Lifeline service. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, we found that weaknesses remain, including the lack of requirements to effectively control program expenditures above approved levels, concerns about the transparency of fees on customers’ telephone bills, and a lack of FCC guidance that could result in Lifeline and other providers paying inconsistent USF contributions. To address these concerns, we recommended the Chairman of FCC (1) require Commissioners to review and approve, as appropriate, spending above the budget in a timely manner; (2) require a review of customer bills as part of the contribution audit to include an assessment of whether the charges, including USF fees, meet FCC Truth-in-billing rules with regard to labeling, so customer bills are transparent, and appropriately labeled and described, to help consumers detect and prevent unauthorized changes; and (3) respond to USAC requests for guidance and address pending requests concerning USF contribution requirements to ensure the contribution factor is based on complete information and that USF pass-through charges are equitable. FCC generally agreed with those recommendations. In addition, we found that USAC’s banking practices for the USF result in oversight and accountability risks that FCC has plans to mitigate. Specifically, FCC maintains USF funds—whose net assets as of September 2016 exceeded $9 billion—outside of the U.S. Treasury pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) advice provided in April 2000. OMB had concluded that the USF does not constitute public money subject to the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3302, a statute that requires that money received for the use of the United States be deposited in the Treasury unless otherwise authorized by law. As such, USF balances are held in a private bank account. However, subsequent to this OMB advice, in February 2005 we reported that FCC should reconsider this determination in light of the status of universal service monies as federal funds. As discussed in our May report, according to correspondence we received from the FCC Chairman’s Senior Legal Counsel, as of March 2017, FCC had decided to move the funds to the Treasury. FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds to the Treasury. For example, FCC explained that having the funds in the Treasury would provide USAC with better tools for fiscal management of the funds, including access to real- time data and more accurate and transparent data. According to FCC, until the USF is moved into the Treasury, there are also some oversight risks associated with holding the fund in a private account. For example, the contract governing the account does not provide FCC with authority to direct bank activities with respect to the funds in the event USAC ceases to be the administrator of the USF. After we raised this matter with FCC officials during the course of our review, beginning in November 2016, FCC sought to amend the contract between USAC and the bank to enable the bank to act on FCC instructions independently of USAC in the event USAC ceases to be the administrator. However, as of May 2017, the amended contract had not yet been signed. While FCC has put in place a preliminary plan to move the USF funds to the Treasury, as well as plans to amend the existing contract with the bank as an interim measure, several years have passed since this issue was brought to FCC’s attention without corrective actions being implemented. Further, under FCC’s preliminary plan, it would not be until next year, at the earliest, that the funds would be moved to the Treasury. In May 2017, while reviewing a draft of this report, a senior FCC official informed us that FCC experienced some challenges associated with moving the funds to the Treasury, such as coordinating across the various entities involved, which raised some questions as to when and perhaps whether the funds would be moved. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. As a result, in our May 2017 report, we recommended that the Chairman of FCC take action to ensure that the preliminary plans to transfer the USF funds from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented as expeditiously as possible. FCC agreed with this recommendation. FCC and USAC have implemented controls to improve subscriber eligibility verification, such as implementing the NLAD database in 2014, which helps carriers identify and resolve duplicate claims for Lifeline- supported services. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, our analysis of data from 2014, as well as our undercover attempts to obtain Lifeline service, revealed significant weaknesses in subscriber eligibility verification. Lifeline providers are generally responsible for verifying the eligibility of potential subscribers, but we found that their ability to do so is hindered by a lack of access to, or awareness of, state eligibility databases that can be used to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment. For example, not all states have databases that Lifeline providers can use to confirm eligibility and some providers with whom we spoke were unaware of databases that were potentially available to them. These challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. Additionally, since USAC was not maintaining and providing information to providers about these databases, we recommended they maintain and disseminate an updated list of state eligibility databases available to Lifeline providers that includes the qualifying programs those databases access to confirm eligibility, to help ensure Lifeline providers are aware of state eligibility databases and USAC audits of Lifeline providers can verify that available state databases are being utilized to verify subscriber eligibility. FCC agreed with the recommendation. For our May 2017 report, to identify Lifeline subscribers who were potentially ineligible to participate in the program, we tested the eligibility of subscribers who claimed participation in Medicaid, SNAP, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) using NLAD data as of November 2014. We focused our analysis on these three programs because FCC reported in 2012 that these were the three qualifying programs through which most subscribers qualify for Lifeline. We compared approximately 3.4 million subscribers who, according to information entered in NLAD, were eligible for Lifeline due to enrollment in one of these three programs to eligibility data for these programs. On the basis of our analysis of NLAD and public-assistance data, we could not confirm that a substantial portion of selected Lifeline beneficiaries were enrolled in the Medicaid, SNAP, and SSI programs, even though, according to the data, they qualified for Lifeline by stating on their applications that they participated in one of these programs. In total, we were unable to confirm whether 1,234,929 subscribers out of the 3,474,672 who we reviewed, or about 36 percent, participated in the qualifying benefit programs they stated on their Lifeline enrollment applications or were recorded as such by Lifeline providers. If providers claimed and received reimbursement for each of the 1.2 million subscribers, then the subsidy amount associated with these individuals equals $11.4 million per month, or $137 million annually, at the current subsidy rate of $9.25 per subscriber. Because Lifeline disbursements are based on providers’ reimbursement claims, not the number of subscribers a provider has in NLAD, our analysis of NLAD data could not confirm actual disbursements associated with these individuals. Given that our review was limited to those enrolled in SNAP or Medicaid in selected case-study states, and SSI in states that participated in NLAD at the time of our analysis, our data results are likely understated compared to the entire population of Lifeline subscribers. These results indicate that potential improper payments have occurred and have gone undetected. We plan to refer potentially ineligible subscribers identified through our analysis for appropriate action as warranted. Our undercover testing, as discussed in our May 2017 report, also found that Lifeline may be vulnerable to ineligible subscribers obtaining service and the testing found examples of Lifeline providers being nonresponsive, or providing inaccurate information. To conduct our 21 tests, we contacted 19 separate providers to apply for Lifeline service. We applied using documentation fictitiously stating that we were enrolled in an eligible public-assistance program or met the Lifeline income requirements. We were approved to receive Lifeline services by 12 of the 19 Lifeline providers using fictitious eligibility documentation. We also experienced instances during our undercover tests where our calls to providers were disconnected, and where Lifeline provider representatives transmitted erroneous information, or were unable to provide assistance on questions about the status of our application. For example, one Lifeline provider told us that our application was not accepted by the company because our signature had eraser marks; however our application had been submitted via an electronic form on the provider’s website and was not physically signed. While our tests are illustrative and not representative of all Lifeline providers or applications submitted, these results suggest that Lifeline providers do not always properly verify eligibility and that applicants may potentially encounter similar difficulties when applying for Lifeline benefits. As described above, these challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. FCC and USAC have implemented some mechanisms to enhance oversight of Lifeline providers, as discussed in our May 2017 report, but we found that remaining gaps could allow noncompliance with program rules. For example, in July 2014, FCC took additional measures to combat fraud, waste, and abuse by creating a strike force to investigate violations of USF program rules and laws. According to FCC, the creation of the strike force is part of the agency’s commitment to stopping fraud, waste, and abuse and policing the integrity of USF programs and funds. Similarly, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. However, we found FCC and USAC have limited oversight of Lifeline provider operations and the internal controls used to manage those operations. The current structure of the program relied throughout 2015 and 2016 on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers (ETC) to provide Lifeline service to eligible beneficiaries. These companies are relied on to not only provide telephone service, but also to create Lifeline applications, train employees and subcontractors, and make eligibility determinations for millions of applicants. USAC’s reliance on Lifeline providers to determine eligibility and subsequently submit accurate and factual invoices is a significant risk for allowing potentially improper payments to occur, and under current reporting guidelines these occurrences would likely go undetected and unreported. Federal internal control standards state that management retains responsibility for the performance and processes assigned to service organizations performing operational functions. Consistent with internal control standards, FCC and USAC would need to understand the extent to which a sample of these internal controls are designed and implemented effectively to ensure these controls are sufficient to address program risks and achieve the program’s objectives. We identified key Lifeline functions for which FCC and USAC had limited visibility. For example, we found instances of Lifeline providers utilizing domestic or foreign-operated call centers for Lifeline enrollment. When we asked FCC officials about Lifeline providers that outsource program functions to call centers, including those overseas, they told us that such information is not tracked by FCC or USAC. With no visibility over these call centers, FCC and USAC do not have a way to verify whether such call centers comply with Lifeline rules. FCC and USAC have limited knowledge about potentially adverse incentives that providers might offer employees to enroll subscribers. For example, some Lifeline providers pay commissions to third-party agents to enroll subscribers, creating a financial incentive to enroll as many subscribers as possible. Companies responsible for distributing Lifeline phones and service that use incentives for employees to enroll subscribers for monetary benefit increase the possibility of fictitious or ineligible individuals being enrolled into Lifeline. Highlighting the extent of the potential risk for companies, in April 2016 FCC announced approximately $51 million in proposed fines against one Lifeline provider, due to, among other things, its sales agents purposely enrolling tens of thousands of ineligible and duplicate subscribers in Lifeline using shared or improper eligibility documentation. To test internal controls over employees associated with Lifeline for our May 2017 report, we sought employment with a company that enrolls individuals to Lifeline. We were hired by a company and were allowed to enroll individuals in Lifeline without ever meeting any company representatives, conducting an employment interview, or completing a background check. After we were hired, we completed two fictitious Lifeline applications as an employee of the company, successfully enrolled both of these fictitious subscribers into Lifeline using fabricated eligibility documentation, and received compensation for these enrollments. The results of these tests are illustrative and cannot be generalized to any other Lifeline provider. We plan to refer this company for appropriate action as warranted. As stated above, these challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. In addition, in May 2017, we made two recommendations to help address control weaknesses and related program-integrity risks. Specifically, we recommended that FCC establish time frames to evaluate compliance plans and develop instructions with criteria for FCC reviewers how to evaluate these plans to meet Lifeline’s program goals. We also recommended that FCC develop an enforcement strategy that details what violations lead to penalties and apply this as consistently as possible to all Lifeline providers to ensure consistent enforcement of program violations. FCC generally agreed with these recommendations. In conclusion, Lifeline’s large and diffuse administrative structure creates a complex internal control environment susceptible to significant risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. FCC’s and USAC’s limited oversight of important aspects of program operations further complicates the control environment—heightening program risk. We are encouraged by FCC’s recent steps to address weaknesses we identified, such as the 2016 order establishing a National Verifier, which, if implemented as planned, could further help to address weaknesses in the eligibility-determination process. We also plan to monitor the implementation status of the recommendations we made in May 2017. Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared remarks.

Lifeline reimburses telephone companies that offer discounts through the USF, which in turn is generally supported by consumers by means of a fee charged on their telephone bills. This testimony is based on GAO's May 2017 report and discusses steps FCC has taken to measure Lifeline's performance in meeting goals; steps FCC and USAC have taken to enhance controls over finances, subscribers, and providers; and any weaknesses that might remain. For the May 2017 report, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from FCC and USAC. GAO also analyzed subscriber data from 2014 and performed undercover tests to identify potential improper payment vulnerabilities. The results of this analysis and testing are illustrative, not generalizable. In its May 2017 report, GAO found the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated the Lifeline program's (Lifeline) performance in meeting its goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income households by providing financial support, but it has recently taken steps to begin to do so. FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. In its May 2017 report, GAO made seven recommendations, including that FCC ensure plans to transfer the USF from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented expeditiously. FCC generally agreed with all the recommendations."], "length": 3956, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fa5a9d9cd641dccda7580dc34bdcc204b4adf85d2fd0004f"}
{"input": "", "context": "FCC has not evaluated Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals but, as we found in May 2017, has taken recent steps toward evaluation. According to GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, to use public funds effectively the government must meet the demands of today’s changing world by employing effective management practices and processes, including the measurement of government program performance. In the past, FCC has called for program evaluations to review the administration of universal service generally, including Lifeline, but has not completed such evaluations. For example, FCC specified that it would review USAC 1 year after USAC was appointed as the permanent administrator to determine whether the universal service programs were being administered effectively. This review, which was planned to have been completed by 1999, was never done. In 2005, FCC awarded a contract to the National Academy of Public Administration to study the administration of the USF programs generally, examine the tradeoffs of continuing with the current structure, and identify ways to improve the oversight and operation of universal service programs. However, we reported in May 2017 that FCC officials stated FCC subsequently terminated the contract and the study was not conducted. In March 2015, we found that FCC had not evaluated Lifeline’s effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of ensuring the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. We recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. Our May 2017 report raised additional questions about Lifeline’s effectiveness in meeting its program goals. For example, we reported that: FCC did not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service (for which they pay out of pocket) along with their Lifeline benefit. Without knowing whether participants are using Lifeline as a primary or secondary phone service, we concluded that it is difficult for FCC to determine whether it is achieving the program’s goal of increasing telephone subscribership among low-income consumers while minimizing the USF contribution burden. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption and generally phase out phone service, in part because FCC recognized that most eligible consumers have phones without Lifeline and to also close the “digital divide” of broadband adoption between low-income households and the rest of the country. However, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. We found that at least two companies operating in a total of at least 21 states had begun offering in-home non-Lifeline broadband wireline support for less than $10 per month to individuals that participate in public- assistance programs, such as SNAP or public housing. The offered rate of these providers’ own low-income broadband service of $10 per month was less expensive than FCC’s broadband reasonable- comparability cost benchmark of approximately $55 per month, which Lifeline subscribers would be paying for a similar level of service. Our May 2017 report also found that FCC has recently taken some steps toward evaluating Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals. Specifically, in the 2016 Lifeline Modernization Order, FCC instructed USAC to hire an outside, independent, third-party evaluator to complete a program evaluation of Lifeline’s design, function, and administration. The order stipulated the outside evaluator must complete the evaluation and USAC must submit the findings to FCC by December 2020. As FCC expects Lifeline enrollment to increase as the program is expanded to include broadband service, this expansion could carry with it increased risks for fraud, waste, and abuse, as was the case with past expansions of the program. Completing the program evaluation as planned, and as we recommended in 2015, would help FCC determine whether Lifeline is meeting its stated goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income consumers, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. In our May 2017 report we found that FCC and USAC have established financial controls for Lifeline, including obtaining and reviewing information about billing, collecting, and disbursing funds. They have also developed plans to establish other controls, such as establishing a national eligibility verifier (National Verifier) for Lifeline providers to determine the eligibility of applicants seeking Lifeline service. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, we found that weaknesses remain, including the lack of requirements to effectively control program expenditures above approved levels, concerns about the transparency of fees on customers’ telephone bills, and a lack of FCC guidance that could result in Lifeline and other providers paying inconsistent USF contributions. To address these concerns, we recommended the Chairman of FCC (1) require Commissioners to review and approve, as appropriate, spending above the budget in a timely manner; (2) require a review of customer bills as part of the contribution audit to include an assessment of whether the charges, including USF fees, meet FCC Truth-in-billing rules with regard to labeling, so customer bills are transparent, and appropriately labeled and described, to help consumers detect and prevent unauthorized changes; and (3) respond to USAC requests for guidance and address pending requests concerning USF contribution requirements to ensure the contribution factor is based on complete information and that USF pass-through charges are equitable. FCC generally agreed with those recommendations. In addition, we found that USAC’s banking practices for the USF result in oversight and accountability risks that FCC has plans to mitigate. Specifically, FCC maintains USF funds—whose net assets as of September 2016 exceeded $9 billion—outside of the U.S. Treasury pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) advice provided in April 2000. OMB had concluded that the USF does not constitute public money subject to the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3302, a statute that requires that money received for the use of the United States be deposited in the Treasury unless otherwise authorized by law. As such, USF balances are held in a private bank account. However, subsequent to this OMB advice, in February 2005 we reported that FCC should reconsider this determination in light of the status of universal service monies as federal funds. As discussed in our May report, according to correspondence we received from the FCC Chairman’s Senior Legal Counsel, as of March 2017, FCC had decided to move the funds to the Treasury. FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds to the Treasury. For example, FCC explained that having the funds in the Treasury would provide USAC with better tools for fiscal management of the funds, including access to real- time data and more accurate and transparent data. According to FCC, until the USF is moved into the Treasury, there are also some oversight risks associated with holding the fund in a private account. For example, the contract governing the account does not provide FCC with authority to direct bank activities with respect to the funds in the event USAC ceases to be administrator of the USF. After we raised this matter with FCC officials during the course of our review, beginning in November 2016, FCC sought to amend the contract between USAC and the bank to enable the bank to act on FCC instructions independently of USAC in the event USAC ceases to be the administrator. However, as of May 2017, the amended contract had not yet been signed. While FCC has put in place a preliminary plan to move the USF funds to the Treasury, as well as plans to amend the existing contract with the bank as an interim measure, several years have passed since this issue was brought to FCC’s attention without corrective actions being implemented. Further, under FCC’s preliminary plan, it would not be until next year, at the earliest, that the funds would be moved to the Treasury. In May 2017, while reviewing a draft of this report, a senior FCC official informed us that FCC experienced some challenges associated with moving the funds to the Treasury, such as coordinating across the various entities involved, which raised some questions as to when and perhaps whether the funds would be moved. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. As a result, in our May 2017 report, we recommended that the Chairman of FCC take action to ensure that the preliminary plans to transfer the USF funds from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented as expeditiously as possible. FCC agreed with this recommendation. FCC and USAC have implemented controls to improve subscriber eligibility verification, such as implementing the NLAD database in 2014, which helps carriers identify and resolve duplicate claims for Lifeline- supported services. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, our analysis of data from 2014, as well as our undercover attempts to obtain Lifeline service, revealed significant weaknesses in subscriber eligibility verification. Lifeline providers are generally responsible for verifying the eligibility of potential subscribers, but we found that their ability to do so is hindered by a lack of access to, or awareness of, state eligibility databases that can be used to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment. For example, not all states have databases that Lifeline providers can use to confirm eligibility and some providers with whom we spoke were unaware of databases that were potentially available to them. These challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. Additionally, since USAC was not maintaining and providing information to providers about these databases, we recommended they maintain and disseminate an updated list of state eligibility databases available to Lifeline providers that includes the qualifying programs those databases access to confirm eligibility, to help ensure Lifeline providers are aware of state eligibility databases and USAC audits of Lifeline providers can verify that available state databases are being utilized to verify subscriber eligibility. FCC agreed with the recommendation. For our May 2017 report, to identify Lifeline subscribers who were potentially ineligible to participate in the program, we tested the eligibility of subscribers who claimed participation in Medicaid, SNAP, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) using NLAD data as of November 2014. We focused our analysis on these three programs because FCC reported in 2012 that these were the three qualifying programs through which most subscribers qualify for Lifeline. We compared approximately 3.4 million subscribers who, according to information entered in NLAD, were eligible for Lifeline due to enrollment in one of these three programs to eligibility data for these programs.

If providers claimed and received reimbursement for each of the 1.2 million subscribers, then the subsidy amount associated with these individuals equals $11.4 million per month, or $137 million annually, at the current subsidy rate of $9.25 per subscriber. Because Lifeline disbursements are based on providers’ reimbursement claims, not the number of subscribers a provider has in NLAD, our analysis of NLAD data could not confirm actual disbursements associated with these individuals. Given that our review was limited to those enrolled in SNAP or Medicaid in selected case-study states, and SSI in states that participated in NLAD at the time of our analysis, our data results are likely understated compared to the entire population of Lifeline subscribers.

FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. In its May 2017 report, GAO made seven recommendations, including that FCC ensure plans to transfer the USF from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented expeditiously. FCC generally agreed with all the recommendations."], "length": 3955, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2562c68308e254c936f0c6e40ef0cd6136e98adb74ed8651"}
{"input": "", "context": "S ince the 1970s, policymakers have increasingly used the tax code to promote energy policy goals. Long-term energy policy goals include providing a secure supply of energy, providing energy at a low cost, and ensuring that energy production and consumption is consistent with environmental objectives. A range of federal policies, including various research and development programs, mandates, and direct financial support such as tax incentives or loan guarantees, promotes various energy policy objectives. This report focuses on tax incentives that support the production of or investment in various energy resources. Through the mid-2000s, the majority of revenue losses associated with energy tax incentives were from provisions benefiting fossil fuels. At present, the balance has shifted, such that the bulk of federal revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions are from incentives for renewable energy production and investment. While there has been growth in the amount of energy from renewable resources, the majority of domestic energy produced continues to be from fossil energy resources. This has raised questions regarding the value of energy tax incentives relative to production and the relative subsidization of various energy resources. Although the numbers in this report may be useful for policymakers evaluating the current status of energy tax policy, it is important to understand the limitations of this analysis. This report evaluates energy production relative to the value of current energy tax expenditures. It does not, however, seek to analyze whether the current system of energy tax incentives is economically efficient, effective, or otherwise consistent with broader energy policy objectives. Further, analysis in this report does not include information on federal spending on energy that is not linked to the tax code. The following sections estimate the value of tax incentives relative to the level of energy produced using fossil and renewable energy resources. Before proceeding with the analysis, some limitations are outlined. The analysis itself requires quantification of energy production and energy tax incentives. Once data on energy production and energy tax incentives have been presented, the value of energy tax incentives can be evaluated relative to current levels of energy production. The analysis below provides a broad comparison of the relative tax support for fossil fuels as compared with the relative support for renewables. Various data limitations prevent a precise analysis of the amount of subsidy per unit of production across different energy resources. Limitations associated with this type of analysis include the following: Current-year tax incentives may not directly support current-year production . Many of the tax incentives available for energy resources are designed to encourage investment, rather than production. For example, the expensing of intangible drilling costs (IDCs) for oil and gas provides an incentive to invest in capital equipment and exploration. Although the ability to expense IDCs does not directly support current production of crude oil and natural gas, such subsidies are expected to increase long-run supply. Differing levels of federal financial support may or may not reflect underlying policy rationales . Various policy rationales may exist for federal interventions in energy markets. Interventions may be designed to achieve various economic, social, or other policy objectives. Although analysis of federal financial support per unit of energy production may help inform the policy debate, it does not directly consider why various energy sources may receive different levels of federal financial support. Tax expenditures are estimates . The tax expenditure data provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are estimates of federal revenue losses associated with specific provisions. These estimates do not provide information on actual federal revenue losses, nor do these estimates reflect the amount of revenue that would be raised should the provision be eliminated. Additionally, the JCT advises that tax expenditures across provisions not be summed, due to interaction effects. Tax expenditure data are not specific to energy source . Many tax incentives are available to a variety of energy resources. For example, the tax expenditure associated with the expensing of IDCs does not distinguish between revenue losses associated with natural gas versus those associated with oil. The tax expenditure for five-year accelerated depreciation also does not specify how much of the benefit accrues to various eligible technologies, such as wind and solar. A number of tax provisions that support energy are not energy specific . The U.S. energy sector benefits from a number of tax provisions that are not targeted at energy. For example, the production activities deduction (Section 199), before being repealed in the 2017 tax act ( P.L. 115-97 ), benefited all domestic manufacturers. For the purposes of the Section 199 deduction, oil and gas extraction was considered a domestic manufacturing activity. Certain energy-related activities may also benefit from other tax incentives that are available to non-energy industries, such as the ability to issue tax-exempt debt, the ability to structure as a master limited partnership, or tax incentives designed to promote other activities, such as research and development. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides annual data on U.S. primary energy production. EIA defines primary energy as energy that exists in a naturally occurring form, before being converted into an end-use product. For example, coal is considered primary energy, which is typically combusted to create steam and then electricity. This report relies on 2017 data on U.S. primary energy production (see Table 1 ). In 2017, most primary energy was produced using fossil fuels. Natural gas was the largest source of primary energy production, accounting for 32.0% of primary energy produced. Crude oil accounted for 22.1% of U.S. primary energy production in 2017, and coal accounted for 17.7%. Taken together, fossil energy sources were used for 77.7% of 2017 primary energy production. The remaining U.S. primary energy production is attributable to nuclear electric and renewable energy resources. Overall, 9.5% of 2017 U.S. primary energy was produced as nuclear electric energy. Renewables (including hydroelectric power) constituted 12.8% of 2017 U.S. primary energy production. Biomass was the largest source of primary production among the renewables in 2017, accounting for 5.9% of overall primary energy production and 46.1% of renewable energy production. This was followed by hydroelectric power at 3.1% and wind energy at 2.7% of primary energy production. Solar energy and geothermal energy were responsible for 0.9% and 0.2%, respectively, of 2017 primary energy production (see Table 1 ). Primary energy produced using biomass can be further categorized as biomass being used to produce biofuels (e.g., ethanol) and biomass being used to generate biopower. Of the 5.2 quadrillion Btu of energy produced using biomass, about 2.3 quadrillion Btu was used in the production of biofuels. The tax code supports the energy sector by providing a number of targeted tax incentives, or tax incentives only available for the energy industry. In addition to targeted tax incentives, the energy sector may also benefit from a number of broader tax provisions that are available for energy- and non-energy-related taxpayers. These broader tax incentives are not included in the analysis, since tax expenditure estimates do not indicate how much of the revenue loss associated with these generally available provisions is associated with energy-related activities. Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) tax expenditure estimates are used to tabulate federal revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions. The tax expenditure estimates provided by the JCT are forecasted revenue losses. These revenue losses are not reestimated on the basis of actual economic conditions. Thus, revenue losses presented below are projected, as opposed to actual revenue losses. The JCT advises that individual tax expenditures cannot be simply summed to estimate the aggregate revenue loss from multiple tax provisions. This is because of interaction effects. When the revenue loss associated with a specific tax provision is estimated, the estimate is made assuming that there are no changes in other provisions or in taxpayer behavior. When individual tax expenditures are summed, the interaction effects may lead to different revenue loss estimates. Consequently, aggregate tax expenditure estimates, derived from summing the estimated revenue effects of individual tax expenditure provisions, are unlikely to reflect the actual change in federal receipts associated with removing various tax provisions. Thus, total tax expenditure figures presented below are an estimate of federal revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions, and should not be interpreted as actual federal revenue losses. Table 2 provides information on revenue losses and outlays associated with energy-related tax provisions in FY2017 and FY2018. The FY2017 figures are included to facilitate comparison with the primary energy production using different energy resources. Since the tax code was substantially changed beginning in 2018, FY2018 tax expenditures are also included. In 2017, the tax code provided an estimated $17.8 billion in support for the energy sector. More than one-third of the 2017 total, $6.4 billion, was due to the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC). Nine different provisions supporting fossil fuels had an estimated cost of $4.6 billion, collectively, in 2017. This declined to $3.2 billion for 2018. While the tax legislation enacted late in 2017 ( P.L. 115-97 ) did not directly change fossil-fuel-related tax provisions, other changes, including the reduced corporate tax rate, lowered the tax savings associated with various tax incentives for fossil fuels. While the majority of federal tax-related support for energy in 2017 can be attributed to either fossil fuels or renewables, provisions supporting energy efficiency, alternative technology vehicles, and nuclear energy also resulted in forgone revenue in 2017 and 2018. Table 3 provides a side-by-side comparison of fossil fuel and renewable production, along with the cost of tax incentives supporting fossil fuel and renewable energy resources. During 2017, 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production could be attributed to fossil fuel sources. Of the federal tax support targeted to energy in 2017, an estimated 25.8% of the value went toward supporting fossil fuels. During 2017, an estimated 12.8% of U.S. primary source energy was produced using renewable resources. Of the federal tax support targeted to energy in 2017, an estimated 65.2% went toward supporting renewables. Table 3 also contains information on subcategories of renewables, specifically (1) renewables excluding hydro and (2) renewables excluding biofuels. Excluding hydro might be instructive since current energy production is the result of past investment decisions, some of which may not have benefited from targeted tax incentives. Thus, it may not always be appropriate to compare the current value of tax incentives to current levels of energy production. For example, energy generated using hydroelectric power technologies might be excluded from the renewables category, as most existing hydro-generating capacity was installed before the early 1990s. Thus, there is no current federal tax benefit for most electricity currently generated using hydropower. Further, with many of the best hydro sites already developed, there is limited potential for growth in conventional hydropower capacity. There is, however, potential for development of additional electricity-generating capacity through smaller hydro projects that could substantially increase U.S. hydroelectric generation capacity. Excluding hydro from the renewables category, or removing an energy resource where the development was not likely supported by current renewables-related tax incentives, nonhydro renewables accounted for 9.7% of 2017 primary energy production (see Table 3 ). During 2017, certain tax expenditures for renewable energy did, however, benefit taxpayers developing and operating hydroelectric power facilities. Certain hydroelectric installations, including efficiency improvements or capacity additions at existing facilities, may be eligible for the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC). Given that hydro is supported by 2017 tax expenditures, one could also argue that for the purposes of the comparison being made in this report, hydro should be included in the renewables category. It may also be instructive to consider incentives that generally support renewable electricity separately from those that support biofuels. Of the estimated $17.8 billion in energy tax provisions in 2017, an estimated $2.1 billion, or 11.8%, went toward supporting biofuels. Excluding tax incentives for biofuels, 53.4% of energy-related tax incentives in 2017 were attributable to renewables. In other words, excluding biofuels from the analysis reduces the share of tax incentives attributable to renewables from 65.2% to 53.4% (see Table 3 ). Excluding biofuels from the analysis also reduces renewables' share of primary energy production. When biofuels are excluded, the share of primary energy produced in 2017 attributable to renewables falls by 2.7 percentage points, from 12.8% to 10.1% ( Table 3 ). In 2017, 9.5% of primary energy produced was from nuclear resources. The one tax benefit for nuclear with a positive tax expenditure in 2017 was the special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds. At $0.2 billion in 2017, this was 1.7% of the value of all tax expenditures for energy included in the analysis. Like many other energy-related tax expenditures, the special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds is not directly related to current energy production. Instead, this provision reduces the cost of investing in nuclear energy by taxing income from nuclear decommissioning reserve funds at a preferred rate (a flat rate of 20%). Over time, there have been substantial shifts in the proportion of energy-related tax expenditures benefiting different types of energy resources. Figure 1 illustrates the projected value of energy-related tax incentives since 1978. Energy tax provisions are categorized as primarily benefiting fossil fuels, renewables, renewable fuels, efficiency, vehicles, or some other energy purpose. Until the mid-2000s, most of the value of energy-related tax incentives supported fossil fuels. Starting in the mid-2000s, the cost of energy-related tax preferences supporting renewables increased. Some of this increase was attributable to provisions supporting renewable fuels, which have since expired. From the 1980s through 2011, most of the tax-related federal financial support for renewable energy was for renewable fuels, mainly alcohol fuels (i.e., ethanol). The tax credits for alcohol fuels (including ethanol) expired at the end of 2011. Starting in 2008, the federal government incurred outlays associated with excise tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Under current law, the tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel expired at the end of 2017. Thus, after FY2018 (which includes the end of calendar year 2017), there are no projected costs associated with tax incentives for renewable fuels. Expired tax incentives may be extended, however, as part of the \"tax extenders.\" Beginning in the mid-2000s, the cost of energy tax incentives for renewables began to increase. Beginning in 2009, the Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits contributed to increased costs associated with tax-related benefits for renewable energy. Through 2014, Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits exceeded tax expenditures associated with the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) combined. The Section 1603 grant option is not available for projects that began construction after December 31, 2011. However, since grants are paid out when construction is completed and eligible property is placed in service, outlays under the Section 1603 program continued through 2017. Tax expenditures for the ITC and PTC have increased substantially in recent years. As a result of the extensions for wind and solar enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), ITC and PTC tax expenditures are projected to remain stable for several years. Under current law, the PTC will not be available to projects that begin construction after December 31, 2019. However, since the PTC is available for the first 10 years of renewable electricity production, and the expiration date is a start-of-construction deadline as opposed to a placed-in-service deadline, PTC tax expenditures will continue after the provision expires. The ITC for solar, currently 30%, is scheduled to decline to 26% for property beginning construction in 2020, and 22% for property beginning construction in 2021, before returning to the permanent rate of 10% after 2021. Thus, absent additional policy changes, the higher tax expenditures associated with the PTC and ITC are expected to be temporary. Tax expenditures for tax incentives supporting energy efficiency increased in the late 2000s, but subsequently declined. Most of the increase in revenue losses for efficiency-related provisions was associated with tax incentives for homeowners investing in certain energy-efficient property. The primary tax incentive for energy efficiency improvements to existing homes expired at the end of 2017. Extension of expired tax incentives for energy efficiency would increase the cost of energy efficiency-related tax incentives. As was noted above, many energy-related tax provisions, particularly those that support renewables, are temporary. Over time as these incentives phase out, tax expenditures associated with these provisions will decline. This process may take some time. For the PTC, for example, the credit is claimed during the first 10 years of qualifying production. It is possible that qualifying production begins after the December 31, 2019, start-of-construction expiration date, meaning that tax expenditures for the PTC are expected to continue for at least the next decade. U.S. Department of the Treasury tax expenditure estimates can be used to illustrate how expiring provisions affect the distribution of energy-related tax expenditures over time (see Figure 2 ). Treasury and JCT tax expenditure estimates differ in a number of ways. The Treasury provides tax expenditures over an 11-year budget window. The JCT uses a shorter 5-year window. The JCT and Treasury also use different methodologies when preparing tax expenditure estimates, and have different classifications as to what provisions constitute tax expenditures. Thus, the tax expenditure estimates prepared by each entity are not directly comparable. However, looking at Treasury tax expenditure estimates over time can illustrate broader trends regarding which types of energy are receiving tax-related benefits. In 2018, according to Treasury's tax expenditure estimates, tax expenditures supporting renewables totaled an estimated $8.4 billion. By 2028, that number is expected to decline to $3.5 billion. The decline can be explained by the reduced tax expenditures for the PTC and ITC as these provisions phase down or expire. Treasury estimates that tax expenditures supporting fossil fuels will total $2.2 billion in 2018. The Treasury anticipates this number increasing over time, reaching an estimated $3.8 billion by 2028. The Treasury estimates that the revenue losses associated with most permanent oil-and-gas tax incentives will increase over the next decade. The energy sector is supported by an array of tax incentives reflecting diverse policy objectives. As a result, the amount of tax-related federal financial support for energy differs across energy sectors, and is not necessarily proportional to the amount of energy production from various energy sectors. The total amount of energy-related tax incentives is projected to decline under current law, although extensions of expired energy tax provisions, or other modifications to energy tax provisions, could change these figures. Over the longer term, the amount of tax-related support for the energy sector could decline if provisions are allowed to expire as scheduled under current law. ", "answers": ["The U.S. tax code supports the energy sector by providing a number of targeted tax incentives, or tax incentives available only for the energy industry. Some policymakers have expressed interest in understanding how energy tax benefits are distributed across different domestic energy resources. For example, what percentage of energy-related tax benefits support fossil fuels (or support renewables)? How much domestic energy is produced using fossil fuels (or produced using renewables)? And how do these figures compare? In 2017, the value of federal tax-related support for the energy sector was estimated to be $17.8 billion. Of this, $4.6 billion (25.8%) can be attributed to tax incentives supporting fossil fuels. Tax-related support for renewables was an estimated $11.6 billion in 2017 (or 65.2% of total tax-related support for energy). The remaining tax-related support went toward nuclear energy, efficiency measures, and alternative technology vehicles. While the cost of tax incentives for renewables has exceeded the cost of incentives for fossil fuels in recent years, the majority of energy produced in the United States continues to be derived from fossil fuels. In 2017, fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production. The remaining primary energy production is attributable to renewable energy and nuclear electric resources, with shares of 12.8% and 9.5%, respectively. The balance of energy-related tax incentives has changed over time, and it is projected to continue to change, under current law, in coming years. Factors that have contributed to recent changes in the balance of energy-related tax incentives include the following: Increased tax expenditures for solar and wind. Tax expenditures associated with the energy credit for solar and the production tax credit for wind have increased substantially in recent years. Following the long-term extensions of these temporary tax benefits provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), tax expenditures for the solar energy credit are projected to remain stable for several years, before decreasing in the longer term. The expiration of tax-related support for renewable fuels. Tax-related support for renewable fuels declined substantially after the tax credits for alcohol fuels were allowed to expire at the end of 2011. Other fuels-related incentives also expired at the end of 2017 (although these may be extended as part of the \"tax extenders\"). Decline then increase in tax expenditures for fossil fuels. Tax expenditures for fossil fuels declined between 2017 and 2018, an indirect effect of the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97). Over time, however, the tax expenditures associated with permanent fossil fuels tax incentives are estimated to increase. One starting point for evaluating energy tax policy may be a calculation of subsidy relative to production level. However, a complete policy analysis might consider why the level of federal financial support differs across various energy technologies. Tax incentives for energy may support various environmental or economic objectives. For example, tax incentives designed to reduce reliance on imported petroleum may be consistent with energy security goals. Tax incentives that promote renewable energy resources may be consistent with certain environmental objectives."], "length": 3582, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "696ffc1495c6e4840e7932648c36f847483e7cf79136fa91"}
{"input": "", "context": "The DEA, within the Department of Justice, is responsible for ensuring the availability of controlled substances for legitimate uses while preventing their diversion through its administration and enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations. Under the Controlled Substances Act, all persons or entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances are required to register with DEA, unless specifically exempted. DEA regulates these entities to limit diversion and prevent abuse. For example, DEA regulates pharmaceutical companies that manufacture controlled substances, health care providers who prescribe them to patients, and pharmacies that dispense them. In October 2010, the Disposal Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to deliver unused controlled substances to an entity authorized by DEA to dispose of the substances. DEA was given responsibility for promulgating the implementing regulations, and the Disposal Act stipulated that the regulations should prevent diversion of controlled substances while also taking into consideration public health and safety, ease and cost of implementation, and participation by various communities. In addition to disposal bins, DEA’s regulations describe two other options for the public to transfer controlled substances for the purpose of disposal: mail-back programs and take-back events. Law enforcement agencies may use all three methods of drug disposal without the need for authorization by DEA. The Disposal Act stipulates that the regulations cannot require an entity to participate in or establish any of the disposal options. To participate as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, eligible entities—retail pharmacies, hospitals/clinics with an on-site pharmacy, narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, distributors, and drug manufacturers that are already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—must modify their DEA registration. According to DEA officials, such modification is free and simple to do. Eligible retail pharmacies or hospitals/clinics that become authorized collectors are able to install and maintain disposal bins in long-term care facilities in addition to their own location. DEA’s website contains a public search feature to identify authorized collectors located near a specific zip code or address. Authorized collectors must install, manage, and maintain the disposal bins following DEA regulations. For example, under DEA’s regulations for maintaining the disposal bins, the disposal bin must be securely fastened to a permanent structure, securely locked, substantially constructed with a permanent outer container and removable inner liner, and have a small opening that allows contents to be added but not removed; the bin must also prominently display a sign indicating which types of substances are acceptable; users must dispose the unused prescriptions into the collection receptacle themselves without handing them to staff at the pharmacy; the disposal bin must typically be located in an area where an employee is present and near where controlled substances are stored, and the bin must be made inaccessible to the public when an employee is not present; the inner liner of the disposal bin must meet certain requirements, including being waterproof, tamper-evident, tear-resistant, opaque, and having the size and identification number clearly labeled; and the installation and removal of inner liners must be performed under the supervision of at least two employees of the authorized collector. DEA regulations also require that all controlled substances collected in the disposal bin’s inner liners must be destroyed in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and rendered non-retrievable. According to DEA regulations, non-retrievable means that the physical and chemical conditions of the controlled substance must be permanently altered, thereby rendering the controlled substance unavailable and unusable for all practical purposes. Authorized collectors are permitted to destroy the inner liner on their premises if they have the capacity to do so. If not, the inner liners can be transported to a separate location to be destroyed. Typically, in this case, an authorized collector contracts with a reverse distributor to periodically remove, transport, and destroy the inner liners. DEA regulations require that two reverse distributor employees transport the inner liners directly to the disposal location without any unnecessary stops or stops of an extended duration. Authorized collectors must document certain information, including inner liner identification numbers and the dates that each liner is installed, removed, and transferred for destruction. The authorized collectors must maintain these records for 2 years. Figure 1 summarizes the steps involved in the collection of unused prescription drugs. About 3 percent of pharmacies and other eligible entities have voluntarily chosen to become DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, according to DEA data. As of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) of eligible entities—which are already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most of the authorized collectors— about 81 percent—were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. (See table 1). Narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, and distributors made up approximately 1 percent of the authorized collectors. We also found that participation rates varied by state, though in most states relatively few of the eligible entities had registered with DEA to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. In 44 states, less than 5 percent of the eligible entities had registered. (See figure 2 and appendix I for more information on the participation rates of authorized collectors in each state). As of April 2017, Connecticut, Missouri, and Maine had the lowest participation rates, with 0.11, 0.22, and 0.70 percent, respectively. In contrast, North Dakota had the highest participation rate, with 32.0 percent of its pharmacies and other eligible entities registered to be authorized collectors. The state with next highest participation rate was Alaska, with 8.96 percent. In North Dakota, the state’s Board of Pharmacy provides funding for authorized collectors to purchase and maintain the disposal bins. According to a board official, the board decided to fund these activities to increase participation rates and plans to continue its funding indefinitely using revenue generated from prescription drug licensing fees it collects. In addition, our analysis shows that about 82 percent of all authorized collectors were located in urban areas as of April 2017. However, when comparing the entities registered to be authorized collectors with the total number of eligible entities, we found that a larger percentage of the eligible entities in rural areas became authorized collectors compared with those in urban areas (see table 2). The data we obtained on the number of eligible and participating authorized collectors and their locations are the only available DEA data on the use of disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. According to DEA officials, the agency does not collect any other information on the use of disposal bins, such as the extent to which the bins are used, or the amount and types of prescription drugs deposited into the bins. For example, to minimize the risk of diversion, DEA regulations do not allow authorized collectors to open and inspect the inner liners of the disposal bins, so information on their contents cannot be collected. According to DEA officials, the agency is not responsible for collecting information on the amount and types of prescription drugs destroyed through the disposal bins. DEA officials told us that the agency views its responsibility solely as giving pharmacies and other eligible entities the opportunity to become authorized collectors. Though we do not have information on the extent to which individuals use DEA’s prescription drug disposal bins, we were able to estimate that as of April 2017, about half of the country’s population lived less than 5 miles away from a pharmacy or other DEA-authorized entity offering a prescription disposal bin. In 21 states, at least 50 percent of the state’s population lived within 5 miles of a prescription disposal bin. (See figure 3). While close to half of the nation’s population lived less than 5 miles from a disposal bin as of April 2017, the availability of nearby disposal bins varied significantly for people depending on whether they lived in an urban or a rural area. Specifically, about 52 percent of the population in urban areas lived less than 5 miles away from a disposal bin, compared to about 13 percent of the population in rural areas. Furthermore, about 44 percent of the population in rural areas lived even further away—more than 30 miles away from a disposal bin. An exception to this is North Dakota, where about 86 percent of its urban population and about 64 percent of its rural population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin. According to officials from the 11 stakeholder organizations we interviewed—which represent authorized collectors and long-term care facilities—several factors may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. These factors include the associated costs of participating, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. Costs: Stakeholders said that the costs associated with purchasing, installing, and managing the disposal bins is a factor that explains the relatively low rate of participation. One stakeholder told us that many eligible entities may decide that the benefit of participating does not outweigh the costs associated with doing so. Specifically, stakeholders told us that the major costs associated with participating include the one-time cost of purchasing and installing a disposal bin; the ongoing costs to train personnel to manage the bins; and the cost of contracting with a reverse distributor to periodically dispose of the bin’s inner liner and contents. Stakeholders gave varying examples of the specific costs associated with these investments. For example, one stakeholder estimated the yearly costs of maintaining a disposal bin ranged from $500 to $600 per location; another stakeholder said that the cost is thousands of dollars per location per year, but did not provide a specific estimate. These stakeholders added that costs can increase if the disposal bins fill more quickly and need to be emptied more often than expected. For their part, officials from the reverse distributor stakeholders we interviewed cited incinerating hazardous waste, the availability of incinerators, and the cost of personnel as factors that increase the cost of their services for authorized collectors. One reverse distributor stakeholder told us that there are not many incinerators available, requiring them to travel long distances to incinerate collected waste. The other reverse distributor stakeholder added that DEA’s requirement that a second employee be present during the transportation and disposal increases the cost of their services. While some stakeholders speculated that costs are a reason for low participation, a few stakeholders told us that the benefits are worth the costs. In fact, two stakeholders we spoke with told us that the benefit to the communities was so important that they decided to provide funding to retail pharmacies, alleviating an individual pharmacy’s concern about the cost of installing and maintaining the disposal bins. We found that as of April 2017, over a quarter of the 2,233 authorized collectors using disposal bins received external funding to pay for the costs associated with installing and maintaining the disposal bins. In addition, stakeholders told us that some localities have enacted laws known as extended producer responsibility ordinances, which require that pharmaceutical manufacturers pay for certain costs associated with drug disposal. When asked about the costs associated with operating disposal bins, DEA officials told us that addressing cost issues with eligible participants falls outside of their responsibilities. Uncertainty: Stakeholders also told us that uncertainty regarding how to comply with aspects of DEA’s regulations for prescription drug disposal bins affected their decisions to participate. One stakeholder added that many eligible entities decide not to participate because uncertainties over participation requirements could result in inadvertent non-compliance with DEA’s regulations. As an example of their uncertainty over some of the requirements governing the disposal bins, officials from both of the reverse distributor stakeholders we interviewed cited DEA’s non-retrievable standard for destruction of the inner liners of the bins. DEA requires that the method of destruction be sufficient to render all controlled substances non- retrievable, meaning that the physical and chemical conditions of the controlled substances must be permanently altered and unusable in order to prevent diversion for illicit purposes. Both reverse distributor stakeholders told us that they are uncertain about whether certain disposal methods meet this standard, and they said that the agency has not provided further guidance on how reverse distributors can meet this requirement. DEA officials told us that the agency responds to questions about whether a specific method of destruction meets the non-retrievable standard by telling the registrant to test the remnants after destruction, to see if any components of the controlled substance are still present. In its summary of the regulations implementing the Disposal Act, DEA stated that in order to allow for the development of various methods of destruction, the agency did not require a specific method of destruction as long as the desired result is achieved. However, DEA officials stated that to their knowledge, incineration is the only method known to meet the non-retrievable standard to date, but the officials hoped other methods will be developed in the future. When asked about the guidance they provide to authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs or those eligible to become authorized collectors, DEA officials told us that they post frequently-asked questions on their website, routinely answer questions from participants and others, and give training presentations at conferences that include information on the disposal bins. In our prior work, we found problems with DEA’s communication and guidance to stakeholders. In 2015, we recommended that DEA identify and implement cost-effective means for communicating regularly with pharmacies and other entities authorized to handle controlled substances. DEA agreed with the recommendation, and officials told us that, starting in August 2017, these entities can subscribe to DEA’s website to receive notifications when it is updated with new guidance. Stakeholders also noted that some DEA requirements related to disposal bins may conflict with other state and federal requirements governing the transportation and disposal of hazardous waste, which includes some controlled substances. For example, the two reverse distributor stakeholders told us that some incinerator permits issued by states require that hazardous waste be examined before incineration; however, DEA requirements do not allow the contents of the liners to be examined, even at the time of incineration. To address the incinerator permit requirements, one reverse distributor told us that they use the Environmental Protection Agency’s hazardous waste household exemption, which treats the liners as household waste and thereby allows incinerator facilities to destroy the liners without examining the contents or violating their state permit. In addition, some stakeholders raised concerns that DEA’s regulations may conflict with other federal regulations. For instance, one stakeholder noted that they recently learned that transporting the disposal bin’s inner liners could violate Department of Transportation regulations. DEA officials told us that they were aware of this, explaining that the conflict was between DEA’s requirement that controlled substances be transported in liners and the Department of Transportation’s requirement that this type of waste be transported in sturdy containers. According to DEA officials, this conflict has been resolved by the Department of Transportation allowing reverse distributors to place the liners inside sturdy containers kept on trucks. Participation in or Availability of Similar Efforts: Stakeholders said that some pharmacies and other eligible entities were already participating in other, similar efforts that allow for the safe disposal of controlled substances, and therefore they did not want to invest additional resources into participating as authorized collectors using disposal bins. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has an established process that long-term care facilities use to dispose of their unused controlled substances. As a result, all of the long-term care stakeholders told us that long-term care facilities may choose not to partner with pharmacies interested in placing disposal bins within their facilities because it adds significant cost and effort without any additional benefit. Furthermore, pharmacy stakeholders noted that because of the availability of other prescription drug collection efforts in their communities, they did not think that maintaining a disposal bin at their locations was needed. For example, two of the stakeholders explained that local law enforcement precincts already had a similar type of disposal bin in place to collect unused prescription drugs. DEA officials told us that they were aware of other options for the public and entities such as long-term care facilities that are not registered as authorized collectors to dispose of controlled substances. The officials also indicated that the availability of disposal options at law enforcement agencies contributes to the low participation rates among pharmacies as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 3373, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "dc1afcec9b546bb4416701e28661f0c245d9fc5f4a60c22e"}
{"input": "", "context": "Part of the Mariana Islands Archipelago, the CNMI is a chain of 14 islands in the western Pacific Ocean, just north of Guam and about 3,200 miles west of Hawaii. The CNMI has a total population of 53,890, according to the CNMI’s 2016 Household, Income, and Expenditures Survey. Almost 90 percent of the population (48,200) resided on the island of Saipan, with an additional 6 percent (3,056) on the island of Tinian and 5 percent (2,635) on the island of Rota. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 amended the U.S.– CNMI covenant to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI after a transition period. To provide for an orderly transition from the CNMI immigration system to the U.S. federal immigration system under the immigration laws of the United States, DHS established the CW program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers are able to obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI for up to a year. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 requires DHS to annually reduce the number of CW-1 permits until the number reaches zero by the end of the transition period. The act was amended in December 2014 to extend the transition period through December 31, 2019. The act was further amended in August 2017 to, among other things, (1) add 350 CW-1 permits to the fiscal year 2017 cap; (2) restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations; and (3) increase the CNMI education funding fee that employers must pay for each permit from $150 to $200. DHS determines the annual cap on CW-1 permits and the terms and conditions of the CW program. In November 2017, DHS set the cap for CW-1 permits for fiscal year 2018 through the end of the program (see table 1). The proposed bill, the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act (S. 2325), includes the following provisions, among others, that would affect the CW program: (1) the number of permits to be allocated each year, (2) the distribution of the permits, and (3) a new CW-3 worker designation. Under the terms of S. 2325, the number of permits issued may not exceed 13,000 during fiscal year 2019. Starting in fiscal year 2020, the number of permits issued may not exceed a number that is 500 fewer than the number issued during the immediately preceding fiscal year. Figure 1 shows the past and future numerical limits on CNMI-Only Transitional Worker permits established by DHS and the proposed numerical limits for permits under S. 2325. The limits shown for S. 2325 in figure 1 assume that employers would petition for, and DHS would issue, the maximum number of available permits for fiscal year 2019 and for each subsequent year. Under S. 2325, as under the current law, a permit for construction and extraction occupations would be issued only to extend a permit that was first issued before October 1, 2015. Also, S. 2325 would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider, in good faith, any comments or advice submitted by the CNMI governor, including any recommendation to reserve a number of permits each year for occupational categories necessary to maintain public health or safety in the commonwealth. S. 2325 proposes a new CW-3 worker designation. Foreign workers who are otherwise admissible would be eligible for CW-3 permits if they were admitted to the CNMI as CW-1 workers during fiscal year 2014 and every subsequent fiscal year beginning before the date of the enactment of S. 2325. These workers would receive a permit to remain in the CNMI for a 3-year period beginning on the date of S. 2325’s enactment. CW-3 permits could be renewed in 3-year increments during the transition period for workers who remain outside the United States for a continuous period of not less than 30 days during the 180-day period immediately preceding each such renewal. CW-3 permits would count against the numerical caps specified in S. 2325. The CNMI’s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has grown each year since 2012. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates that the CNMI’s GDP increased by almost 29 percent in 2016 after increasing by about 4 percent in 2015. BEA attributes this economic growth to a significant increase in visitor spending, particularly for casino gambling, and investment in the construction of a casino resort in Saipan and other hotel construction. Figure 2 shows the casino’s development site in Saipan before and during construction. The new casino opened for business on July 6, 2017. Since 1990, the CNMI’s tourism market has experienced considerable fluctuation, as evidenced by total annual visitor arrivals (see fig. 3). Visitor arrivals to the CNMI declined from a peak of 726,690 in fiscal year 1997 to a low of 338,106 in fiscal year 2011, or by 53 percent. However, since 2011, visitor arrivals have nearly doubled, reaching 653,150 in fiscal year 2017, and increased by 30 percent from 2016 to 2017. Data from the Marianas Visitors Authority show that the downward trend in Japanese arrivals from 2013 to 2017 was offset by the growth in arrivals from China and South Korea. While eligible Japanese and South Korean visitors enter the CNMI under the U.S. visa waiver program, Chinese visitors are not eligible for the program and are allowed to be temporarily present in the CNMI under DHS’s discretionary parole authority, according to DHS officials. DHS exercises parole authority to allow, on a case-by-case basis, eligible nationals of China to enter the CNMI temporarily as tourists when there is significant public benefit, according to DHS. Following consecutive annual decreases in the total number of employed workers from 2005 through 2013, employment has increased annually since 2014, according to CNMI tax data. Figure 4 shows the numbers of employed workers, both foreign and domestic, in the CNMI from 2001 through 2016. From 2013 to 2016, the number of employed workers increased by approximately 25 percent, from 23,344 to 29,215. As figure 4 shows, while the number and percentage of foreign workers fell between 2001 and 2016, foreign workers still constitute the majority of the CNMI workforce. Of the nearly 30,000 employed workers in the CNMI in 2016, more than half were foreign workers, according to CNMI tax data. The number of foreign workers fell from a peak of over 38,000 in 2002—roughly 75 percent of employed workers—to fewer than 16,000 in 2016. In contrast, since 2002, the number of domestic workers has fluctuated from year to year, ranging from about 10,500 to almost 13,700, but increased by 28 percent from 2013 to 2016. The CNMI economy continues to experience growing demand for workers. In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the number of CW-1 permits almost doubled, and since fiscal year 2016, the number of permits has approached the numerical limits on permits for those years. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CW-1 permits grew from 7,127 in fiscal year 2012 to more than 13,000 in fiscal year 2016. On October 14, 2016—2 weeks into fiscal year 2017—USCIS announced that it had received enough petitions to reach the CW-1 cap for fiscal year 2017 and would not accept requests for new permits for that year during the remaining 11 months. In May 2017, USCIS announced that it had received a sufficient number of petitions to reach the CW-1 cap for fiscal year 2018. Table 2 shows the CW-1 permit caps and numbers of permits approved for fiscal years 2012 through 2018. According to USCIS officials, as of January 26, 2018, fiscal year 2018 petitions were still being adjudicated. Our preliminary analysis of USCIS CW-1 permit data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 identified trends in CW-1 workers’ country of birth, occupation, and duration of employment. USCIS data showed a decline in the numbers of CW-1 permits for fiscal years 2017 through 2018 for workers born in each of the five countries listed most frequently on the petitions—the Philippines, China, South Korea, Bangladesh, and Japan (see table 3). As of January 17, 2018, the number of permits approved for workers born in the Philippines, who received the most permits for all 7 years of the CW program, had declined by 13 percent from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018 and by 26 percent from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018. Concurrent with construction of the casino and other tourism infrastructure, the number of CW-1 permits for workers born in China increased by almost 3,800 from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 and declined by about 3,500 from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. Our preliminary analysis indicates that as of January 17, 2018, USCIS had approved 750 CW-1 permits for construction workers for fiscal year 2018. This number represents a 75 percent decline from the nearly 3,000 permits approved for fiscal year 2017 (see table 4). This decline reflects new restrictions on future permits for workers in construction occupations. Of the 8,228 foreign workers who had been granted fiscal year 2018 permits as of January 17, 2018, 2,352 had maintained continuous employment in the CNMI since fiscal year 2014 (see table 5). Of the 2,352 workers with continuous employment in fiscal years 2014 through 2018, 1,905 workers (81 percent) were born in the Philippines.

L. No. 110-229, enacted in 2008, amended the U.S.-CNMI covenant to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI after a transition period. The law required the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a temporary work permit program for foreign workers. DHS is required to decrease the number of permits issued annually, reducing them to zero by the end of the transition period, scheduled for December 31, 2019. To implement the law, DHS established a new work permit program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers can obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI. The law was amended in August 2017 to, among other things, restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations. Proposed legislation—Senate bill S. 2325—would, among other things, extend the transition period through December 31, 2029; increase the number of available permits from the 2018 level; and set required decreases in the annual numerical limit for the permits. (See figure for past numerical limits established by DHS and future limits proposed by S. 2325.) This testimony discusses (1) recent trends in the CNMI economy and (2) preliminary observations about the number of approved CW-1 permits and characteristics of permit holders, drawn from GAO's ongoing work. GAO updated information about the CNMI's economy that it reported in May 2017 (see GAO-17-437 ). GAO also analyzed data and documents from U.S. agencies and the CNMI government. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' (CNMI) inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has grown each year since 2012, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In 2016, the CNMI's GDP rose by 29 percent, partly as a result of construction investment. While tourism has fluctuated in recent years, visitor arrivals in the CNMI rose by nearly a third from 2016 to 2017. After nearly a decade of annual decline, the total number of workers employed in the CNMI increased from 2013 through 2016, according to the most recent available CNMI tax data. Foreign workers made up 53 percent of those employed in 2016, compared with roughly 75 percent in 2002. GAO's preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CNMI-Only Transitional Worker (CW-1) permits for foreign workers in the CNMI grew from over 7,100 for fiscal year 2012 to nearly 13,000 for fiscal year 2017. In addition, GAO identified trends in the country of birth, occupation, and employment duration of foreign workers with CW-1 permits approved for fiscal years 2012 through 2018. Workers born in the Philippines received the highest number of CW-1 permits each year. As of January 2018, 750 CW-1 permits had been granted to construction workers for fiscal year 2018—a 75 percent decline from the prior fiscal year. GAO estimated that approximately 2,350 foreign workers with approved CW-1 permits maintained continuous employment in the CNMI from fiscal year 2014 through January 2018. About 80 percent of these workers were born in the Philippines."], "length": 2202, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d1d5498b810d6a3e59553c6813a13a3f4371bd3a9fda0a91"}
{"input": "", "context": "The FAR establishes several types of source selection procedures, which include the tradeoff procedure on one end of the best value continuum and LPTA procedures on the other end. (see fig. 1). DOD may elect to use the LPTA procedure where the requirement is clearly defined and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal. In such cases, DOD has determined that cost or price should play a dominant role in the source selection. When using LPTA procedures, DOD specifies its minimum requirements in the solicitation. Firms submit their proposals and DOD determines which of the proposals meet or exceed those requirements, no tradeoffs between cost or price and non-cost factors (for example, technical capabilities or past performance) are permitted, and the award is made based on the lowest price technically acceptable proposal submitted to the government. Non- cost factors are rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis. By contrast, DOD may elect to use tradeoff procedures in acquisitions where the requirement is less definitive, more development work is required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these instances, non-cost factors may play a dominant role in the source selection process. Tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors allow DOD to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The FAR requires DOD to state in the solicitation whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price. DOD’s March 2016 Source Selection guide offers additional guidance regarding the use of LPTA source selection procedures. The guidance is mandatory for acquisitions conducted as part of a major system acquisition program and all competitive FAR part 15 procurements with an estimated value over $10 million. The guidance states that LPTA procedures may be used in situations where there would not be any value on a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. The guidance also states that such situations may include acquisitions for well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services and where risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, and when it has been determined there would be no need or value to pay more for higher performance. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 NDAA required that DOD revise the DFARS to require that LPTA procedures only be used in situations when the following six criteria are met. 1. DOD can clearly describe the minimum requirements in terms of performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to determine acceptability of offers; 2. DOD would realize no, or little, value from a proposal exceeding the solicitation’s minimum technical requirements; 3. The proposed technical approaches can be evaluated with little or no subjectivity as to the desirability of one versus the other; 4. There is a high degree of certainty that a review of technical proposals other than that of the lowest-price offeror would not identity factors that could provide other benefits to the government; 5. The contracting officer has included a justification for the use of LPTA procedures in the contract file; and 6. The lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs, including for operations and support. Section 813 also established that implementing revisions to the DFARS were to be completed within 120 days of enactment of the NDAA, but the revisions had not been put in place as of October 2017. DOD officials stated that the changes to the DFARS are currently in progress. In 2010 and 2014, we reported on DOD’s use of best value tradeoff source selection procedures. In 2010, we found that, for 60 of the 88 contracts reviewed, DOD used a tradeoff process and weighted non-cost factors as more important than price. In these cases, DOD was willing to pay more when a firm demonstrated it understood complex technical issues more thoroughly, could provide a needed good or service to meet deadlines, or had a proven track record in successfully delivering products or services of a similar nature. In addition, we determined that when making tradeoff decisions, DOD selected a lower priced proposal nearly as often as it selected a higher technically rated, but more costly, proposal. In so doing, DOD chose not to pay more than $800 million in proposed costs by selecting a lower priced offer over a higher technically rated offer in 18 contracts. The majority of solicitations where non-cost factors were equal to or less important than cost were for less complex requirements. DOD faced several challenges when using best value tradeoff procedures, including: the difficulties in developing meaningful evaluation factors, the additional time investment needed to conduct best value procurements, and the greater level of business judgment required of acquisition staff when compared to other acquisition approaches. To help DOD effectively employ the best value tradeoff process, we recommended that DOD develop training elements such as case studies that focus on reaching tradeoff decisions. DOD concurred and implemented the recommendation in August 2012. In 2014, we found that DOD had increased its use of LPTA procedures for new contracts with obligations over $25 million—using LPTA source selection procedures to award an estimated 36 percent of new fiscal year 2013 contracts compared to 26 percent in fiscal year 2009—and that officials’ decisions on which source selection method would be used was generally rooted in knowledge about the requirements and contractors. For contracts with obligations over $25 million, DOD used LPTA source selection procedures primarily to acquire commercial products such as fuel, and we identified relatively few uses of LPTA to acquire higher dollar services. For contracts with obligations over $1 million and under $25 million, DOD used LPTA procedures an estimated 45 percent of the time for a mix of products and services, including fuel, aircraft parts, computer equipment, construction-related services, engineering support services, and ship maintenance and repairs. We did not make recommendations to DOD in this report. The Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used LPTA source selection procedures for IT and support services contracts valued at $10 million or more that were awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017. Our analysis found that the three military departments awarded 781 new contracts valued at $10 million or more during this time frame. Of these 781 contracts, 133 contracts were awarded for IT and support services. However, only 9 of the 133 contracts used LPTA source selection procedures (see fig. 2). Table 1 provides information on the 7 contracts we reviewed that were awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017 that used LPTA source selection procedures. As previously noted, we excluded 2 of the 9 contracts from further review due to bid protests. Contracting officials cited a number of factors that were considered when determining to use LPTA procedures in the 7 selected contracts we reviewed. For all of the contracts, officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. For these contracts, contracting officials also stated that LPTA procedures were used, in part, because the requirements were well- defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. Additional details on the contracts follow. The Army awarded an IDIQ contract, with a one-year base period and four 1-year options, for support services in Afghanistan with an estimated ceiling value of $85,000,000. This is a reoccurring requirement to hire Afghan nationals to provide on-site construction management, engineering, and technical support services for reconstruction projects throughout Afghanistan. The acquisition plan states that Afghan nationals can more freely move about the country compared to U.S. personnel. Further, a contracting official stated that it was determined that no additional value would be gained by paying a premium for these services and that the lowest price was the best choice. In addition, to mitigate risk of poor performance, one requirement of the contract is to maintain a qualified workforce. Officials stated that approximately 90 percent of personnel performing on the previous contract are working on the current contract. The Air Force awarded three contracts for base operation support services—vehicle maintenance, airfield maintenance, fuel management, and traffic management—at an Air Force Reserve Base and two Air Reserve Stations. All of the contracts were awarded with a one-month orientation period, one-year base period, four 1-year options, and a final 6-month option, with total estimated values ranging from $24.7 million to $38.2 million. Acquisition plans for these requirements stated that the services were well defined. Additionally, contracting officials stated that there is at least a decade of past experience with these requirements, and, as a result, the requirements are well known. The Air Force awarded a contract for centralized mail sorting services in Germany. The contract consists of a 2-month phase-in period, a 2- month base period, four 1-year options, and one 8-month option, with a total estimated value of approximately $21.5 million. The acquisition plan for this requirement stated that a LPTA source selection procedure was chosen because the requirement was well-defined and not technically complex. For example, the acquisition plan noted that there was more than a decade of historical data that helped define and estimate the volume of mail that would need to be sorted. Contracting officials reiterated that LPTA was used since the service was well-defined, the risk of poor performance was low, and that it was determined that additional trade-offs would not provide an additional benefit to the taxpayer. The Army awarded an IDIQ contract to look for vulnerabilities in software code. The contract, which was set aside for small businesses, had a 5-year ordering period and an estimated ceiling value of $17.1 million. The contractor was required to perform a software review using several government approved code analysis tools and then characterize any potential vulnerabilities identified by the tools in terms of risk levels prescribed by established government cybersecurity standards. Army requirements officials stated that they determined there was no additional value to be gained from additional innovations in doing either task. Our review found some indication that the requirement, however, might not have been clearly understood by offerors. For example, the Army received 12 offers which ranged from $800,177 to $46,680,003. The contracting officer attributed the range of offers to the inexperience of some offerors with preparing proposals or misunderstanding this type of requirement, and the two lowest offers were determined to be technically unacceptable. The Navy awarded a contract to perform commercially available monthly telephone maintenance, which includes preventive and remedial maintenance on a specific brand of phone systems that Navy locations in California use. The contract consists of a one-year base period and two 1-year options, with an estimated total value of approximately $15.9 million. The acquisition plan stated that only certified authorized dealers could perform maintenance on these phones. A contracting official stated the requirement was well-defined and required the highest tier of maintenance options that could be offered, and, as a result, there was no tradeoff available. The highest tier requires that maintenance be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in multiple Navy locations, and that the contractor must respond to emergencies within 15 minutes during normal business hours. The contract also includes maintenance for all switches, inside wiring and any necessary relocation services, among other support requirements. 1. One contracting official determined that minimum performance requirements for the $15.9 million contract for monthly telephone maintenance services could be described using objective performance measures, and the contract documents showed the technical acceptability of offers was tied to the description of these requirements in the statement of work. In another example, documents related to the award of a $27.9 million Air Force contract for base operations services show performance objectives and standards set forth as evaluation factors. procedures may be used only when DOD would realize little or no value from a proposal that exceeds the solicitation’s minimum technical requirements. Our interviews with contracting officials and review of contract documents found that in each case, DOD officials assessed whether the department could receive value from a contract awarded on a tradeoff basis where the proposal exceeded the minimum technical requirements, and determined that there would be no additional value to be gained. 3. Most officials said they felt that it was possible to evaluate the proposals they received with little subjectivity, although they had not always explicitly made and documented this assessment. Officials for two contracts stated, for example, that the threshold question of technical acceptability for their contracts was whether the offering firms possessed certain licenses or accreditation to perform services on specific equipment or in specific locations. No subjectivity was involved in this assessment; therefore, they viewed the question of technical acceptability as essentially objective. However, because they were not required to document this assessment, contract documents did not provide evidence of an assessment of subjectivity. 4. Officials for most of the contracts we reviewed stated they had determined that a review of technical proposals other than that of the lowest-price offeror would not identity factors that could provide other benefits. In one case officials ultimately reviewed additional proposals, which is allowed under current DOD source selection guidance. DOD’s March 2016 source selection guidance does not require contracting officers to consider the fifth and sixth criteria listed in Section 813. Accordingly, we found that contracting officers did not always document justifications for choosing LPTA procedures and did not determine that the lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs. Specifically, we found that: 5. Although the files for all 7 contracts contained some record of the choice of LPTA source selection procedures, files for 3 of the 7 contracts simply stated that LPTA procedures would be used and did not include an explanation or justification for the choice. Only the documents for the four Air Force contracts included some explanation of the reasons for choosing LPTA source selection procedures. While not required by DOD source selection guidance when our selected contracts were approaching source selection, providing a justification for using LPTA is one of the criteria that Section 813 requires DOD to include among the revisions to the DFARS. 6. None of the officials for our selected contracts had confirmed that the lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs, which is one of the criteria that Section 813 requires DOD to include among the revisions to the DFARS. For the mail delivery, telephone maintenance, and base operations support contracts we reviewed, two contracting officials noted that full life-cycle costs were not applicable and a third stated that life-cycle costs cannot be determined for a service contract. As previously noted, all of the contracts in our review were for services, not for products. A Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy official acknowledged that the application of the criterion could cause confusion and that DOD officials are considering this issue as part of efforts to revise the DFARS. As previously noted, DOD is currently developing the revisions to the DFARS that are contemplated by Section 813. DOD officials could not provide a specific timeframe for when the DFARS would be revised, noting that the revisions would need to be reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget, and then released for public comment before the revisions could be finalized. We are not making any recommendations in this report. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment. DOD had no comments on the draft report.

When awarding a contract competitively, DOD may use the LPTA source selection process to select the lowest-priced offer that is technically acceptable. In contrast, DOD may use the trade-off source selection process to award a higher-priced contract to a firm if the firm's offer provides greater benefit and it is worth paying the additional cost. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 calls on DOD to avoid using the LPTA process for information technology, cybersecurity, and other knowledge-based professional support services. The Act also included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's use of LPTA procedures for contracts valued at more than $10 million. This report assesses the (1) extent to which DOD used LPTA procedures for certain services, and (2) factors that contracting officials considered when deciding to use LPTA procedures. GAO reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation to identify 781 contracts valued at $10 million or above awarded by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the first half of fiscal year 2017, the most recent period for which data were available. GAO then selected 133 of these contracts for information technology and support services, which include services reflected in the Act. GAO identified that 9 contracts used LPTA procedures and reviewed 7 of these, including interviewing officials and reviewing contract documents. DOD had no comments on the draft report. During the first half of fiscal year 2017, the Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures when awarding contracts valued at $10 million or more for the types of services identified by the National Defense Authorization Act, such as information technology services. Department of Defense (DOD) guidance states that LPTA procedures are typically for requirements that are well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services with a minimal risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The figure shows the military departments' limited use of LPTA procedures for contracts for selected services. For the 7 contracts that GAO reviewed, contracting officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. Contracting officials also stated that LPTA was used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For example, the Navy used LPTA procedures to award a contract for commercially available monthly telephone maintenance services. In addition, the Air Force used LPTA procedures to award a contract for mail sorting and delivery. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to amend its regulations to require contracting officers to consider specific criteria when deciding to use LPTA procedures. DOD has not yet revised its regulations to implement Section 813. Nevertheless, for the 7 contracts GAO reviewed, contracting officials' considerations when choosing to use LPTA procedures were often consistent with most of these new criteria. DOD officials are currently developing the revisions to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement that are contemplated by Section 813."], "length": 3187, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ba31b3f52529bcbe88526d39a80a7160c949efc3e3419dab"}
{"input": "", "context": "World Bank President Jim Yong Kim recently announced that he was stepping down in February 2019 to join Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity fund that invests in projects in advanced and developing countries. Kim's unexpected resignation, combined with his joining of a private firm that could directly compete with the World Bank for investments, raises questions for policymakers as they nominate and select a new president for the World Bank, a central component of the U.S.-led international economic order for the past eight decades. According to an informal agreement among their member countries, the U.S. nominee is chosen as the World Bank president and a European candidate (typically French or German) is appointed as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This custom has been subject to increasing criticism during the past two decades. The first line of criticism is directed at the current distribution of voting power, which critics contend does not account for the increasing integration of developing countries into the global economy. A second line of criticism is directed at the method of selecting World Bank and IMF leadership, which critics argue, elevates nationality above merit and undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of the institutions. This report provides information on the 2019 World Bank selection process and discusses efforts to reform the selection process. The World Bank is a multilateral development bank (MDB) that offers loans and grants to low- and middle-income countries to promote poverty alleviation and economic development. The World Bank has near-universal membership, with 189 member nations. U.S. membership in the World Bank is authorized by a federal statute known as the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 286 et seq .). Only Cuba and North Korea, and a few microstates such as the Vatican, Monaco, and Andorra, are nonmembers. Two of the Bank's five facilities, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA), lend directly to governments to finance development projects and policy programs in member countries. The IBRD provides middle-income developing countries with loans at near-market rates using funds raised by the World Bank on international capital markets. IDA was established in 1960 due to concerns that low-income countries could not afford to borrow at the near-market rate terms offered by the IBRD. IDA provides grants and concessional loans funded by contributions from donors and transfers from the IBRD to low-income countries. A country's eligibility for IBRD or IDA financial assistance depends on its relative poverty, defined as gross national income (GNI). For 2019, countries with a per capita GNI below $1,145 are eligible for IDA funding. IBRD commitments totaled $23.6 billion in 2018. Commitments from IDA to low-income countries were $24 billion in 2018 ( Table 1 ). Three other World Bank-affiliated organizations are dedicated to promoting private sector finance and investment in low-income countries. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) promotes private sector development in developing countries by making loans and investments in small- and medium-sized companies in those countries. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provides private investors with insurance coverage against noncommercial risk (expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and/or breach of contract) in developing countries. The International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) provides dispute resolution for investment disputes between governments and foreign investors. The United States is the largest contributor to the World Bank, having the largest share of the IBRD's subscribed capital, $46.4 billion (16.88%) of a total of $275 billion. As the largest contributor, the United States holds a single seat on the 25-member Board of Executive Directors and carries 16.32% of the total votes in Bank decisionmaking, which provides veto power on decisions requiring an 85% majority vote. The largest shareholders after the United States are Japan (6.89% of voting power), China (4.45%), Germany (4.03%), France (3.78%), and the United Kingdom (3.78%). The large voting power of the United States ensures the U.S. ability to veto major policy decisions at the Bank. A citizen of the United States has always held the presidency of the World Bank. The World Bank's president is chairman of the Board and elected by the Board of Directors. The president is the chief of the operating staff of the Bank and conducts, under direction of the executive directors, the ordinary business of the Bank. The Bank's 12 th president, Jim Yong Kim, has served since 2012. On September 27, 2016, Dr. Kim was reelected as the World Bank president, for a second five-year term beginning July 1, 2017. The Trump Administration has continued to support U.S. participation in the international financial institutions (IFIs) and has funded recent U.S. MDB commitments. The Trump Administration is supporting a $60.1 billion capital increase for the World Bank's main lending facility, the IBRD, which would raise its capital from $268.9 billion to $329 billion. World Bank members also endorsed a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC, which would more than triple the IFC's capital base from $2.57 billion to $8.2 billion. The Trump Administration supports the capital increase, which is to be accompanied by reforms designed, in part, to address a long-standing concern for many U.S. policymakers: high levels of World Bank lending to upper-middle income countries, especially China. In a statement at the 2017 IMF and World Bank spring meetings, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that, \"the relationship between the World Bank and more creditworthy countries [such as China] should mature over time, with the absolute level of borrowing declining as countries become better able to finance their own development objectives.\" Selecting the leadership at the two major international financial institutions—the IMF and the World Bank—is guided by a tradition that the World Bank president is an American and that the IMF managing director is a European. The informal agreement reflects the political and economic balance of power at the end of World War II. At the time, the United States believed that the World Bank should be headed by an American since the United States was the only capital surplus nation, and World Bank lending would be dependent on American financial markets. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Fred Vinson, believed that if an American representative headed the World Bank, the IMF must be headed by a non-American. Moreover, he noted, \"it would be impracticable to appoint U.S. citizens to head both the Bank and the Fund.\" Despite the growth of world capital markets, and the fact that the World Bank is no longer reliant on U.S. capital markets, the convention on the IMF and World Bank selection has remained intact. The U.S.-EU agreement is not unique. A 2009 study finds that Informal agreements allocating positions of authority and decision making pervade international organizations. Whether in secretariats or political, judicial, and administrative bodies, tacit understandings that assign representation to certain states or groups of states are the norm, not the exception... The Articles of Agreement of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) each specify that only citizens of regional countries may serve as presidents of those banks. By tradition, the Japanese Finance Ministry nominates a Japanese citizen to be president of the AsDB. The Articles of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) specify only that their president must come from a member country. By tradition, the IDB president is selected by a competitive process from among citizens of the Latin American countries. The EBRD president is also elected by a presumably competitive process, though only French and German citizens have served to date in that capacity and there is normally only one nominee. Second-tier offices in these institutions have also traditionally been reserved for U.S. citizens. First deputy managing director at the IMF and executive vice president at the IDB are traditionally U.S. citizens. These individuals are appointed by the chief executive of the institution, but in the case of the IMF and IDB an individual is typically designated by the U.S. Government. At the Asian Development Bank and EBRD, one of the vice presidents for an operational region has typically been a U.S. citizen. However, despite these restrictions, there have been successful efforts to open up the selection process across the MDBs. In 2015, the AfDB members elected Akinwumi Adesina of Nigeria, after a transparent election involving seven other candidates. Adesina garnered 58% of the total vote of AfDB shareholders. The 2012 World Bank election was the first to include several candidates and Kim's nomination was, unlike past nominations, not unanimous. The announcement of Kim's selection noted that a new selection process (introduced in 2011) yielded multiple nominees (former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and former Colombian Finance Minister and United Nations Under Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Jose Antonio Ocampo) and that the nominees received support from different member countries. The formal guidelines for choosing the World Bank president are laid out in the Bank's Articles of Agreements and Bylaws. Article V, Section 5, states that \"[t]he Executive Board shall select a President who shall not be a Governor or an Executive Director. \" This decision may be reached by a simple majority of the Executive Board. Section 13(c) of the Bank's bylaws stipulates the terms of service. World Bank presidents are elected for renewable five-year terms. Neither the articles nor the bylaws articulate any specific qualifications for the position of president of the World Bank. The Bank's Articles of Agreement, however, are silent on any requirements on how individuals are selected, on what criteria, or by what process they are vetted. There is no formal search process for candidates. Nominations can only be made by the 25 World Bank executive directors and there is no concerted search process of the Executive Board to identify and vet possible candidates. In 2000, two internal working groups (the World Bank Working Group to Review the Process for Selection of the President and the International Monetary Fund Working Group to Review the Process for Selection of the Managing Director) were created to discuss the selection procedure. A joint draft report of the working groups was endorsed by the executive directors on April 26, 2001, but never formally implemented. The report declared, among other things, that transparency and accountability are critical to the selection process. Instead of implementing the 2001 report's recommendations, the Executive Board adopted in 2011 a procedure that specified qualification criteria, established a nomination period, and provided for an interview process. Critics point out that the agreed procedures remain vague and largely nontransparent. Most notably, development expertise is not included as a qualification and the decision will be taken not by public vote, but rather by consensus according to prior practice. Declaring the importance of an \"open, transparent, and merit-based\" process, yet continuing to perpetuate the status quo, according to three former World Bank chief economists, is hypocritical, and \"destroys the trust and spirit of collaboration needed to manage the profound problems facing the world.\" The decision to select a new World Bank president is to be made by a majority vote of the World Bank's Executive Board. Unlike the United Nations General Assembly, which relies on a one-person, one-vote governance system, the World Bank uses a weighted voted system. Voting is loosely based on contributions to the Bank. The five largest shareholders (United States, Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom) have their own seat on the Executive Board. In addition to the five largest shareholders, China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have enough votes to elect their own executive directors. All other countries have gravitated into mixed-state groupings or constituencies. These constituencies range in size from 3 countries (South Africa, Angola, and Nigeria) to 21. The mixed-state constituencies are flexible in their membership. Countries have periodically switched constituencies, often to a new group that will allow them to have a bigger vote or leadership role. Unlike the eight countries that have their own ED, the influence of countries in mixed-state constituencies is not equivalent to their quota-determined voting weight. Since they vote in constituencies, small countries can easily be sidestepped by the larger countries in the constituency. For many countries at the World Bank, they \"can at best express a divergent opinion orally but cannot bring it to bear in the form of a vote.\" Executive directors must cast their votes as single unit, even though some of the countries they represent may disagree with their position. There is no provision for splitting a constituency's vote. There is no formal congressional involvement in the selection of Bank management. U.S. participation in the World Bank is authorized by the Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1945. The act delegates to the President ultimate authority under U.S. law to direct U.S. policy and instruct the U.S. representatives at the Bank. The President, in turn, has generally delegated authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. With the advice and consent of the Senate, the President names individuals to represent the United States on the Executive Board of the World Bank. The position of U.S. executive director is currently vacant. The alternate executive director is Erik Bethel. The Executive Board has authority over operations and policy and must approve any loan or policy decision. The U.S. executive director is supported primarily by Treasury Department staff. Unique among the founding members, the Bretton Woods Agreement Act requires specific congressional authorization for certain decisions, such as changing the U.S. share at the Bank or amending the Articles of Agreement. However, neither the approval of individual loans nor the selection of the managing director requires congressional approval. The European-U.S. arrangement to split the leadership at the IMF and World Bank has generated controversy, which may undermine the effectiveness of the eventual nominee. Critics of the current selection process make two general arguments. First, the gentlemen's agreement on IMF and World Bank leadership is seen as a relic of a global economy that no longer exists. Whereas the United States and Europe dominated the postwar economy, the current international economy is more diverse. Developing and emerging market countries contribute half of global output, up from 25% 30 years ago. Over the past several decades, the balance of global economic power has been shifting from the United States and Europe to China and a number of other fast-developing countries ( Figure 1 ). These economies account for rising shares of global GDP, manufacturing, and trade, and also are driven by a significant expansion of trade among the developing countries (South-South trade). These shifts are driven by growing economic integration and interdependence among economies, particularly through new global production and supply chains that incorporate inputs from many different countries. In recent years, China has also invested in, created, and led a range of institutions and initiatives, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and other funding mechanisms, such as the Silk Road Fund and the New Development Bank (also known as the BRICS Bank), a collective arrangement with Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa. At the same time, China is pursuing its own bilateral and regional trade agreements, such as the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with 15 other countries in the Asia Pacific. China has also positioned itself to act as a lender of last resort through monetary arrangements such as the BRICs Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) and the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM). In such a diverse global economy, any agreement that grants the leadership position based on nationality, critics argue, unnecessarily limits the pool of potential candidates that may be exceptionally competent in addressing the issues before the Bank. \"Since the creation of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank at the end of the second world war, an American has led the Bank and a European the IMF,\" noted Mark Sobel, U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), an independent think tank, and former U.S. representative at the IMF. \"It is time for a change.\" According to Nancy Birdsall, senior fellow and founding president of the Center for Global Development, \"the logic of an American president to ensure sustained U.S. support for the World Bank is no longer as clear as it has been.\" According to Birdsall, and others, the Trump Administration's \"America First\" rhetoric may make it harder for the United States to coalesce support for the U.S. candidate. Others argue that these concerns are overblown and that any serious effort to block the U.S. nominee would backfire. David Dollar, a former U.S. Treasury and senior World Bank official, says that, \"it's a very complicated game. My instinct is that there is a very strong likelihood that the U.S. nominee will be approved. The world has an interest in the United States staying engaged with the World Bank.\" Devesh Kapur, a professor at Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, puts it more bluntly, saying \"powerful nations' relationships with the United States matter much more than who heads the World Bank.\" Following Kim's announcement of his resignation, the Bank's Executive Board met on January 9, 2019, and issued a formal statement on the selection process. The nomination period for the next president ends on March 14, after which the Executive Board is to decide on a shortlist of three candidates. Following interviews, the Executive Board aims to select the next president before the spring meetings in April 2019. On February 6, President Trump nominated David Malpass, Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs, to be the next World Bank president. Reportedly, Ivanka Trump, President Trump's oldest daughter and senior advisor, played a role in selecting the U.S. nominee. In 2017, Ms. Trump helped start a World Bank-administered fund, the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which aims to generate $1.6 billion in capital for female entrepreneurs. The White House, according to reports, also considered Indra Nooyi, the former chief executive officer of PepsiCo; Ray Washburne, President and Chief Executive of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; Mark Green, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator; and Robert Kimmitt, Deputy Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush.", "answers": ["On January 7, 2018, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim announced that he would resign by February 1, three years before the expiration of his second five-year term in 2022. Following his resignation, Dr. Kim is to join Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a private equity fund that invests in projects in advanced and developing countries. Prior to his nomination to the World Bank by President Barack Obama in 2012, Dr. Kim served as the president of Dartmouth College. The nomination period for the next president ends on March 14, after which the Executive Board is to select three candidates for interviews. To date, the only candidate is David Malpass, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for International Affairs, nominated by President Trump on February 6, 2019. Following the interviews, the Executive Board is to select the next president, something which it aims to do before the spring meetings in April 2019. Since its founding after World War II, the presidency of the World Bank has been held by a citizen of the United States, the Bank's largest shareholder. According to an informal agreement among World Bank member countries, a U.S. candidate is chosen as the president of the World Bank and a European candidate (typically French or German) is appointed as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The formal requirement for the selection of the World Bank president is that the executive directors appoint, by at least a 50% majority, an individual who is neither a member of the Board of Governors nor Board of Executive Directors. There are no requirements on how individuals are selected, on what criteria, or by what process they are vetted. Although the executive directors may select the IMF managing director by a simple majority vote, they historically aim to reach agreement by consensus. With these factors combined, the custom guaranteeing European leadership at the IMF and American leadership at the World Bank has remained in place. This custom has been subject to increasing criticism during the past two decades. The first line of criticism is directed at the current distribution of voting power, which critics contend does not account for the increasing integration of developing countries into the global economy. A second line of criticism is directed at the method of selecting World Bank and IMF leadership, which critics argue elevates nationality above merit and undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of the institutions. Calls for a more open, transparent, and merit-based leadership selection process have been made consistently in the past, and at times have been incorporated into communiqués of various summits, but have yet to change the leadership selection process at either institution."], "length": 3445, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "dd75bb805b5fc457bdab49c32635ed8024f47048416ab1fe"}
{"input": "", "context": "T he Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Treasury (Title I), the Executive Office of the President (EOP; Title II), the judiciary (Title III), the District of Columbia (Title IV), and more than two dozen independent agencies (Title V). The bill typically funds mandatory retirement accounts in Title VI, which also contains additional general provisions applying to the funding provided to agencies through the FSGG bill. Title VII typically contains general provisions applying government-wide. The FSGG bill has also often contained provisions relating to the U.S. policy toward Cuba. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with one exception. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. Where the CFTC is funded upon enactment depends on which chamber originated the law, which typically alternates annually. Thus, the enacted amounts for the CFTC typically are in the Agriculture appropriations bill one year and FSGG the following year. This structure has existed in its current form since the 2007 reorganization of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Although financial services are a major focus of the bill, the FSGG appropriations bill does not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are instead funded outside of the appropriations process. It is not uncommon for legislative provisions addressing various financial regulatory issues to be included in titles at the end of the bill. President Trump submitted his FY2019 budget request on February 12, 2018. The request included a total of $49.1 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $282 million for the CFTC. This total included a proposed legislative provision on government-wide transfer authority in Section 737, which was estimated at $3 billion by the appropriations committees. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 ( H.R. 6258 , H.Rept. 115-792 ) on June 15, 2018. Total FY2019 funding in the reported bill would have beeen $45.7 billion, with another $255 million for the CFTC included in the Agriculture appropriations bill ( H.R. 5961 , H.Rept. 115-706 ). The combined total of $45.9 billion would have been about $3.2 billion below the President's FY2019 request, with the largest differences in the funding for the General Services Administration (GSA) and in language relating to government-wide transfers that was requested by the President but not included in the legislation (Section 737). H.R. 6258 was included as Division B of H.R. 6147 , the Interior appropriations bill, when it was considered by the House of Representatives beginning on July 17, 2018. The bill was amended numerous times, shifting funding among FSGG agencies but not changing the FSGG totals. H.R. 6147 passed the House on July 19, 2018. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 ( S. 3107 , S.Rept. 115-281 ) on June 28, 2018. Funding in S. 3107 totaled $45.9 billion, about $3.2 billion below the President's FY2019 request, with the largest differences in the funding for the GSA and in the government-wide transfers requested language (Section 737). The Senate began floor consideration of H.R. 6147 on July 24, 2018, including the text of S. 3107 as Division B of the amendment in the nature of a substitute ( S.Amdt. 3399 ). The amendment also included three other appropriations bills. The amended version of H.R. 6147 was passed by the Senate on August 1, 2018. The conference committee on H.R. 6147 convened on September 13, 2018. No conference report was reported, however, prior to the end of the fiscal year. Instead, Division C of P.L. 115-245 , enacted on September 28, 2018, generally provided for continuing appropriations at FY2018 levels for the FSGG agencies through December 7, 2018. A further continuing resolution ( P.L. 115-298 ) was passed providing funding through December 21, 2018. No additional appropriations were passed in the 115 th Congress, leading to a funding lapse for the FSGG agencies as well as those funded in six other appropriations bills beginning on December 22, 2018. The House of Representatives passed two consolidated appropriations bills in January 2019. H.R. 21 —which contained six full FY2019 appropriations bills, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to those passed by the Senate in the 115 th Congress—passed on January 3, 2019. H.R. 21 would have provided a total of $45.9 billion for the FSGG agencies, with the CFTC funding included with FSGG funding in Division B, following the Senate structure. On January 23, 2019, the House passed H.R. 648 , also containing the same six full FY2019 appropriations bills, which was reportedly based on a potential conference report from the 115 th Congress. H.R. 648 would have provided $46.0 billion for the FSGG agencies, with the FSGG portion—including CFTC funding—in Division C. Neither of these bills included the financial regulatory provisions in Title IX of the House-passed bill in the 115 th Congress. The Senate did not act on either of these bills. On February 14, 2019, the House and the Senate agreed to a conference report ( H.Rept. 116-9 ) on H.J.Res 31 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, containing seven appropriations bills. This act provides full FY2019 funding for the government's operations that had not been previously funded, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to H.R. 648 , but located in Division D. The primary substantive differences were in the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund and in funding for GSA. The President signed the resolution on February 15, 2019, enacting it into law as P.L. 116-6 . P.L. 116-6 included $45.7 billion in FSGG funding, including the CFTC. It did not include the Title IX financial regulatory provisions passed by the House in the 115 th Congress. The final total was approximately $3.4 billion less than the President's request, with most of the difference coming from the Section 737 transfer authority, which was not included by Congress. Other notable differences included the funding for the GSA and the Executive Office of the President. Table 1 below reflects the status of FSGG appropriations measures at key points in the appropriations process across the 115 th and 116 th Congresses. Table 2 lists the broad amounts requested by the President and included in the various FSGG bills, largely by title, and Table 3 details the amounts for the independent agencies. Specific columns in Table 2 and Table 3 are FSGG agencies' enacted amounts for FY2018, the President's FY2019 request, the FY2019 amounts from the 115 th Congress bills ( H.R. 6147 as passed by the House and H.R. 6147 as passed by the Senate), the FY2019 amounts from the 116 th Congress House-passed bills ( H.R. 21 and H.R. 648 ), and the final FY2019 enacted amounts from P.L. 116-6 . Although financial services are a focus of the FSGG bill, the bill does not actually include funding for the regulation of much of the financial services industry. Financial services as an industry is often subdivided into banking, insurance, and securities. Federal regulation of the banking industry is divided among the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (generally known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB). In addition, credit unions, which operate similarly to many banks, are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). None of these agencies receives its primary funding through the appropriations process, with only the FDIC inspector general and a small NCUA-operated program currently funded in the FSGG bill. Insurance is generally regulated at the state level, with some Federal Reserve oversight at the holding company level. There is a relatively small Federal Insurance Office (FIO) inside the Treasury, which is funded through the Departmental Offices account, but FIO has no regulatory authority. Federal securities regulation is divided between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC, both of which are funded through appropriations. The CFTC funding is a relatively straightforward appropriation from the general fund, whereas the SEC funding is provided by the FSGG bill, but then offset through fees collected by the SEC. Although funding for many financial regulatory agencies may not be provided by the FSGG bill, legislative provisions affecting financial regulation in general and some of these agencies specifically have often been included in FSGG bills. In the 115 th Congress, H.R. 6258 and H.R. 6147 as passed by the House included many provisions, particularly in Title IX, that would have amended the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes relating to the regulation of financial institutions and the authority and funding of financial regulators. Many of these provisions were included in other legislation, notably H.R. 10 , which passed the House on June 8, 2017, and S. 488 as amended by the House, which passed the House on July 17, 2018, though neither of these bills were enacted in the 115 th Congress. Of particular interest from the appropriations perspective, H.R. 6258 and H.R. 6147 as passed by the House would have brought the CFPB under the FSGG bill instead of receiving funding from outside of the appropriations process, as is currently the case. S. 3107 and H.R. 6147 as passed by the Senate did not include similar provisions affecting the CFPB or other aspects of financial regulation as in Title IX of the House bills. In the 116 th Congress, the bills passed by the House ( H.R. 21 and H.R. 648 ) did not include financial regulatory provisions similar to those in the 115 th Congress House-passed bill, and neither did the enacted P.L. 116-6 . The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures in early 2007. Each chamber created a new Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. In the House, the FSGG Subcommittee's jurisdiction is primarily composed of agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies, commonly referred to as TTHUD. In addition, the House FSGG Subcommittee was assigned four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Subcommittee: the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the SEC, and the Small Business Administration (SBA). In the Senate, the new FSGG Subcommittee's jurisdiction is a combination of agencies from the jurisdiction of three previously existing subcommittees. Most of the agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee were assigned to the FSGG subcommittee. In addition, the District of Columbia, which had its own subcommittee in the 109 th Congress, was placed under the purview of the FSGG Subcommittee, as were four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee: the FCC, FTC, SEC, and SBA. As a result of this reorganization, the House and Senate FSGG Subcommittees have nearly identical jurisdictions, except that the CFTC is under the jurisdiction of the FSGG Subcommittee in the Senate and the Agriculture Subcommittee in the House. Table 4 below lists various departments and agencies funded through FSGG appropriations and the CRS experts' names pertaining to these departments and agencies.", "answers": ["The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the judiciary, the District of Columbia, and more than two dozen independent agencies. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with one exception. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is usually funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. President Trump submitted his FY2019 budget request on February 12, 2018. The request included a total of $49.1 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $282 million for the CFTC. The $49.1 billion figure includes $3 billion for a legislative provision on government-wide transfers (Section 737). The 115th Congress House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reported FSGG appropriations bills (H.R. 6258, H.Rept. 115-792 and S. 3107, S.Rept. 115-281) and both houses passed different versions of a broader bill (H.R. 6147) that would have provided FY2019 appropriations. The House-passed H.R. 6147 would have provided a combined total of $45.9 billion for the FSGG agencies, while the Senate-passed H.R. 6147 would have provided $45.7 billion. In both cases, the largest differences compared to the President's request were in the funding for the General Services Administration (GSA), the funding for the Executive Office of the President, and the absence of the Section 737 provision on government-wide transfers in both bills. No full-year FY2019 FSGG bill was enacted prior to the end of FY2018. The FSGG agencies were provided continuing appropriations until December 7, 2018, in P.L. 115-245 and until December 21, 2018, in P.L. 115-298. No final bill was enacted, and funding for FSGG agencies, along with much of the rest of the government, lapsed on December 22, 2018. No further appropriations occurred prior to the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 21, which contained six full FY2019 appropriations bills, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to those passed by the Senate in the 115th Congress on January 3, 2019. On January 23, 2019, the House passed H.R. 648, also containing six appropriations bills, which was reportedly based on a potential conference report from the 115th Congress and would have provided $46.0 billion for FSGG appropriations. (Neither of these bills provided full-year funding for the Department of Homeland Security.) The Senate did not act on either of these bills. On February 14, 2019, both the House and the Senate passed a conference report (H.Rept. 116-9) for H.J.Res. 31, containing seven appropriations bills providing full FY2019 funding for the government's operations that had not been previously funded, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to H.R. 648. The President signed the resolution on February 15, 2019, enacting it into law as P.L. 116-6. The law provides $45.7 billion in the FSGG appropriations portion (Division D), which includes the funding for the CFTC. This is $3.4 billion less than the President's request, with the bulk of this due to the absence of the Section 737 transfer authority in P.L. 116-6. Other notable differences include the funding for GSA and the Executive Office of the President. Although financial services are a major focus of the FSGG appropriations bills, these bills do not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are funded outside of the appropriations process. The FSGG bills have, however, often contained additional legislative provisions relating to such agencies, as is the case with H.R. 6258/H.R. 6147 in the 115th Congress, whose Title IX contained language from a number of different bills relating to financial regulation. P.L. 116-6 did not contain this language."], "length": 2490, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1a7bf80c730cbafed9c6b9467d47cc81282d37cf2536e99d"}

{"input": "", "context": "Both the Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101 st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" Use of the Capitol Grounds requires either the passage of a concurrent resolution or permit approval from the Capitol Police. Events that entail the use of the West Front Steps of the Capitol, electricity on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, require more than 24 hours from setup to cleanup, require vehicles on Capitol Grounds for setup, or will have a large number of Members in attendance typically require a concurrent resolution. All other events can typically be issued permits by the U.S. Capitol Police. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110 th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. Additionally, Congress has provided an ongoing authorization for holiday concerts on Capitol Grounds. Held on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day, these concerts feature the National Symphony Orchestra and are free and open to the public. A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 101 st through the 115 th Congresses (1989-2018). The search was conducted by running a query across all agreed-to concurrent resolutions using the subject term \"rotunda.\" The results of the search were then examined individually to differentiate resolutions for the use of the Rotunda from references to it in otherwise unrelated legislation. The search identified a total of 99 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 101 st Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between one and nine concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of the Rotunda. Table 1 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress. Appendix A , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category and examples of activities. Table 2 contains the number of concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress since 1989, by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions (34.3%) authorized the use of the Rotunda for a commemoration ceremony, often of an historical event. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda for a ceremony as part of the commemoration of the days of remembrance of victims of the Holocaust were passed during each Congress. In recent Congresses, resolutions were also agreed to for Rotunda ceremonies to commemorate the 60 th anniversary of the integration of the U.S. Armed Forces, the 200 th birthday of Constantino Brumidi, the 50 th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's inauguration, and the 50 th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Ceremonies to award Congressional Gold Medals account for 24.2% of the concurrent resolutions for the use of the Rotunda agreed to since the 101 st Congress. These award ceremonies include presentations of Congressional Gold Medals to Rosa Parks, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, the Tuskegee Airmen, and other recipients. Since the 101 st Congress, 15.2% of concurrent resolutions have been agreed to for the use of the Rotunda for ceremonies to unveil artwork. These have included unveiling ceremonies for portrait busts of former Vice Presidents, as well as presentation ceremonies of statues prior to placement in Statuary Hall. In preparation for the quadrennial Presidential inauguration activities that take place at the Capitol, concurrent resolutions were passed during the 102 nd , 104 th , 106 th , 108 th , 110 th , 112 th , 113 th , and 115 th Congresses. These resolutions have authorized the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to use the Rotunda \"in connection with the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President-elect and the Vice President-elect of the United States.\" Since the 101 st Congress, 10.1% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for inaugural activities. Since the 101 st Congress, 6.1% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for the purposes of receiving foreign dignitaries or honoring a living person. For example, during the 102 nd Congress, use of the Rotunda was authorized for a ceremony and reception for the Dalai Lama. During the 105 th Congress, use of the Rotunda was authorized for a ceremony honoring Mother Teresa. During the 114 th Congress, the use of the Rotunda was authorized for events surrounding the visit by His Holiness Pope Francis to address a joint session of Congress. Use of the Rotunda for individuals to lie in state or honor accounted for 8.1% of Rotunda events authorized by concurrent resolution. These events have included President Reagan, Senator Claude Pepper, and Senator Daniel K. Inouye lying in state; Rosa Parks lying in honor; and the memorial service for Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut of the U.S. Capitol Police. In the 115 th Congress, one individual—Reverend Billy Graham—lay in honor, while two—Senator John McCain and President George H.W. Bush—lay in state. On two occasions during the 107 th Congress (2.0%), concurrent resolutions were agreed to for the use of the Rotunda for prayer vigils. H.Con.Res. 233 authorized the use of the Rotunda for a prayer vigil in memory of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. S.Con.Res. 83 authorized the use of the Rotunda for a ceremony as part of a National Day of Reconciliation. A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 101 st to the 115 th Congresses (1989-2019). The search was conducted by running a query using the subject term \"Capitol Grounds.\" The results of the search were then examined individually to differentiate resolutions for the use of the Capitol Grounds from references to it in otherwise unrelated legislation. The uses of the Capitol Grounds identified here are restricted to those authorized by concurrent resolution of the House and Senate. The search identified a total 112 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 101 st Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between 3 and 14 concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of the Capitol Grounds. Table 3 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress. Appendix B , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds can be divided into one of four categories: (1) events sponsored by nonfederal-government groups; (2) memorial services; (3) events sponsored by the federal government; and (4) award and dedication ceremonies. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category with examples of the types of activities concurrent resolutions provided for on the Capitol Grounds. Table 4 contains the number of concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress since 1989 by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions agreed to (65.5%) authorized events that are sponsored by nonfederal-government entities. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby and the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Relay are typically agreed to each Congress. Memorial services held on the Capitol Grounds account for 23% of the concurrent resolutions passed since the 101 st Congress. Each year since 1989, the House and Senate have agreed to a concurrent resolution allowing the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service to be conducted on Capitol Grounds. The ceremony honors law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty during the previous year. Events sponsored by the federal government compose 8.8% of events on the Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolution. These events have included authorizing the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to hold performances on the East Front of the Capitol, allowing the National Book Festival to run programs on the Capitol Grounds, and authorizing a celebration for the Library of Congress's 200 th birthday. Award and dedication ceremonies account for 2.7% of events authorized by concurrent resolution for the Capitol Grounds. Since 1989, three award and dedication ceremonies have been authorized through concurrent resolution. In the 106 th Congress (1999-2001), Congress authorized the use of the Capitol Grounds for the dedication of the Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism; in the 108 th Congress (2003-2005), the dedication ceremony for the National World War II Memorial was authorized for the Capitol Grounds; and in the 110 th Congress (2007-2009), the presentation ceremony for the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, took place on the Capitol Grounds. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110 th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. The first concurrent resolution authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall was agreed to during the 110 th Congress. It provided for the use of the Hall in connection with \"ceremonies and activities held in connection with the opening of the Capitol Visitor Center to the public.\" Consistent with previous resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda, the concurrent resolution for the use of Emancipation Hall directed that physical preparations be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 110 th through the 115 th Congresses (2007-2017). The search was conducted by running a query using the subject term \"Emancipation Hall.\" The uses of Emancipation Hall identified here are restricted to those authorized by concurrent resolution of the House and Senate. The search identified a total 43 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 110 th Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between 1 and 15 concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of Emancipation Hall. Table 5 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress. Appendix C , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall can be divided into one of four categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies, (2) congressional gold medal ceremonies, (3) artwork unveilings, and (4) presidential inauguration activities. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category with examples of the types of activities concurrent resolutions provided for on Emancipation Hall. Table 6 contains the number of concurrent resolution agreed to by Congress since 2007 by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions agreed to (46.5%) authorized the use of Emancipation Hall for commemoration ceremonies. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall are agreed to annually to celebrate the birthday of King Kamehameha. Ceremonies to award Congressional Gold Medals account for 32.6% of the concurrent resolutions for the use of Emancipation Hall agreed to since the 110 th Congress. These award ceremonies include presentations of Congressional Gold Medals to Women Air Force Service Pilots, the Montford Point Marines, and Native American Code Talkers. Since the 110 th Congress, 11.6% of concurrent resolutions have been agreed to for the use of Emancipation Hall for ceremonies to unveil artwork. These have included unveiling ceremonies for a bust of Sojourner Truth, a marker acknowledging the role of slaves in building the Capitol, a statue of Frederick Douglass, and the American Prisoners of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) Chair of Honor. Since Emancipation Hall opened in the middle of the 110 th Congress, Congress has also utilized the space for inaugural activities. Just like the resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda for inaugural activities, these resolutions have authorized the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to use Emancipation Hall \"in connection with the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President-elect and the Vice President-elect of the United States.\" Since the 110 th Congress, 9.3% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for inaugural activities.

Concurrent Resolutions Agreed to for the Use of Emancipation Hall", "answers": ["The Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out under the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol. Ninety-nine concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Rotunda between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. Use of the Capitol Grounds can be authorized either by the passage of a concurrent resolution or through an application process with the Capitol Police. A concurrent resolution is typically needed for events longer than 24 hours in duration, for events that require vehicles on the Capitol Grounds for setup, for events requiring electronics on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, and for events where a large number of Members will be in attendance. The Capitol Police's special events office handles permits and approval for all other events. One hundred twelve concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into four categories: (1) events sponsored by nonfederal-government groups; (2) memorial services; (3) events sponsored by the federal government; and (4) award and dedication ceremonies.

{"input": "", "context": "DOD, through the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, develops department-wide strategic guidance based on direction from the President and issues this guidance through strategy documents. According to joint doctrine and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff guidance, combatant commanders use strategy documents as guidance for planning operations. Specifically, combatant commanders translate this guidance into their commands’ campaign and contingency plans. The military services organize, train, equip, and provide forces to the combatant commanders to execute command plans. The combatant commander must make certain the combatant command can execute these plans. PACOM is one of six geographic Unified Combatant Commands of the U.S. Armed Forces. With an area of responsibility extending from the waters off the west coast of the United States to the western border of India, and from Antarctica to the North Pole, PACOM is the primary U.S. military authority in the Pacific. In 2016, PACOM reported that approximately 380,000 U.S. military and civilian personnel were assigned to this area. PACOM describes the 36 nations that comprise the Asia- Pacific region as home to more than 50 percent of the world’s population and 3,000 different languages, several of the world’s larger militaries, and five nations allied with the United States through mutual defense treaties or agreements. PACOM’s commander reports to the President and the Secretary of Defense through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and is supported by four service component commands: U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Pacific Air Forces, U.S. Army Pacific, and U.S. Marine Forces, Pacific. In President Obama’s speech to the Australian Parliament in November 2011, he stated that after a decade of fighting two wars, the United States was turning its attention to the vast potential of the Asia-Pacific region. The President described the U.S. as a historic Pacific power whose interests are inextricably linked with Asia’s economic, security, and political order. According to a senior administration official, the United States planned to implement a comprehensive, multidimensional strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. PACOM used military strategy documents to implement presidential strategic direction to rebalance efforts to the Pacific. However, according to officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint Staff, and the U.S. Pacific Command there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, these officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific effort. Based on our interviews with U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) and DOD officials, we focused our review on six strategy documents, issued between 2012 and 2015, that these officials considered relevant and representative of DOD’s previous strategy to implement the rebalance to the Pacific through 2016. The six documents that we reviewed are: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense. DOD issued this document in January 2012. This publication reflected presidential strategic direction to DOD and described the key military missions for which the department would prepare. In describing the security environment, this strategic guidance stated that the United States would, of necessity, rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region. Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). According to DOD guidance, the QDR articulates a national defense strategy consistent with the broader government-wide National Security Strategy by defining force structure, modernization plans, and a budget plan allowing the military to successfully execute the full range of missions within that strategy. The 2014 QDR referred to the rebalance to the Pacific as a part of sustaining U.S. presence and posture abroad to better protect U.S. national security interests. National Military Strategy (NMS). The 2015 NMS described how DOD would employ military forces to protect and advance U.S. national interests. The NMS provided focus for military activities by defining a set of military objectives and concepts used by the combatant commanders and others. The 2015 NMS referenced the rebalance to the Pacific as part of a national military objective. The NMS was informed by the QDR. Guidance for the Employment of the Force (GEF). According to joint doctrine, the GEF provides direction to combatant commands for operational planning, force management, security cooperation, and posture planning. The GEF is the method through which the Secretary of Defense translates strategic priorities in the QDR and other strategy documents into direction for operational activities. The GEF is described in joint doctrine as an essential document for combatant command planners as it provides the strategic end states for the deliberate planning of campaign and contingency plans. Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The JSCP is the primary vehicle through which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff directs the preparation of joint plans. The JSCP provides military strategic and operational guidance to combatant commanders for the preparation of plans based on current military capabilities. The JSCP tasks combatant commanders to develop campaign, contingency, and posture plans and translates requirements from the GEF and other guidance into prioritized military missions, tasks, and plans. The JSCP is informed by the GEF and the NMS. PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) (TCP). Campaign plans, such as PACOM’s TCP, focus on the combatant command’s steady-state or daily activities and operationalize combatant command theater strategies. According to joint doctrine, joint planning draws from tasks identified in the GEF and JSCP and campaign plans should focus on the combatant command’s steady-state activities. These include ongoing operations, military engagement, security cooperation, deterrence, and other shaping or preventive activities. Campaign plans provide the vehicle for linking steady-state shaping activities to the attainment of strategic and military end states. In January 2018, DOD announced its new 2018 National Defense Strategy that cited as the department’s principal priorities the long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The strategy also stated that concurrently the department would sustain its efforts to deter and counter rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran, defeat terrorist threats to the United States, and consolidate gains in Iraq and Afghanistan while moving to a more resource-sustainable approach. In February 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs notified GAO that although DOD continues to prioritize the Asia-Pacific region, the rebalance to the Pacific is no longer U.S. policy. Six DOD strategy documents that helped guide the rebalance to the Pacific collectively included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. We have previously reported that effective national strategies incorporate six characteristics, and their associated desired elements. Table 1 lists desired elements that we adapted from our prior work and tailored toward our review of the six DOD strategy documents. We found these six DOD strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included, to varying degrees, 24 of the 31 desired elements we determined as being the most relevant to an effective strategy for the rebalance. For example, as a set, the six strategy documents contained a detailed description of the operating environment in which activities for the rebalance were to take place and included references that described the relationship of the rebalance to the Pacific to other strategies, goals, and objectives. The strategy documents referenced their purposes and, in unclassified and general descriptions, the threats that the strategies were to address including long-range missile threats and weapons of mass destruction. Collectively, the strategy documents referred to selected types of resources needed, such as the deployment of ships and aviation assets, and who would be implementing the strategies. We were, however, unable to find any reference to 7 of the 31 elements in any of the six strategy documents. For example, 2 of the 7 missing elements were: Lack of a documented, consistent definition of the rebalance to the Pacific. Based on our systematic review, we found that none of DOD’s six strategy documents issued from 2012 to 2015 included a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific that described the rebalance’s key terms, major functions, mission areas or activities. Further, DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint Staff, and the U.S. Pacific Command involved in planning and implementing the rebalance to the Pacific were unable to identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents, and consequently could not provide a definition that was in use consistently across the department. During discussions about the absence of a definition, these PACOM officials told us that all PACOM activities were rebalance activities, even activities that were underway before the President’s announcement to rebalance. Senior DOD policy officials referred us to the speeches of senior administration officials given since the President’s 2011 address to derive the definition of the rebalance. However, as noted earlier, after the President’s speech in 2011, there were a number of pronouncements from senior administration officials that varied over time. The lack of consistent attributes to a strategy can make it difficult for policy makers to assess its effectiveness and accountability. Lack of a documented end state for the rebalance to the Pacific. Based on our systematic review, we found that none of DOD’s six strategy documents from 2012 to 2015 identified an end state for the rebalance to the Pacific. Identifying the end state is a desired element associated with establishing goals and objectives for effective strategies and plans. Joint doctrine also states that military planners must know where to look for the guidance to ensure that plans are consistent with national priorities and are directed toward achieving national security goals and objectives. A national strategy that identified the end state of the rebalance could distinguish new efforts from the longstanding U.S. military presence in the region, and the associated increase in resources to support the post-2011 rebalancing. For example, we found a lack of clarity concerning the end state for the rebalance. DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Joint Staff, and PACOM—whom we interviewed because they were involved in planning and implementing the rebalance to the Pacific—said that they were unaware of an end state for DOD’s efforts to rebalance. The same officials told us that there was no foreseeable end state because, as long as the Asia-Pacific region was important to the U.S., the focus would remain on the region. However, officials from different military service components told us that their individual services had an end state for their service-specific activities to support the rebalance. For example, officials from U.S. Army Pacific told us that they had completed their service’s rebalance. They stated that they achieved the end state with the completion of force posture changes and that some efforts supporting rebalancing had begun before rebalancing was inaugurated. In contrast, a Marine Corps official in the Pacific reported there was no end state for rebalancing. According to the official, Marine Corps activities such as posture realignments supported rebalancing, but these longstanding activities were ongoing prior to the President’s announcement to rebalance. Moreover, we found a lack of an awareness of a command-wide end state for rebalancing and coordination among the various military service activities in support of rebalancing. It was unclear how service-defined end states could have been fully integrated or prioritized for funding without a consistent overall end state for DOD’s overall effort. In such instances, a department-wide defined end state could have helped with the allocation of resources because the most important priorities would be known. A clear and consistent definition for rebalance and the identification of an end state, as well as the inclusion of the other 5 missing elements, could have better positioned decision makers to effectively plan, manage, and assess DOD’s progress toward rebalancing efforts to the Pacific. According to DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy responsible for policy for the rebalance to the Pacific, the speeches by senior administration officials between 2012 and 2015 supplanted the need to identify and document a definition of the rebalance or an end state in a strategy document. However, as noted earlier, these statements included varying descriptions of the strategy and objectives over time. According to a DOD official from an office with department-wide performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative’s strategic objectives, or end state, were both important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a definition could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance to rebalance from those activities that were routine or peripheral to that effort. Further, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress toward a particular goal, and as described in joint doctrine, facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives. In moving forward in the Asia-Pacific region, considering the identification of strategic end states (one of the desired elements of an effective national strategy that is also discussed in joint doctrine) —as well as the other missing elements— could help position DOD to achieve its objectives in the region. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review. DOD had no comments. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the Secretaries of the military departments.

Contact points for our Office of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix II. To determine the extent to which the Department of Defense (DOD) has developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that include desired elements of an effective national strategy, we conducted a search of the literature, from January 2010 to July 2015, to identify official statements on, guidance for, and studies of DOD’s implementation of the rebalance to the Pacific. We reviewed department guidance, such as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instructions and joint publications, to understand DOD’s processes and procedures for developing and disseminating guidance and strategic plans. We also interviewed DOD officials from numerous organizations listed below who were involved with planning, providing guidance or implementing the rebalance to the Pacific to identify DOD’s rebalance efforts and whether a strategy or strategies existed that focused on or included the rebalance. The organizations contacted included: Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer, Deputy’s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities Director of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Cost Assessment U.S. Marines Corps Forces, Pacific U.S. Pacific Air Forces U.S. Transportation Command Based on these interviews and written responses to questions we submitted to the officials associated with these organizations, officials identified documentation and speeches that they indicated informed DOD organizations about implementing the rebalance. Also, based on this information, we found that there was not a single strategy or plan that provided guidance for or outlined DOD’s implementation of the rebalance to the Pacific. Instead, DOD officials from multiple offices identified a number of strategy documents that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including government-wide documents. Based on our interviews with U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) and DOD officials, we focused our review on the six selected strategy documents, issued between 2012 and 2015, that these officials considered relevant and representative of DOD’s previous strategy to implement the rebalance to the Pacific. Those six strategy documents are described earlier in the main report. We reviewed and analyzed these six strategy documents to determine whether, as a set, they included the 31 desired elements of the associated key characteristics of an effective national strategy. Our prior work on effective national strategies included examples of desired elements that we adapted and tailored toward our review of DOD strategy documents. We selected 31 desired elements as most relevant to DOD’s rebalance effort and for systematically reviewing DOD’s strategy documents associated with the rebalance. These elements and associated key characteristics are described in table 2 below. To determine whether as a set these strategy documents included the desired elements of an effective national strategy, we reviewed each strategy document using a scorecard method, using the following steps: First, we developed scorecards with a two-level scale of “address” and “did not address.” We used a binary scale of “address” or “did not address” and scored a passage as “address” if it included any part of an element description in order to provide the widest latitude in determining whether the selected passage included the specific element. Also, we used 31 desired elements from the six characteristics to make the comparison because these elements provided more specificity than the broad six characteristics. Second, analysts reviewed all of the selected passages from each strategy document and determined whether they were relevant to understanding the rebalance to the Pacific in order to reach agreement on which passages they would consider in the comparison to the desired elements. The readers agreed upon the inclusion and exclusion of passages before assessing whether these passages included the desired elements. Third, two analysts reviewed the relevant passages in each strategy document related to the rebalance and determined whether or not the passages included the element. The analysts used the scorecards to score each passage. Fourth, upon completion of the independent scoring process for each strategy document, the analysts compared their respective scores and reconciled any differences, thereby reaching a consensus on the final score. As needed, a third analyst facilitated reconciliations where there was a difference in the assessment reached by the individual analysts and documented the consensus results. Lastly, upon completion of scoring, the team compiled and summarized the results. To further corroborate our systematic review of the six strategy documents, we asked officials from DOD organizations responsible for the Asia-Pacific region a standard set of related questions. We asked officials these questions in order to obtain DOD’s perspective regarding the applicability of using the selected desired elements and associated key characteristics in reviewing these specific DOD strategy documents. We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to May 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Rebalancing to the Pacific became strategic guidance that informed military planning. By the end of 2015, DOD published strategy documents that included references to the rebalance to the Pacific or related concepts. In February 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs stated that while DOD continues to prioritize the Asia-Pacific region, the rebalance to the Pacific is no longer U.S. policy. DOD has published the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which establishes an objective of maintaining a favorable regional balance in the Pacific region, among other regions. Prior to the change in policy, House Report 114-102 included a provision for GAO to review matters related to the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that included desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO analyzed six DOD strategy documents that officials identified as providing guidance for the rebalance to the Pacific to determine whether, as a set, they included desired elements associated with an effective national strategy. DOD had no comments on this report. Department of Defense (DOD) strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. The U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), which is responsible for the Asia-Pacific region, used DOD strategy documents to implement the President's direction to rebalance to the Pacific, which generally refocused U.S. efforts to that region. PACOM officials told GAO that there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense ; Quadrennial Defense Review ; National Military Strategy ; Guidance for the Employment of the Force ; Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan ; and the PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) . Based on GAO's analysis, DOD's six strategy documents that guided the rebalance to the Pacific included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective national strategy. However, two key elements were missing from the group of strategy documents: (1) a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific, and (2) the identification of the overall results desired, or end state, for the rebalance. DOD officials also could not identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents or provide a definition that was used consistently across the department. According to a DOD official with performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative's strategic objectives, or end state, were important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a clear definition of rebalance could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance from activities that were peripheral to that effort. Similarly, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress, and facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives. In moving forward in the Asia-Pacific region, considering the identification of strategic end states as well as other missing elements could help position DOD to achieve its objectives in the region."], "length": 3841, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c70a7894fa37b1dd357d3d131a751abd235f4e813e0253c1"}
{"input": "", "context": "Our report noted that IRS has established organizational structures essential to supporting its taxpayer authentication efforts. Specifically, IRS created an Identity Assurance Office (IAO) in 2015 to work with stakeholders across IRS to review and assess the agency’s various authentication programs and efforts. In 2016, IAO led an effort that identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require authentication and categorized these interactions based on potential risks to the agency and taxpayers. Further, in December 2016, IAO released its Roadmap for developing a modern and secure authentication environment for all taxpayers regardless of how they interact with IRS— online, over the telephone, in person, or via correspondence. We also found that IRS is working to address its authentication challenges by collaborating with industry members and state partners via the Security Summit. The Security Summit was established in 2015 as an ongoing effort between industry experts from tax software companies, paid preparers, financial institutions, and states to improve information sharing and fraud detection and to address common IDT challenges. The Security Summit’s authentication workgroup leads several initiatives aimed at verifying the authenticity of the taxpayer and the tax return at the time of filing. One initiative involves analyzing data elements—such as trusted customer requirements and other characteristics of the return— that are collected during the tax return preparation and electronic filing process. In addition, in 2016 the authentication workgroup recommended improved account password standards to help protect taxpayers’ accounts from being taken over by criminals. Overall, we found that officials—representing IRS, industry, and states— expressed positive views about the level of commitment and cooperation guiding the group’s authentication efforts. Officials with whom we spoke stated that they are dedicated to continuing to address authentication issues collaboratively because they have a mutual interest in improving authentication to reduce tax refund fraud. In its Roadmap, IRS outlined six core authentication objectives, 10 high- level strategic efforts, and 14 foundational initiatives to help it address authentication challenges and identify opportunities for future investment. While we found that IRS has made progress on some efforts identified in its Roadmap, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. For example, one of IRS’s foundational initiatives is to send event-driven notifications to taxpayers, such as when they file a return or request a tax transcript. Such notifications could help IRS and taxpayers detect potentially fraudulent activity at the earliest stage and help improve authentication of tax returns. The Roadmap identifies seven supporting activities for this foundational initiative. One is to provide taxpayers with greater control over their online accounts. Another supporting activity is to determine methods for sending notifications to taxpayers about activity on their account. However, IRS has not identified the resources required to complete these activities, and the Roadmap notes that six of the seven activities will take between 6 months to 3 years to complete. In December 2017, IRS officials stated that they had developed business requirements for the foundational initiative to give taxpayers greater control over their online accounts. However, IRS has not identified funding for the initiative’s other supporting activities—such as developing requirements to send push notifications to taxpayers—and implementation will depend on the availability of future resources. In December 2017, IRS officials stated that each of the strategic efforts and foundational initiatives identified in the Roadmap are a high priority, and they are working to address them concurrently while balancing the availability of resources against the greatest threats to the tax environment. As noted in our report, we recognize that a strategy is necessarily high-level and that IRS must remain flexible and use available resources to respond to unexpected threats. Identifying resources and prioritizing activities in its Roadmap will help IRS clarify tradeoffs between costs, benefits, and risks and aid in decision making. Further, such efforts may also help IRS establish clearer timelines and better respond to unexpected events. As such, we recommended that IRS estimate the resources (i.e., financial and human) required for the foundational initiatives and supporting activities identified in its Roadmap and prioritize its foundational initiatives. IRS agreed with our recommendations and is currently working to finalize its overall authentication approach. Given the widespread availability of personally identifiable information that fraudsters can use to perpetrate tax fraud, it is essential for IRS to further strengthen taxpayer authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters’ schemes. In our report, we identified two additional areas that IRS must address to better position the agency and protect taxpayers against future threats. First, we found that IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement NIST’s June 2017 guidance for secure online authentication, however it had not yet established detailed plans, including timelines, milestone dates, and resource needs to fully implement it. Among other things, NIST’s new guidance directs agencies to assess the risk for each component of identity assurance—identity proofing, authentication, and federation— rather than conducting a single risk assessment for the entire process. According to NIST officials, this approach gives agencies flexibility in choosing technical solutions; aligns with existing, standards-based market offerings; is modular and cost-effective; and enhances individual privacy. In short, following NIST’s new guidance will help provide IRS with better risk-based assurance that the person trying to access IRS’s online services is who they claim to be. As noted in our report, IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement the new NIST guidance. These efforts include forming a task force to guide IRS’s implementation of NIST guidance and working with the Security Summit to develop an implementation framework for state and industry partners. IRS has also begun analyzing gaps between IRS’s current authentication procedures and the new guidance. In addition, in December 2017, IRS implemented a more secure online authentication option consistent with the new guidance through its mobile application, IRS2Go. After taxpayers link their IRS online account with the mobile app, they can use it to generate a security code to log into their account. This option provides taxpayers with an alternative to receiving the security code via a text message, which NIST considers to be less secure. We recommended that IRS develop a plan—including a timeline, milestone dates, and resources needed—for implementing changes to its online authentication programs consistent with new NIST guidance, and also implement these improvements. IRS agreed with our recommendations, but noted that its ability to complete these efforts will depend on the availability of resources. Second, we found that IRS lacks a comprehensive, repeatable process to identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and approaches. Our discussions with representatives from industry and financial institutions and with government officials indicate that there is no single, ideal online authentication solution that will solve IRS’s challenges related to IDT refund fraud. These representatives advocate an approach to authentication that relies on multiple strategies and sources of information, while giving taxpayers options for further protecting their information. We identified several authentication options in our report that IRS could consider, including the following: Possession-based authentication. This type of authentication offers users a convenient, added layer of security when used as a second factor for accessing websites or systems that would otherwise rely on a username and password for single-factor authentication. For example, as noted in our report, according to an industry official, authentication using a trusted device or “security key” based on Universal Second Factor standards complies with NIST’s new guidance for digital authentication. While IRS is not likely to provide the devices to taxpayers, it could enable its systems to accept these trusted devices as authenticators for taxpayers who elect to use them. Working with trusted partners. IRS could partner with organizations it trusts that are accessible to taxpayers and enable the partners to identity-proof and authenticate taxpayers. Trusted partners could include tax preparers, financial institutions, or other federal or state agencies. In the course of our work, IRS officials stated that they had been exploring such options with both the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service; however, at the time of our report, the agencies had not yet made decisions about next steps. Expanding existing IRS services to further protect taxpayers. IRS could expand the functionality of its online account to further protect taxpayers from IDT refund fraud. For example, IRS could develop additional functionality that allows the taxpayer to designate a bank account or a preference for a paper check for receiving a tax refund. If a fraudster filed a return with different information, the return would be automatically rejected. IRS officials told us the agency continually researches new identity assurance processes and technologies and has talked with other agencies, industry groups, and vendors to better understand how particular technology solutions could apply to IRS’s environment. However, during the course of our work, IRS could not provide us evidence of a repeatable, comprehensive process to identify and evaluate available authentication technologies and services. Such a process could compare options for in-house authentication solutions with off-the-shelf solutions based on estimates of cost, schedule, and benefits, as applicable. To this end, we recommended that IRS develop a process to identify and evaluate alternative options for improving taxpayer authentication, including technologies in use by industry, states, or other trusted partners; and based on this approach, include and prioritize these options, as appropriate, in its Roadmap. IRS agreed with these recommendations, but did not provide additional details on how it plans to address them. In conclusion, IRS’s authentication environment is one component of a broad, complex information technology infrastructure, and we have previously reported on the many challenges the agency faces as it modernizes its tax systems. Taxpayer authentication has become more difficult with the wide availability of personally identifiable information and fraudsters’ ability to develop more complex and sophisticated methods to commit fraud undetected. Addressing the issues we describe above could better position IRS to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in its authentication efforts and better protect taxpayers and the Treasury.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has identified over 100 interactions requiring taxpayer authentication based on potential risks to IRS and individuals. IRS authenticates millions of taxpayers each year via telephone, online, in person, and correspondence to ensure that it is interacting with legitimate taxpayers. IRS's estimated costs to authenticate taxpayers vary by channel. IRS has made progress on monitoring and improving authentication, including developing an authentication strategy with high-level strategic efforts. However, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. Doing so would help IRS clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits. Further, while IRS regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications, it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence channels, including mechanisms to collect reliable, useful data to monitor authentication outcomes. As a result, IRS may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system. IRS can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters. While IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) new guidance for secure digital authentication, it does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement it by June 2018, as required by the Office of Management and Budget. As a result, IRS may not be positioned to address its most vulnerable authentication areas in a timely manner. Further, IRS lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies.

{"input": "", "context": "With a staff of over 47,000 members, the Coast Guard operates a multimission fleet of 201 fixed and rotary-wing aircraft and over 1,400 boats and ships. Operational control of surface and air assets is divided into two geographic Areas (Pacific and Atlantic), within which are nine Districts consisting of 37 sectors and the stations within them. The Coast Guard’s program oversight, policy development, and personnel administration are carried out at the Coast Guard’s headquarters. As shown in table 1, the Coast Guard is responsible for 11 statutory missions identified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended. The Coast Guard manages these missions through six mission programs, also listed in table 1. As part of its marine safety mission, for example, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations, including those involving commercial fishing vessels, which are part of an industry with one of the highest death rates of any industry in the United States. For each of its 11 missions, the Coast Guard has developed goals and targets to assess and communicate agency performance. The Coast Guard’s performance assessment process also includes identifying performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet performance goals. As part of its process, the Coast Guard is to establish targets for the current and subsequent 2 fiscal years, according to Coast Guard officials. Each target is set by the Coast Guard, but according to the Coast Guard’s Annual Performance Report (APR), some are derived from external factors. For example, DHS requires that Coast Guard set a 100 percent target for the percent of people in imminent danger saved in the maritime environment. Further, several of the Coast Guard’s assets used to conduct these missions are approaching the end of their intended service lives. As part of its efforts to modernize its assets used to carry out various missions, the Coast Guard has begun acquiring new vessels, such as the National Security Cutter, the Fast Response Cutter as well as other assets. However, concerns surrounding the affordability of this effort remain as the Coast Guard continues to pursue multiple new acquisitions without long-term planning to guide the affordability of its acquisition portfolio. Figure 1 shows the Coast Guard’s Fast Response Cutter and National Security Cutter. We previously reported on actions the Coast Guard could take to ensure that, among other things, it addresses limitations posed by incomplete data, the use of unrealistic asset performance data, and limitations with its performance goal data, for more effective program management. Examples of data limitations that we have recommended that the Coast Guard take action on are below. Improve completeness of mission data. In December 2017, we found that several different federal agencies play a role in overseeing and promoting commercial fishing vessel safety, including the Coast Guard. As part of its marine safety activities, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations. Commercial fishing has one of the highest death rates of any industry in the United States and vessel disasters are the leading cause of fatalities among fishers, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. However, our December 2017 review found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard’s knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard collects some data on commercial fishing vessels that operate in federal waters—including a vessel’s length and construction date—but data on the population of the active U.S. commercial fishing vessel fleet are not complete. Between 2006 and 2015, the Coast Guard investigated 2,101 commercial fishing vessel accidents that were identified as occurring in federal waters. While the number of accidents generally increased over this time period, the number of injuries and fatalities declined over the same 10-year period. However, we could not assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery— meaning the area in which a certain type of fish (e.g., shrimp, salmon, crab) is caught—because the Coast Guard’s data is not complete. Further, we were unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities, because reliable data on certain information needed to do so—including the total number of vessels that are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel operates—are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast Guard or other federal agencies. Having this information could be useful to carrying out the Coast Guard’s marine safety mission, which includes enforcing laws to prevent death, injury and property loss in the marine environment. We recommended in our December 2017 report that the Coast Guard ensure that data it collects during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. We also recommended that the Coast Guard work with stakeholders to form a working group to determine an efficient means to establish a reliable estimate of the population of active commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard agreed with both recommendations, and in February 2018 informed us that it is in the process of developing additional data fields to capture more information, such as the fishery in which the commercial fishing is involved, and is engaging stakeholders to establish an appropriate working group. We will continue to monitor these actions. Use more realistic asset performance data. In our May 2016 report on Coast Guard strategic planning, we found that the Coast Guard did not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission. We reported that the Coast Guard’s strategic allocations of assets were based on unrealistic assumptions about the performance capacity of its assets and did not reflect asset condition and unscheduled maintenance. This was due, in part, to the Coast Guard not including information from its field units on the actual performance of its assets. For example, agency officials noted that one of its classes of cutters was 50 years old and these cutters were hampered by mechanical failures requiring emergency dry dock repairs, which resulted in reduced availability to carry out their missions during the year. In another example, a field unit stated that based on historical use, it planned for 575 hours per vessel for one type of cutter instead of the 825 hours performance capacity. Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset performance capacities, there is not a direct alignment between the Coast Guard’s strategic operational goals and its prospects for achieving those goals. As a result, the headquarters’ strategic intent, which is based on asset capacity rather than actual performance, did not provide the field with strategic, realistic goals for allocating assets by mission. Agencies should use quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely to achieve objectives and address related risks. We recommended that the Coast Guard incorporate field unit input, such as information on assets’ actual performance, to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation, and in February 2018 informed us that it plans to address this recommendation through changes to two process documents that are under revision, with an expected completion date in March 2018. Improve performance goal data. In our October 2017 review of Coast Guard performance goals, we reported that the Coast Guard and DHS identified limitations with two of the seven selected performance goals we reviewed, including the five year average number of recreational boating deaths and injuries. In particular, officials believe that many recreational boating injuries that do not require hospitalization are not reported to the Coast Guard. These officials believe that the amount of underreporting may vary over time due to changes in industry trends, making it difficult to accurately determine actual injury rates and program performance. We determined that the data for this performance goal was not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives due to these likely limitations. We found that the Coast Guard did not report the possible extent of these limitations with this performance goal in its fiscal year 2016 APR. For the other performance goal, the Coast Guard and DHS identified limitations with the number of detected incursions of foreign fishing vessels violating U.S. waters, which is publicly reported in DHS’s APR. DHS’s review of this performance goal, reported in August 2015, raised questions about the validity of this goal—that is, whether it provides a useful measure of the Coast Guard’s performance. Specifically, the review noted that this performance goal is intended to measure a deterrence effect, but doing so is inherently difficult and may lead to contradictory interpretations of performance. In October 2017, we found that the data for this performance goal was sufficiently reliable for our reporting objective purposes, but questions remain about its validity. Reliable data is not a useful indication of performance unless it is also a valid representation of the goal being addressed. DHS officials reported that they did not include a discussion of the limitations for this performance goal in DHS’s fiscal year 2015 APR because the performance goal met the minimum threshold for data reliability despite the goal’s limitations. Coast Guard officials reported they were aware of these limitations and were working with DHS and OMB to improve the performance goal and implement corrective actions within 1 to 2 years. We recommended that the Coast Guard assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations and update these documents, as needed, based on the results of the assessment. The Coast Guard concurred and in February 2018, informed us that it had taken initial actions to address our recommendation. However, our preliminary review of these actions indicates that further action will be needed to fully address our recommendation, such as documenting and reporting the limitations of performance data. Our previous reports have identified areas in which the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of its data used for reporting on its mission performance and planning. Improve transparency of data on mission performance. In our October 2017 report on performance goals, we found that the Coast Guard’s APR has not been released publicly since 2011 due to a previous DHS leadership decision. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard’s missions. For example, one of the Coast Guard’s missions—defense readiness—has no goals that are publicly reported or shared with Congress, even though measures related to defense readiness are included in the Coast Guard’s APR. Coast Guard officials stated that they could see the benefit of publicly releasing their APR; however, DHS’s decision to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly has so far deterred the Coast Guard from pursuing the public release of its APR. DHS officials told us that the department is concerned about conflicting information that a component’s APR might present because it is vetted and produced separately from the DHS APR. However, the lack of transparency regarding performance data shared publicly and with Congress can result in an incomplete picture of mission performance and can limit effective oversight of Coast Guard operations. As a result, the public and Congress may be unable to determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is meeting its missions. We recommended that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the Coast Guard’s public website. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation and in February 2018, the Coast Guard informed us that it had completed its 2017 APR and are determining an appropriate approach for making it publicly available. Improve capital planning transparency. In our previously issued work on the Coast Guard’s annual 5-year capital investment plan (CIP), we found that the CIP does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs that are made as part of the annual budget cycle. We made several recommendations in recent years intended to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult tradeoff decisions it will likely face. The Coast Guard generally concurred with these recommendations and is in various stages of implementation. For example, in 2017 we reported that we have made recommendations that DHS and the Coast Guard take several actions to gain an understanding of what the Coast Guard needs to meet its mission within its likely acquisition funding levels. These recommended actions included the Coast Guard: (1) conducting a comprehensive portfolio review across all its acquisitions to develop revised baselines that meet mission needs and reflect realistic funding scenarios and (2) developing a 20-year plan that identifies all necessary recapitalization efforts and any fiscal resources likely necessary to complete these efforts. For example, in 2014 we recommended the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources needed to acquire them. Without these efforts, the Coast Guard will continue, as it has in recent years, to plan its future acquisitions through the annual budgeting process, an approach that has led to delayed and reduced capabilities. In 2016, the Coast Guard revised its 2005 Mission Needs Statement, which provides a basic foundation for long-term investment planning that is to serve as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of various fleet mixes, and inform the Coast Guard’s CIP. However, the 2016 Mission Needs Statement did not identify specific assets the Coast Guard needs to achieve its missions, nor did it update the annual hours it needs from each asset class to satisfactorily complete its missions. The Coast Guard has stated it is developing a 20-year Long-term Major Acquisition Plan, but it has not stated when the plan will be completed or what will be included in this plan, such as potential trade-offs that could be made across the Coast Guard’s portfolio of acquisitions to better meet mission needs within realistic funding levels. A long-term plan with a tradeoff analysis would facilitate a full understanding of the affordability challenges facing the Coast Guard while it builds the Offshore Patrol Cutter. DHS concurred with our 2014 recommendation, but it is unclear when the Coast Guard plans to complete the 20-year plan. Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and members of the sub- committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have at this time.

To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

{"input": "", "context": "DHS leads the federal government’s efforts to secure our nation’s public and private critical infrastructure information systems against cyber threats. As part of these efforts, cybersecurity professionals can help to prevent or mitigate the vulnerabilities that could allow malicious individuals and groups access to federal information technology (IT) systems. The ability to secure federal systems depends on the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the federal and contractor workforce that designs, develops, implements, secures, maintains, and uses these systems. The Office of Management and Budget has noted that the federal government and private industry face a persistent shortage of cybersecurity and IT talent to implement and oversee information security protections. This shortage may leave federal IT systems vulnerable to malicious attacks. Experienced and qualified cybersecurity professionals are essential in performing DHS’s work to mitigate vulnerabilities in its own and other agencies’ computer systems and to defend against cyber threats. Since 1997, we have identified the protection of federal information systems as a governmentwide high-risk area. In addition, in 2001, we introduced strategic governmentwide human capital management as another area of high risk. We have also identified a number of challenges federal agencies are facing to ensure that they have a sufficient cybersecurity workforce with the skills necessary to protect their information and networks from cyber threats. These challenges pertain to identifying and closing skill gaps as part of a comprehensive workforce planning process, recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and navigating the federal hiring process. In recent years, the federal government has taken various steps aimed at improving the cybersecurity workforce. These include establishing a national initiative to promote cybersecurity training and skills and developing guidance to address cybersecurity workforce challenges. Founded in 2010, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) is a partnership among government, academia, and the private sector, and is coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The NICE mission promotes cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development in coordination with its partners. The initiative’s goal is to increase the number of skilled cybersecurity professionals in order to boost national IT security. In 2013, NICE published the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework to provide a consistent way to define and describe cybersecurity work at any public or private organization, including federal agencies. In 2014, OPM developed guidance for assigning 2-digit employment codes for each cybersecurity work category and specialty area identified in the 2013 NICE framework. Federal agencies can use the codes to identify cybersecurity positions in personnel and payroll systems, such the system of the National Finance Center. To further enhance efforts to strengthen the cybersecurity workforce, NICE subsequently revised the framework in 2017 to include 33 cybersecurity-related specialty areas organized into 7 categories— securely provision, operate and maintain, protect and defend, investigate, collect and operate, analyze, and oversee and govern. The revision defined work roles in specialty areas and cybersecurity tasks for each work role, as well as the knowledge, skills, and abilities that a person should have in order to perform each work role. Also, in 2017, OPM issued guidance creating a unique 3-digit employment code for each cybersecurity work role. In October 2017, NIST issued guidance that reflected the finalized 2017 NICE framework and included a crosswalk of OPM’s 2-digit employment codes to the 3-digit codes. DHS is the third largest department in the federal government, employing approximately 240,000 people, and operating with an annual budget of about $60 billion, of which about $6.4 billion was reportedly spent on IT in fiscal year 2017. In leading the federal government’s efforts to secure our nation’s public and private critical infrastructure information systems, the department, among other things, collects and shares information related to cyber threats and cybersecurity risks and incidents with other federal partners to enable real-time actions to address these risks and incidents. The department is made up of 15 operational and support components that perform its critical mission functions. Table 1 describes the 6 components that we included in our review. The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to perform workforce assessment-related activities to identify and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions. Specifically, the act called for DHS to: 1. Establish procedures for identifying and categorizing cybersecurity positions and assigning codes to positions (within 90 days of law’s enactment). 2. Identify all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions and determine the work category and specialty area of each. 3. Assign OPM 2-digit employment codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions based on the position’s primary cybersecurity work category and specialty areas, as set forth in OPM’s Guide to Data Standards. In addition, after completing the aforementioned activities, the act called for the department to take steps to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. Specifically, DHS was to: 4. Identify the cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need in the department’s cybersecurity workforce and report to Congress. 5. Submit to OPM an annual report through 2021 that describes work categories and specialty areas of critical need and substantiates the critical need designations. The act required DHS to complete the majority of these activities by specific due dates between March 2015 and September 2016. Within DHS, OCHCO is responsible for carrying out these provisions, including the coordination of the department’s overall efforts to identify, categorize, code, and report its cybersecurity workforce assessment progress to OPM and Congress. The act required DHS to establish procedures to identify and assign the appropriate employment code, in accordance with OPM’s Guide to Data Standards, to all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions by March 2015. In addition, DHS’s April 2016 Cybersecurity Workforce Coding guidance states that components should ensure procedures are in place to monitor and to update the employment codes as positions change over time. Further, the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government recommends that management assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles and that each component develop individual procedures to implement objectives. The standards also recommend that management periodically review such procedures to see that they are developed, relevant, and effective. DHS OCHCO developed departmental procedures in May 2014 and recommended implementation steps for coding positions with cybersecurity functions for the department’s components. However, OCHCO did not update its procedures to include information on identifying positions and assigning codes until April 2016—13 months after the due date specified by the act. In addition, the procedures were not complete because they did not include information related to identifying and coding vacant positions, as the act required. Moreover, the departmental procedures did not identify the individual within each DHS component who was responsible for leading and overseeing the identification and coding of the component’s cybersecurity positions. Further, although components were able to supplement the departmental procedures by developing their own component-specific procedures for identifying and coding their cybersecurity positions, OCHCO did not review those procedures for consistency with departmental guidance. The department could not provide documentation that OCHCO had verified or reviewed component-developed procedures. In addition, OCHCO officials acknowledged that they had not reviewed the components’ procedures and had not developed a process for conducting such reviews. OCHCO officials stated that several factors had limited their ability to develop the procedures and to review component-developed procedures in a timely and complete manner. These factors were (1) a delayed departmental decision until April 2016 as to whether certain positions should be considered cybersecurity positions; (2) a belief that each component had the best understanding of their human capital systems, so procedure development was best left up to each component; (3) a condition where each of the six selected DHS components recorded and tracked vacant positions differently; and (4) cybersecurity specialty areas for vacant positions were not known until a position description was developed or verified and a hiring action was imminent. Without assurance that procedures are timely, complete, and reviewed, DHS cannot be certain that its components have the procedures to identify and code all positions with cybersecurity functions, as required by the act. Accordingly, our February 2018 report included recommendations that DHS 1) develop procedures on how to identify and code vacant cybersecurity positions, 2) identify the individual in each component who is responsible for leading that component’s efforts in identifying and coding cybersecurity positions, and 3) establish and implement a process to periodically review each component’s procedures for identifying component cybersecurity positions and maintaining accurate coding. DHS concurred with the recommendations and stated that it would implement them by April 30, 2018. The act required DHS to identify all of its cybersecurity positions, including vacant positions, by September 2015. Further, the act called for the department to use OPM’s Guide to Data Standards to categorize the identified positions and determine the work category or specialty area of each position. As of December 2016, the department reported that it had identified 10,725 cybersecurity positions, including 6,734 federal civilian positions, 584 military positions, and 3,407 contractor positions. Nevertheless, as of November 2017, the department had not completed identifying all of its cybersecurity positions and it had not determined the work categories or specialty areas of the positions. In explaining why the department had not identified all its positions, OCHCO officials stated that components varied in reporting their identified vacant positions because the department did not have a system to track vacancies. Of the 7 work categories and 33 specialty areas in the NICE framework, DHS reported that its 3 most common work categories were “protect and defend”, “securely provision,” and “oversight and development;” and its 2 most common specialty areas were “security program management” and “vulnerability assessment and management.” However, DHS could not provide data to show the actual numbers of positions in each of these categories and specialty areas. According to OCHCO officials, the department was still in the process of identifying positions for the 2-digit codes and would continue this effort until the 3-digit codes were available in the National Finance Center personnel and payroll system in December 2017. At that time, OCHCO officials stated that the department intends to start developing procedures for identifying and coding positions using the 3-digit codes. The act also required DHS to assign 2-digit employment codes to all of its identified cybersecurity positions. This action was to be completed by September 2015. However, as of August 2017—23 months after the due date—the department had not completed the coding assignment process. Although, in August 2017, OPM provided a progress report to Congress containing DHS data which stated that 95 percent of DHS-identified cybersecurity positions had been coded, our analysis determined that the department had assigned cybersecurity position codes to approximately 79 percent of its identified federal civilian cybersecurity positions. The primary reason for this discrepancy was that DHS did not include the coding of vacant positions, as required by the act. Further, OCHCO officials stated they did not verify the accuracy of the components’ cybersecurity workforce data. Without coding cybersecurity positions in a complete and accurate manner, DHS will not be able to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce; identify skill gaps; and improve workforce planning. Thus, in our recently issued report, we recommended that OCHCO collect complete and accurate data on all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions when it conducts its cybersecurity identification and coding efforts. DHS concurred with the recommendation and stated that, by June 29, 2018, it intends to issue memorandums to its components that provide instructions for the components to periodically review compliance and cybersecurity workforce data concerns to ensure data accuracy. According to the act, DHS was to identify its cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need in alignment with the NICE framework and to report this information to the appropriate congressional committees by June 2016. In addition, a DHS directive required the DHS Chief Human Capital Officer to provide guidance to the department’s components on human resources procedures, including identifying workforce needs. As of February 2018, the department had not fulfilled its requirements to identify and report its critical needs. Although DHS identified workforce skills gaps in a report that it submitted to congressional committees in March 2017, the department did not align the skills gaps to the NICE framework’s defined work categories and specialty areas of critical need. In September 2017, OCHCO developed a draft document that attempted to crosswalk identified department-wide cybersecurity skills gaps to one or more specialty areas in the NICE framework. However, the document did not adequately help components identify their critical needs by aligning their gaps with the NICE framework because it did not provide clear guidance to help components determine a critical need in cases in which a skills gap is mapped to multiple work categories. According to OCHCO officials, DHS had not identified department-wide cybersecurity critical needs that aligned with the framework partly because OPM did not provide DHS with guidance for identifying cybersecurity critical needs. In addition, OCHCO officials stated that the components did not generally view critical skills gaps in terms of the categories or specialty areas as defined in the NICE framework, but instead, described their skills gaps using position titles that are familiar to them. In the absence of relevant guidance to help components identify their critical needs, DHS and the components are hindered from effectively identifying and prioritizing workforce efforts to recruit, hire, train, develop, and retain cybersecurity personnel. DHS also did not report cybersecurity critical needs to OPM in September 2016 or September 2017, as required. Instead, the department first reported its cybersecurity coding progress and skills gaps in a March 2017 report that it sent to OPM and Congress to address several of the act’s requirements. However, the report did not describe or substantiate critical need designations because DHS has not yet identified them. Additionally, DHS had not developed plans or time frames to complete priority actions—developing a DHS cybersecurity workforce strategy and completing its initial cybersecurity workforce research— that OCHCO officials said must be completed before it can report its cybersecurity critical needs to OPM. According to OCHCO officials, the report that the department submitted to Congress in March 2017 had contained plans and schedules. However, we found that the March 2017 report did not capture and sequence all of the activities that DHS officials said must be completed in order to report critical needs. Until DHS develops plans and schedules with time frames for reporting its cybersecurity critical needs, DHS may not have insight into its needs for ensuring that it has the workforce necessary to carry out its critical role of helping to secure the nation’s cyberspace. In our report, we recommended that DHS 1) develop guidance to assist DHS components in identifying their cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need that align to the NICE framework and 2) develop plans with time frames to identify priority actions to report on specialty areas of critical need. DHS concurred with the recommendations and stated that it plans to implement them by June 2018. In summary, DHS needs to act now to completely and accurately identify, categorize, and assign codes to all of its cybersecurity positions, and to identify and report on its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. Implementing the six recommendations we made in our February 2018 report should better position the department to meet the requirements of the 2014 act. Further, doing so will help DHS understand its needs for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining a cybersecurity workforce with the skills necessary to accomplish the department’s varied and essential cybersecurity mission. Until DHS implements our recommendations, it will not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department’s and federal networks and the nation’s critical infrastructure from cyber threats.

The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to all of the department's cybersecurity workforce positions. These codes define work roles and tasks for cybersecurity specialty areas such as program management and system administration. Further, the act required DHS to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce critical needs. GAO was asked to testify on the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. To do so, GAO summarized the findings discussed in its February 2018 report on DHS's cybersecurity workforce ( GAO-18-175 ). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 ; however, its actions have not been timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS did not complete efforts to identify all of the department's cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. In August 2017, DHS reported to Congress that it had coded 95 percent of the department's identified cybersecurity positions. However, the department had, at that time, coded approximately 79 percent of the positions. DHS's 95 percent estimate was overstated primarily because it excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions. In addition, although DHS has taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it has not identified or reported to Congress on its departmentwide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also has not reported annually its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required, and has not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. (See table). Without ensuring that its procedures are complete and that its progress in identifying and assigning codes to its cybersecurity positions is accurately reported, DHS will not be positioned to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning. Further, until DHS establishes plans and time frames for reporting on its critical needs, the department may not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department's and the nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The commitment of DHS's leadership to addressing these matters is essential to helping the department fulfill the act's requirements. In its February 2018 report, GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed. DHS concurred with the six recommendations and described actions the department plans to take to address them."], "length": 3486, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "278810715acea7581d80c9b5e20ca64bf4efed96d0db0907"}
{"input": "", "context": "The United States Fire Administration (USFA) is currently an entity within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Its mission is to provide leadership, coordination, and support for the nation's fire prevention and control, fire training and education, and emergency medical services activities, and to prepare first responders and health care leaders to react to hazard and terrorism emergencies of all kinds. One of USFA's key objectives is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. Although fire loss has improved significantly over the past 25 years, the fire problem in the United States remains serious. The United States still has one of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), in 2015 there were 1,345,500 total fires reported, 3,280 civilian fire deaths, 15,700 civilian fire injuries, and an estimated $14.3 billion in direct property loss. There were 69 on-duty firefighter deaths in 2016. The genesis of USFA and FEMA's fire prevention and control activities can be found in the landmark 1973 report of the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, entitled America Burning . The commission recommended the creation of a federal fire agency which would provide support to state and local governments and private fire organizations in their efforts to reduce fire deaths, injuries, and property loss. The commission recommended that this new agency be placed within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Congress instead opted to place the agency in the Department of Commerce, and with the passage of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-498 ), the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (NFPCA) was established. In 1978, Congress changed the name of NFPCA to USFA ( P.L. 95-422 ), and in 1979, President Carter's Reorganization Plan No. 3 placed the USFA within the newly created FEMA. Also in 1979, the National Fire Academy (NFA) in Emmitsburg, MD, was opened, offering courses and training to fire service personnel and other persons engaged in fire prevention and control. During the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration proposed the elimination of the USFA (while preserving the Fire Academy). Although Congress did not allow the termination of the USFA, the agency suffered severe staff reductions and the Fire Academy was separated from the USFA and housed organizationally with other FEMA emergency training programs. In 1991, the NFA was subsequently reorganized back into the USFA, where it remains today. Currently, the USFA is located on the grounds of the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, MD. USFA programs include the following: Data Collection —USFA's National Fire Data Center (NFDC) administers a national system (the National Fire Incident Reporting System or NFIRS) used for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data and information on fire and other emergency incidents to state and local governments and the fire community. The NFDC provides a national analysis of the fire problem, identifying problem areas for which prevention and mitigation strategies are needed. Public Education and Awareness —Through partnerships and special initiatives, USFA involves the fire service, the media, other federal agencies, and safety interest groups in the development and delivery of fire safety awareness and education programs. These programs are targeted at those groups most vulnerable to the hazards of fire, including the young, elderly, and disabled. Training —USFA's National Fire Academy (NFA) offers educational opportunities for the advanced professional development of the mid-level and senior fire/EMS officers and allied professionals involved in fire prevention and life safety activities. The academy develops and delivers educational and training programs with a national focus that supplement and support state and local fire service training. The NFA also offers training to support the National Incident Management System Integration Center (NIC) and nationwide implementation of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Research and Technology —Through research, testing, and evaluation, USFA works with public and private entities to promote and improve fire and life safety. Research and special studies are conducted on fire detection, suppression, and notification systems, as well as issues related to firefighter and emergency responder health and safety. Research results are published and made available to the public free of charge through the USFA Publications Center. In fulfilling its mission, the USFA uses the assets of the National Fire Academy, the National Emergency Training Center (NETC) Facilities and Support Services, and the National Fire Programs Division. On May 18, 2017, President Trump announced his intention to appoint Chief G. Keith Bryant as the USFA Administrator. G. Keith Bryant was sworn in as the U.S. Fire Administrator on August 4, 2017. The USFA receives its annual appropriation through the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. Table 1 shows recent and proposed appropriated funding for USFA. Beginning in FY2004, the USFA was funded through the Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery (PMRR) account within the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security. On July 13, 2005, then-DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced a restructuring of DHS, effective October 1, 2005. USFA was removed from the PMRR account and received a separate appropriation (its own line item) under the new DHS Directorate for Preparedness. The FY2007 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill ( P.L. 109-295 ) transferred the USFA back to the Federal Emergency Management Agency within DHS. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed $42.3 million for USFA, a 3.8% decrease from the FY2016 level. The request included $1.5 million for facilities improvement under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. The budget proposal included $500,000 for distance learning capability and reductions of $1 million each for NFIRS and state fire training grants. The budget request would also transfer the stand-alone USFA budget account into the Preparedness and Protection activity under FEMA's broader Federal Assistance account. On May 26, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 3001 , the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2017. The Senate bill would provide $44 million for USFA, which matches the FY2016 level and is $1.688 million above the request. In the accompanying report ( S.Rept. 114-68 ), the committee stated that the increase over the Administration request should allow for the continued development of NFIRS and support for the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. The committee maintained a separate budget account for USFA and did not transfer the USFA budget account to the Federal Assistance account as proposed in the Administration budget request. On June 22, 2016, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017. Unlike the Senate, the House committee transferred the USFA budget account into a broader \"Federal Assistance\" account in FEMA. The bill provided $42.5 million for USFA under the Federal Assistance account and $1.5 million under Procurement, Construction, and Improvements for National Fire Academy facility costs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ) funded USFA at a total level of $44 million in FY2017. This consisted of $42.5 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.5 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. For FY2018, the Administration requested $43.41 million for USFA, slightly below the FY2017 level of $44 million. The FY2018 level consists of $41.913 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.497 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. According to the FY2018 budget proposal, the request reflects a $1 million reduction to the State Fire Training Assistance grants. On July 18, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 ( H.R. 3355 ; H.Rept. 115-239 ). The bill provided the same level as the Administration request: $41.913 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.497 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. On September 14, 2017, the House passed H.R. 3354 , a FY2018 omnibus appropriations bill that includes funding for USFA. During floor consideration, the House adopted an amendment offered by Representative Pascrell that added $1 million for USFA's State Fire Training Assistance grants, thereby restoring the Administration's proposed reduction. H.R. 3354 would provide a total of $44.41 million for USFA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ) provided $44.397 million for USFA. This total included $1.497 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. State Fire Training Assistance grants continued to be funded by USFA. For FY2019, the Administration requested $44.993 million for USFA. The FY2019 level consisted of $43.493 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.5 million for annual capital improvement of the National Emergency Training Center under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 3109 , the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2019 ( S.Rept. 115-283 ). The Senate bill would provide $44 million to USFA in the Federal Assistance account, $507,000 above the budget request, to ensure the National Fire Academy can fulfill its mission of providing training and professional development without reducing its ability to carry out other important responsibilities. The bill report directed FEMA to continue its traditional funding for the congressionally mandated National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. S. 3109 would also provide $1.5 million for annual capital improvement of the National Emergency Training Center under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. On July 25, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2019 Homeland Security bill. Identical to the Administration's budget request, the House bill would provide $43.493 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.5 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million for USFA, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-169 ) was signed into law on December 6, 2003. The act reauthorized the USFA through FY2008 at the following levels: $63 million for FY2005, $64.85 million for FY2006, $66.796 million for FY2007, and $68.8 million for FY2008. P.L. 108-169 also reestablished the presidentially appointed position of the U.S. Fire Administrator, which had been statutorily abolished by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Additionally, the legislation directed the USFA to develop new firefighting technologies and standards in coordination with private sector standards groups and federal, state, and local agencies. P.L. 108-169 required that equipment purchased with fire grant money meet or exceed voluntary consensus standards when feasible. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 was signed into law on October 8, 2008 ( P.L. 110-376 ). P.L. 110-376 authorized the USFA at $70 million for FY2009, $72.1 million for FY2010, $74.263 million for FY2011, and $76.491 million for FY2012. Provisions included authorizing National Fire Academy training program modifications and reports; directing the National Fire Academy to provide training on incidents occurring in the wildfire-urban interface, multijurisdictional fires, hazardous materials incidents, and advanced emergency medical services; authorizing USFA to enter into contracts with one or more nationally recognized third-party organizations to deliver training; a report on the feasibility of providing incident command training for fires at ports and in marine environments; national fire incident reporting system upgrades; sponsoring and disseminating research on fire prevention and control at the wildland-urban interface; encouraging adoption of national voluntary consensus standards for firefighter health and safety; establishing a state and local fire service position at the National Operations Center within DHS; providing coordination regarding fire prevention and control and emergency medical services; and expressing congressional support for USFA recommendations for adoption and education regarding sprinklers in commercial and residential buildings. On January 2, 2013, the President signed P.L. 112-239 , the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Title XVIII, Subtitle B was the U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2012, which authorized USFA through FY2017. P.L. 112-239 included the following provisions: reauthorized USFA at an annual level of $76,490,890 for FY2013 through FY2017, and for each fiscal year sets aside $2,753,672 to be used to carry out Section 8(f) of the Fire Prevention and Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2207) related to evaluation of technology and development of standards; authorized the USFA Administrator to appoint a Deputy Administrator; authorized the Administrator to take such steps as the Administrator considers appropriate to educate the public and overcome public indifference as to fire, fire prevention, and individual preparedness; and removed the limitation on funding levels for updating the National Fire Incident Reporting System. In the 115 th Congress, on July 12, 2017, the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology, Committee on Science, Space and Technology, held a hearing entitled U.S. Fire Administration and Fire Grant Programs Reauthorization: Examining Effectiveness and Priorities . Testimony was heard from the USFA acting administrator and from fire service organizations. On December 15, 2017, H.R. 4661 , the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017, was introduced by Representative Comstock, which sought to reauthorize the USFA through FY2023. On December 18, 2017, the House passed H.R. 4661 by voice vote under suspension of the rules. On December 21, 2017, the Senate passed H.R. 4661 without amendment by unanimous consent. On January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-98 ). P.L. 115-98 extends the USFA authorization through FY2023. The authorization levels are the same as in the previous authorization: $76,490,890 each year for FY2017 through FY2023, of which $2,753,672 each fiscal year is to be used to carry out Section 8(f) of the Fire Prevention and Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2207) related to evaluation of technology and development of standards. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program, also known as the FIRE Act grant program, was established by Title XVII of the FY2001 Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 106-398 ). The program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs. A related program is the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters (SAFER) program, which provides grants for hiring, recruiting, and retaining firefighters. Since its inception, the fire grant program has been administered by FEMA/USFA (FY2001-FY2003), the Office for Domestic Preparedness (FY2004), the Office of State and Local Government Coordination Preparedness (FY2005), and the Office of Grants and Training in the DHS Directorate for Preparedness (FY2006). The FY2007 DHS Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-295 ) transferred USFA to FEMA and the fire and SAFER grants to the Grants Programs Directorate in FEMA. Congressional appropriations reports have consistently instructed DHS to maintain USFA involvement in the grant administration process for AFG and SAFER grants. In September 2016, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report entitled Fire Grants: FEMA Could Enhance Program Administration and Performance Assessment. Among its findings, GAO concluded that FEMA has not defined and documented USFA's specific role or responsibilities with the fire grants program, and that there is no formalized relationship or policy regarding how the two organizations' programs could work together. According to GAO Although a level of informal coordination exists between GPD [Grant Programs Directorate] and USFA, enhancing these efforts by using collaborative mechanisms that our work across the federal government has identified as key features and issues to consider during implementation—such as clearly defining and agreeing upon USFA's role and responsibilities and documenting agreement regarding how they will be collaborating—could help GPD further leverage USFA expertise and resources in support of the fire grants programs, which could also help GPD manage the integration of fire grants into broader national preparedness efforts. In December 2016, the USFA signed an agreement with FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate to provide a framework for each entity's roles and responsibilities for improving the management of the fire grants. Concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact future funding levels for the USFA. Debate over the USFA budget has focused on whether the USFA is receiving an appropriate level of funding to accomplish its mission, given that appropriations for USFA have consistently been well below the agency's authorized level, and given that USFA's budget has remained flat over recent years. The 116 th Congress may also consider whether the role of USFA might be expanded. For example, H.R. 1646 , the Helping Emergency Responders Overcome Act of 2019 (the HERO Act), introduced by Representative Bera on March 8, 2019, would direct USFA, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to develop and make publicly available resources that may be used by the federal government and other entities to educate mental health professionals about the mental health issues and challenges faced by firefighters and emergency medical services personnel. Finally, an ongoing issue is the viability and status of the USFA and National Fire Academy within the Department of Homeland Security. While supportive of the reorganization of FEMA into DHS, many in the fire service community have cautioned that USFA and NFA programs—which address the day-to-day challenges faced by fire departments—should not be overshadowed in an organization which focuses on homeland security and counterterrorism. Since the establishment of DHS in March 2003, fire service groups have opposed a number of actions DHS has taken with respect to the USFA and NFA. These included the abolishment of the presidentially appointed position of U.S. Fire Administrator (subsequently reestablished by enactment of the USFA Reauthorization Act of 2003); proposed cancellations of some NFA courses in 2003 due to an across-the-board FEMA budget cut (those NFA courses were subsequently restored after fire service protests); and the transfer of the fire grant program from the USFA to the DHS Office for Domestic Preparedness. ", "answers": ["The United States Fire Administration (USFA)—which includes the National Fire Academy (NFA)—is currently housed within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The objective of the USFA is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance. On January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98).

{"input": "", "context": "T he Agriculture appropriations bill—formally called the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act—funds all of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service. Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ). FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including USDA, unfinished. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2019 ( H.R. 5961 , S. 2976 ), with the Senate having amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus ( H.R. 6147 ). Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018, at the FY2018 level ( P.L. 115-245 and P.L. 115-298 ). After December 21, 2018, a partial shutdown of the government, including many agencies within USDA, occurred. One of the few exceptions was the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown. On January 25, 2019, an agreement was reached to continue funding for USDA and other appropriations that had lapsed through February 15, at the FY2018 level ( P.L. 116-5 ). The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on February 15, 2019, funding USDA through the end of the fiscal year (Division B, P.L. 116-6 ). This report provides a brief overview of the conservation-related provisions in the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations acts. For a general analysis of the FY2018 appropriations for agriculture, see CRS Report R45128, Agriculture and Related Agencies: FY2018 Appropriations , and for FY2019, see CRS Report R45230, Agriculture and Related Agencies: FY2019 Appropriations . USDA administers a number of agricultural conservation programs that assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. These include working land programs, land retirement and easement programs, watershed programs, technical assistance, and other programs. The two lead agricultural conservation agencies within USDA are the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which provides technical assistance and administers most conservation programs, and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which administers the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Most conservation program funding is mandatory, obtained through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and authorized in omnibus farm bills (about $5.3 billion of CCC funds for conservation in FY2018). Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary spending and are funded through annual appropriations (about $1 billion annually). For the first time since FY2002, the FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. It did, however, include legislative changes that affect farm bill programs and watershed programs. Similarly, the FY2019 appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs; however, the enacted 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act, P.L. 115-334 ) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs. The FY2018 appropriations act included a slight increase from FY2017 levels for discretionary conservation programs. The FY2019 appropriations act included a decrease from FY2018 levels for discretionary conservation programs and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (see Table 1 and Figure 1 ). NRCS administers all discretionary conservation programs. The largest program and the account that funds most NRCS activities is Conservation Operations (CO). The CO account primarily funds Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), which provides conservation planning and implementation assistance through field staff placed in almost all counties within the United States and territories. Other components of CO include the Soil Surveys, Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting, and Plant Materials Centers. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million—more than the FY2017 enacted amount ($864 million). The enacted FY2019 appropriation decreases funding for CO below FY2018 levels to $819 million and redirects funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request ($699 million) was less than the amount later enacted for FY2019 due to a proposed consolidation of mandatory and discretionary accounts to pay for conservation technical assistance. The proposal to consolidate funding has been made by USDA through multiple Administrations but never adopted by Congress (see text box below). The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations acts direct CO funding for a number of conservation programs ( Table 1 ). Report language further directs funding to selected activities ( Table 3 ). The enacted FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations also contain funding for watershed activities, including $150 million annually for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO)—a program that assists state and local organizations with planning and installing measures to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage. This is the same level as appropriated in FY2017, which was the first appropriated funding for the WFPO program since FY2010. Beginning in FY2006, Administrations began requesting no funding for WFPO, citing program inflexibility and a backlog of congressionally earmarked projects. The Trump Administration's FY2018 and FY2019 requests proposed no funding for the program. Since FY2014, Congress has directed a portion of CO funds to select WFPO activities. Similar directive language ($5.6 million; see Table 1 ) is in the FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations, in addition to the $150 million made available each fiscal year for the program as a whole. The enacted FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations include $10 million annually for the Watershed Rehabilitation program––a reduction from the FY2017 level of $12 million. The Watershed Rehabilitation program repairs aging dams previously built by USDA under WFPO. The Administration proposed no funding in FY2018 and FY2019. The 2018 farm bill made minor amendments to WFPO, the most substantial being the authorization of permanent mandatory funding of $50 million annually. The new mandatory funding will be in addition to discretionary funding provided through annual appropriations and could be used for either WFPO or Watershed Rehabilitation activities. Mandatory conservation programs are generally authorized in omnibus farm bills and receive funding from the CCC and thus do not require an annual appropriation. In the past, Congress has used annual agriculture appropriations acts to reduce mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) every year from FY2003 to FY2017. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act marked the first appropriation since FY2002 that did not include CHIMPS to conservation programs. This allowed all mandatory conservation programs to utilize their full authorized level of funding in FY2018, minus sequestration. Additionally, prior-year CHIMPS concerning programs that are authorized to remain available until expended (e.g., Watershed Rehabilitation) became available for obligation in FY2018. Nearly all mandatory conservation programs authorized in the 2014 farm bill (Agricultural Act of 2014; P.L. 113-79 ) expired on September 30, 2018. One exception is the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), whose authority was extended to FY2019 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123 ). The 2018 farm bill reauthorized mandatory funding for all conservation programs, including for FY2019. Similar to FY2018, the FY2019 appropriations bill, which was enacted after enactment of the 2018 farm bill, does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. On May 11, 2017, USDA announced the creation of the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area as part of a larger Departmental reorganization. FPAC includes NRCS, FSA, Risk Management Agency (RMA), and a new FPAC Business Center. The FPAC Business Center is responsible for financial management, budgeting, human resources, information technology, acquisitions/procurement, strategic planning, and other customer-oriented operations of the three domestic agriculture agencies (NRCS, FSA, and RMA). The FY2018 Administration budget request was released two weeks following the announcement for FPAC (May 23, 2017), but did not include funding for the FPAC Business Center. The FY2019 Administration budget request did include funding for the Business Center ($196.4 million), as well as a request to transfer funding from other accounts ($76.3 million) to the Business Center. Final enactment of the FY2018 appropriation occurred on March 23, 2018, after the release of the Administration's FY2019 budget request, which occurred on February 12, 2018. The FY2018 appropriation included about $1 million for the Business Center. The FY2018 explanatory statement required USDA to submit an implementation and spending plan to Congress for the new FPAC mission area that would detail requested transfers. USDA submitted the FPAC spending plan on August 28, 2018. The FY2019 appropriation had already been marked up in the House and Senate, and did not include the full level of requested funding for the Business Center. The enacted FY2019 appropriations (February 15, 2019), however, did increase funding for the Business Center. The enacted level is more than the Administration's request and directs a transfer of funds from other accounts into the Business Center, including mandatory conservation programs and farm loan accounts. Funding for NRCS and FSA is reduced accordingly and FPAC Business Center funding shifts are dictated in the FY2019 explanatory statement (see Table 2 ). It is unclear what level of savings is projected from the centralization of agency functions and what this savings will ultimately be redirected toward. Overall, the total changes in funding for the new Business Center do not necessarily reflect a decline in NRCS resources. Total CO (discretionary spending) was reduced between FY2018 and FY2019 by $54.6 million, whereas NRCS' contribution to the FPAC Business Center appropriation for FY2019 is $70.8 million, thus indicating an effective increase of $16.2 million to NRCS in FY2019. This could result in NRCS effectively receiving less in total funding depending whether the amount shifted would have been used for administrative or technical assistance purposes had the Business Center not been in existence. The mandatory conservation program funding ($60.2 million) that is authorized to be transferred to the FPAC Business Center comes from programs authorized to receive CCC funding under 16 U.S.C. 3841(a). Three programs within the conservation title of the 2018 farm bill are included in this transfer—EQIP, CSP, and the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). Other mandatory conservation programs funded through the cited CCC authority (16 U.S.C. 3841(a)) are not included in the transfer, including CRP, which is administered by FSA. The transfer in the FY2019 appropriations act redirects mandatory funding that was authorized in the farm bill. It is unclear what, if any, effect the transfer could have on the implementation of EQIP, CSP, and ACEP, and the financial assistance offered by those programs. In FY2019, a 34-day funding gap lasted from December 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019. It affected agencies funded by 7 of the 12 appropriations bills, including Agriculture appropriations. In general, a shutdown results in the furlough of many personnel and curtailment of affected agency activities and services. Exceptions may allow certain activities to continue, such as for law enforcement, protection of human life or property, and activities funded by other means such as carryover funds or user fees. Agencies make their own determinations about activities and personnel that are \"excepted\" from furlough and publish their intentions in \"contingency plans\" that are supervised by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). USDA published contingency plans for each agency, including NRCS. USDA initially estimated on December 23, 2018, that 61% of its employees were excepted from furlough in the agencies that are funded by Agriculture appropriations (all of USDA except the Forest Service), which amounts to 37,860 staff being excepted out of 62,288. The number of excepted and furloughed personnel varied by agency. As previously discussed, NRCS funds technical assistance and related agency staff through both mandatory and discretionary accounts. As such, NRCS was initially able to claim as excepted 100% of its 9,342 staff using mandatory conservation program funding authorized through the farm bill (and therefore not affected by the lapse in discretionary appropriations), and discretionary carryover funding from prior fiscal years. As the shutdown continued, however, NRCS announced its intention to furlough some employees beginning on February 3, 2019, to conserve carryover balances and focus excepted staff on mandatory farm bill conservation program implementation. This plan was not implemented because the shutdown ended on January 25, 2019. Generally, Congress employs two separate types of legislative measures—authorizations and appropriations. Authorization acts establish, continue, or modify agencies or programs. Appropriations acts generally provide discretionary funding for authorized agencies and programs. While this practice is infrequent and subject to various procedural rules and limitations, the Agriculture appropriations bill may serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs. These amendments generally have the force of law by amending the U.S. Code or by creating a permanent authorization. This is different from policy-related provisions (discussed in the \" Policy-Related Provisions \" section), which generally direct how the executive branch should carry out the appropriations and whose effect is typically limited to the current fiscal year. In some cases, the 2018 farm bill further amended the conservation programs that were amended in the FY2018 appropriations act. Where relevant, these amendments are noted; however, the focus is on amendments made in appropriations acts. The FY2018 agriculture appropriations act included statutory amendments to the WFPO program. Section 761 of P.L. 115-141 amended the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. ) by increasing the size thresholds required for congressional approval under the program. Under the amended language, approval by the Senate and House Agriculture Committees is required for individual projects that need an estimated federal contribution of more than $25 million for construction, an increase from the previous $5 million threshold. This amendment originated in the FY2018 Senate-reported bill ( S. 1603 , §754). The FY2018 appropriation also amended Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-198 ; often referred to as the \"1985 farm bill\") by adding a new section that exempts farm bill conservation programs from certain reporting requirements. Federal grant recipients must comply with government-wide financial management policies and reporting requirements when receiving federal grants and agreements. Many of these reporting requirements are not new for USDA programs and have been in place for a number of years. Interested stakeholders raised concerns when a number of the farm bill conservation programs were designated as grants (rather than direct payments) under a 2010 regulation. This designation triggered the use of a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and System for Award Management (SAM) registration. The DUNS number requirement and SAM registration did not affect individuals or entities that apply for conservation programs using a Social Security number. Rather, it applied only to those applying as an entity with a Taxpayer Identification Number or Employee Identification Number. The amendment exempts producers and landowners who participate in farm bill conservation programs from the DUNS number and SAM registration requirement. The amendment originated in the FY2018 Senate-reported bill ( S. 1603 , §740). The 2018 farm bill moved and expanded this exemption to include conservation, indemnity or disease control, or commodity programs administered by NRCS, FSA, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. In addition to setting budgetary amounts, the Agriculture appropriations bill may also include policy-related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out an appropriation. These provisions may have the force of law if they are included in the text of an appropriations act, but their effect is generally limited to the current fiscal year (see Table 3 ). Unlike the aforementioned authorization amendments that may be included in appropriations acts, policy-related provisions generally do not amend the U.S. Code or have long-standing effects. For example, the WFPO program has historically been called the \"small watershed program,\" because no project may exceed 250,000 acres, and no structure may exceed more than 12,500 acre-feet of floodwater detention capacity or 25,000 acre-feet of total capacity. The FY2018 and FY2019 enacted appropriations also include a policy provision that waives the 250,000-acre project limit when the project's primary purpose is something other than flood prevention. This provision does not amend the WFPO authorization and therefore is effective only for the funds provided during the appropriation year. Table 3 compares some of the policy provisions that have been identified in the Farm Production and Conservation Programs (Title II) and General Provisions (Title VII) titles of the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations bills related to conservation. Many of these provisions were also included in past years' appropriations laws. The explanatory statement that accompanies the final appropriation—and the House and Senate report language that accompanies the committee-reported bills—may also provide policy instructions. These documents do not have the force of law but often explain congressional intent, which the agencies are expected to follow (see Table 4 ). The committee reports and explanatory statement may need to be read together to capture all of the congressional intent for a given fiscal year. Table 4 compares some of the policy provisions that have been identified in the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations reported language related to conservation. The FY2018 enacted report language column includes references to the House (H) and Senate (S) report language, as well as the enacted (E) explanatory statement. The FY2019 enacted report language column includes references to the House (H) and Senate (S) report language, and the enacted (E) conference report. The inclusion of all three reports better captures congressional intent for each fiscal year. Many of these provisions have been included in past years' appropriations laws. Some provisions in report language and bill text address conservation programs not authorized or funded within the annual appropriation (i.e., mandatory spending for farm-bill-authorized programs). ", "answers": ["The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) except for the Forest Service. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 115-141, Division A), and the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6, Division B) include funding for conservation programs and activities at USDA.

Agricultural conservation programs include both mandatory and discretionary spending. Most conservation program funding is mandatory and is authorized in omnibus farm bills. Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary and are funded through annual appropriations. The largest discretionary program is the Conservation Operations (CO) account, which funds conservation planning and implementation assistance on private agricultural lands across the country. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million for CO, an increase from the FY2017 enacted amount ($864 million). The enacted FY2019 appropriation decreases funding for CO below FY2018 levels to $819 million and redirects funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. Other discretionary spending is primarily for watershed programs. The largest—Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO)—was funded at $150 million annually in FY2018 and FY2019. Most mandatory conservation programs are authorized in omnibus farm bills and do not require an annual appropriation. However, Congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) in the annual agricultural appropriations law every year since FY2003. The enacted FY2018 omnibus marks the first appropriation since FY2002 that did not include CHIMPS to mandatory conservation programs. The enacted FY2019 appropriation also does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs, as most programs' authorizations expired on September 30, 2018, making these programs ineligible for reduction. The 2018 farm bill (Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs. While this is infrequent, the Agriculture appropriations bill may also serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs.

{"input": "", "context": "T he Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) authorizes the Department of Labor (DOL) to make grants to support part-time community service employment opportunities for eligible individuals who are age 55 or over and have limited employment prospects. Participation in the program is temporary, with the goal of transitioning participants to unsubsidized employment. In FY2019, appropriations for the SCSEP program were $400 million and supported approximately 41,000 positions. SCSEP appropriations accounted for approximately 20% of total Older Americans Act funding in FY2019. SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended (OAA; 42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.) Since enactment of the OAA, Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times. Most recently, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-144 ) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, and made other changes to the act. Prior to the 2016 OAA reauthorization, the OAA Amendments of 2006 ( P.L. 109-365 ) reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011. Although the authorizations of appropriations under the OAA expired at the end of FY2011, Congress continued to appropriate funding for OAA-authorized activities through FY2016. Grants under the program are administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) at the Department of Labor (DOL). (References to the Secretary in this report refer to the Secretary of Labor, unless otherwise specified.) SCSEP is the only OAA program administered by DOL. Other OAA programs are administered by the Administration for Community Living (ACL) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). SCSEP is supported by discretionary appropriations under the DOL-HHS appropriations bill. SCSEP programs operate on DOL's program year (PY), which operates nine months behind the fiscal year. Activities in a given program year are supported by funding from the corresponding fiscal year. For example, PY2017 ran from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, and was supported by FY2017 appropriations. Programs administered under Title V of the OAA may also be referred to as the Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) programs. DOL uses the CSEOA and SCSEP terminology interchangeably. From its total appropriation, the OAA establishes three reservations: (1) up to 1.5% for DOL-selected pilots, demonstration, and evaluation projects; (2) a fixed percentage of 0.75% for the territories of Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands; and (3) a portion determined by the Secretary for activities that support eligible individuals who are American Indian and Pacific Islander/Asian American. The remaining funds are allocated to formula grants. Title V supports formula grants to both national organizations (\"national grantees\") and state agencies (\"state grantees\"). National grantees are typically nonprofit organizations that operate in more than one state. State grantees are state government agencies. State grantee agencies are typically housed in a state's workforce unit or aging unit. In PY2018, approximately 78% of funds for formula grants ($298 million) were distributed among national grantees. There are about 15-20 national grantee organizations, including AARP and the National Council on Aging. About 22% of PY2018 funds for grants ($84 million) were allocated to state agencies. Both national grantees and state grantees subgrant funds to partner organizations that work with host agencies that provide the actual employment (see Figure 1 ). The OAA specifies that in years where funds available for formula grants exceed the \"funds necessary to maintain the fiscal year 2000 level of activities supported by grantees,\" the excess funds are allotted using a series of formulas that are directly correlated to the number of persons age 55 and over in the state and inversely correlated to the per capita income of the state. Thus, the formulas favor states with larger populations of persons age 55 or over and states with lower per capita incomes. The law contains hold harmless provisions that specify that in years where funds are less than their FY2000 level, funds are awarded proportionately \"to maintain their fiscal year 2000 level of activities.\" The last year in which funds were allocated using the formula was PY2010. Since then, funding for grants has consistently been below the FY2000 level (see Table 1 ). As such, specific grant levels have varied but each state's relative share of grants funds has been proportionate to its FY2000 levels and a consistent share of the funding has been allocated to national grantees in each state as well as each state agency. The OAA defines a state's allotment (and corresponding hold harmless share of funding) as the sum of the allotment for national grants in the state and the grant to the state agency. The proportion of each state's total funding that comes from grants to national organizations versus grants to the state agency varies somewhat. As a condition of receiving SCSEP funds, each state's governor must develop and submit a state plan to DOL. The plan can be an independent document or part of a combined plan with the state's activities under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), the primary federal workforce development legislation authorizing workforce services for the broader population. Whether the SCSEP plan is independent or part of a combined plan, it must provide information on individuals in the state who will be eligible for the program as well as the localities most in need of services. The plan must be developed in consultation with the state WIOA agency, national grantees operating in the state, and other stakeholders. The state plan must describe how the activities under SCSEP will be coordinated with activities under WIOA and how the state will minimize duplication between Title V and WIOA. Grantees that receive funds directly from DOL typically allocate funds to subgrantees and/or host agencies that provide the actual work site placements and part-time community service employment. Host agencies are responsible for recruiting program participants. To be eligible for the program, a prospective participant must be age 55 or older, unemployed, and a member of a family with income of not more than 125% of the poverty level ($15,613 for a family size of one in 2019). Statute specifies that priority will be given to prospective participants who demonstrate additional barriers to employment. Specifically, an individual may receive priority if the individual is 65 years of age or older; has a disability; has limited English proficiency or low literacy skills; resides in a rural area; is a veteran; has low employment prospects; has failed to find employment after utilizing services provided under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act; or is homeless or at risk for homelessness. As is the case with other DOL programs, eligible veterans receive priority of service in the SCSEP program. The OAA allows host agencies to employ program participants part-time in a variety of community service activities, including (but not limited to) social, health, welfare, and educational services as well as conservation and community beautification activities. Some participants may be employed at senior centers and other facets of the Aging Network established by the OAA, such as an Area Agency on Aging. Program participants are paid by the host agency. Participants must earn the highest of (1) the federal minimum wage, (2) the prevailing minimum wage in the state or locality in which the participant works, or (3) the prevailing rate for individuals employed in similar occupations by the same employer. Title V of the OAA does not establish a definition for \"part-time\" and federal policy does not limit the number of hours participants can work. In establishing the cost per authorized position, however, Title V establishes a formula that includes the federal minimum wage \"multiplied by the number of hours equal to the product of 21 hours and 52 weeks.\" As part of program orientation, the subgrantee or host agency is responsible for assessing the participant, including the participant's skills, interests, needs, and potential for unsubsidized employment. Using information from this assessment, the grantee works with the participant to develop an individual employment plan (IEP) that includes a post-service objective (including employment, if appropriate) and the timeline for achievement of that objective. In addition to employment, grantee organizations may also provide training and supportive services. These services can include (but are not limited to) costs of transportation, health and medical services, special job-related or personal counseling, and work-related incidentals such as eyeglasses or work shoes. Individual participants are typically limited to an aggregate maximum of 48 months of participation in the program. Grantees are required to manage programs such that the average duration of participation for all participants does not exceed 27 months. This cap may be increased to an average of 36 months in certain circumstances such as high unemployment in the service area. SCSEP participants are not federal employees. Regulations specify that grantees are responsible for determining whether or not a participant qualifies as an employee of the grantee, subgrantee, or host agency under applicable laws. Grantees must match SCSEP grants such that federal funds account for no more than 90% of the project cost. DOL may waive match requirements in cases of emergency or disaster projects or projects in economically depressed areas. At least 75% of federal grants must be used to pay wages and legally required benefits for program participants. In limited cases, this requirement may be reduced to 65% if the program allocates a certain portion of funds to training and supportive services. In most circumstances, grantees may not use more than 13.5% of their federal grant for administrative expenses. Federal law establishes six core indicators for CSEOA grantees. Three of the six CSEOA indicators focus on unsubsidized employment and earnings after participation in the program. The performance indicators are 1. hours (in the aggregate) of community service employment; 2. the percentage of project participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the project; 3. the percentage of project participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit from the project; 4. the median earnings of project participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the project; 5. indicators of effectiveness in serving employers, host agencies, and project participants; and 6. the number of eligible individuals served, including the number of participating individuals with demonstrated barriers to employment. Indicators 2-4 are largely based on the performance accountability indicators for the general workforce programs under WIOA. Indicators 1, 5, and 6 do not have direct analogues in the WIOA performance accountability system. The current performance accountability measures were established by the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-144 ). Grantees started reporting performance under these metrics beginning in PY2018, starting July 1, 2018. Grantees negotiate expected performance levels with DOL. Negotiating performance levels at the grantee level allows the expected performance levels to reflect the types of participants a particular grantee serves or the environment in which it operates (e.g., the grantee serves a disproportionate number of high-need participants or operates in an area with a high rate of unemployment.) Performance accountability is assessed at the level of the grantee (i.e., the entity that receives funding directly from DOL). Grantees are responsible for oversight of subgrantees and host agencies. Regulations establish that performance is measured as a percentage of the negotiated level of performance. For example, if a grantee negotiates a performance rate of 50% of participants in unsubsidized employment in the second quarter after exit and 48% of the program participants subsequently meet that standard, the grantee has reached 96% of its agreed-upon level of performance. Performance in the range of 80% to 100% constitutes meeting the core level of performance. If a national or state grantee fails to meets its negotiated level of performance, the grantee must receive technical assistance from DOL and submit a corrective action plan. If a national grantee fails to meet expected levels of performance for four consecutive years, the grantee may not compete in the subsequent grant competition. If a state grantee fails to meet the expected levels of performance for three consecutive program years, the state must conduct a competition to award its formula funds to a new grantee. DOL makes available several reports with SCSEP participation data. Data are reported by program year. Reports currently made available by DOL include the following: Aggregate and Individual Performance Reports . These reports include the performance of each national grantee and state agency relative to the negotiated levels of performance. Nationwide Quarterly Progress . These reports include total participation as well as data on demographics and participants' demonstrated barriers to employment. Service to Minority Individuals . These reports include information on the participation and outcomes of minorities for each grantee. The reports are required under Section 515 of the OAA. ", "answers": ["The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) authorizes the Department of Labor (DOL) to make grants to support part-time community service employment opportunities for eligible individuals age 55 or over. In FY2019, appropriations for SCSEP programs were $400 million and supported approximately 41,000 positions. DOL may also refer to the SCSEP program as Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act (OAA). The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019. In FY2019, SCSEP appropriations accounted for about 20% of the funding under the OAA. The bulk of SCSEP appropriations support two primary grant streams: one to national nonprofit organizations and one to state agencies. In the most recent program year, approximately 78% of formula grant funds were allocated to national grantees and about 22% were allocated to state grantees. Both the national organizations and state grantees subgrant funds to host agencies that provide the actual community service employment opportunities to participants. Host agencies are responsible for recruiting eligible participants. To be eligible for the program, prospective participants must be at least age 55, low-income, and unemployed. Federal law requires host agencies to give preference to prospective participants who demonstrate additional barriers to employment such as having a disability or being at risk of homelessness. Program participants work part-time in community service jobs, including employment at schools, libraries, social service organizations, or senior-serving organizations. Program participants earn the higher of minimum wage or the typical wage for the job in which they are employed. An individual may typically participate in the program for a cumulative total of no more than 48 months. During orientation, participants receive an assessment of their skills, interests, capabilities, and needs. This assessment informs the development of an individual employment plan (IEP). A participant's IEP is updated throughout their participation in the program. Grantees are subject to a performance accountability system. Performance metrics generally relate to participants' unsubsidized employment and earnings after exiting the program. In addition to outcome-based metrics, grantees are also assessed on participants' total number of hours of service and whether the grantee served participants with barriers to employment.

{"input": "", "context": "We found in our March 2018 report that, from September 2012 through September 2017, parties accused of patent infringement filed 524 petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board challenging the validity of 359 distinct patents under the CBM program, resulting in rulings against about one-third of these patents. The average monthly number of CBM petitions fluctuated during this period and tapered off over time (see fig. 1). Specifically, during this 5-year period, an average of more than 9 petitions per month were filed under the CBM program, but this average rate declined to fewer than 5 per month in the last fiscal year, with no petitions filed in August or September 2017. Stakeholders we interviewed suggested several possible reasons for the decline in CBM petitions, including recent decisions from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court that clarified which patents are eligible for CBM review; that CBM petitioners successfully targeted the lowest-quality business method patents— patents that should not have been issued because they did not meet the patentability requirements—in the early years of the program, and now those patents have been eliminated; and that owners of business method patents are more wary of asserting their intellectual property through infringement lawsuits and risking its invalidation. Some stakeholders expressed concern about multiple petitions being filed against the same patent. Specifically, stakeholders have suggested that petitioners are, in some cases, using the CBM program and the inter partes review program as tools to increase costs borne by patent owners, and in the case of the CBM program, as a tool to delay district court proceedings. In addition, some stakeholders asserted that this manner of use of the administrative proceedings authorized by the AIA amounts to harassment. However, our analysis of petition data showed that the vast majority of patents challenged under the CBM program were challenged once or twice. Stakeholders we interviewed outlined several reasons why petitioners may file more than one petition against a single patent. For example, the board limits the number of pages that a petitioner may use to submit prior art and arguments for invalidity and therefore some petitioners might file more than one petition so they can present all of their art and arguments at once. Overall, through September 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board had completed reviews of 329 of the 359 patents challenged under the program, and for about one-third of these patents the board ruled at least some challenged patent claims unpatentable. Data on petition outcomes are open to different interpretations depending on how they are presented. For example, under the CBM program, board judges ruled some or all of the patent claims considered at trial unpatentable in 96.7 percent of the petitions for which they issued a final written decision from September 2012 through September 2017. On the basis of this statistic, the board could seem to invalidate the majority of the patents it reviews, as noted by some stakeholders. However, this outcome is predictable given the criteria for accepting, or instituting, a CBM trial—a judge panel will institute a petition to the trial phase if it is “more likely than not” that at least one of the claims challenged in a petition is unpatentable—which tips outcomes for instituted petitions toward rulings of unpatentability. In addition, board judges do not issue final written decisions for all petitions that enter the trial phase because the parties often reach a settlement before the final written decision. When taking into account all of the CBM petitions that had an outcome as of September 30, 2017, board judges ruled some or all of the claims considered at trial unpatentable in 35.6 percent of the cases. We found in our March 2018 report that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board has completed all trials under AIA-authorized proceedings within statutorily directed time frames, according to board data, and the board has taken steps to review issues that could affect the consistency of its trial proceedings and decisions and to engage with stakeholders to improve its proceedings. Board officials we interviewed told us the timeliness of decisions to institute a trial and of final written decisions has not been a concern in the 5 years that the board has operated. According to board officials, as of November 2017, two AIA trials—one under the inter partes review program and one under the CBM program—have been extended, for good cause, past the typical 1-year time limit between the institution decision and the final written decision, as allowed by statute. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has decision review processes that help ensure trial decisions are reviewed as appropriate, but the board cannot ensure the consistency of its trial decisions because it does not have guidance for reviewing the decisions or the processes that lead to them. For trials still in progress, board officials told us there are several ways management gets involved in reviews—including reviews of ongoing trials if and when a paneled judge raises any issue deserving of management attention. Such issues are brought to the attention of the chief judge or other members of the board’s management team and are acted upon at their discretion. Board officials also told us that a separate internal review process has evolved over time, whereby a small group of board judges, in consultation with board management, seeks to ensure decision quality and consistency by reading a large number of draft AIA trial decisions and giving feedback or suggestions to authoring judges prior to issuance. In addition, the board reviews any AIA trial decisions that are appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the appeals court subsequently reverses or remands. Finally, board officials told us that the board has begun to increase the number of trial decisions considered for precedential and informative designations as part of its efforts to ensure the consistency of trial decisions. Taken together, the board’s review processes help ensure that board trial decisions are reviewed in some manner. However, because the board does not have documented procedures for how to review decisions for consistency, the board cannot fully ensure the consistency of the decisions or the processes that lead to them. Under federal standards for internal control, management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Such control activities include clearly documenting internal control in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. The documentation may appear in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals. We recommended that the Director of USPTO develop guidance, such as documented procedures, for judges reviewing the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decisions and the processes that lead to the decisions. USPTO agreed with our recommendation and stated that it has begun taking actions to address it. In addition, to improve various aspects of its trial proceedings, the board has taken several steps to engage with stakeholders. USPTO’s strategic plan states that the board should expand outreach to stakeholders by providing opportunities for interaction and updates on board operations and other important issues. The board has done so through several types of public outreach efforts, including participating in roundtables, webinars, and judicial conferences, among other activities. The board has made several changes to policies and procedures based on stakeholder feedback gathered through these mechanisms. Stakeholders we interviewed for our March 2018 report generally agreed the CBM program has reduced litigation involving business method patents because the CBM program allows these patents to be more easily challenged than in district courts, and many stakeholders said there is value in maintaining some aspects of the program. Stakeholders told us that fewer business method patent lawsuits are filed and that existing lawsuits are often dropped after patents have been through the CBM program. However, stakeholders also noted that the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l has contributed to the reduced number of business method patent lawsuits. Stakeholders told us that the CBM program has made it riskier to assert business method patents because, compared with district court, the program offers a cheaper and more efficient way for alleged infringers to challenge a patent’s validity. In addition, according to stakeholders, patent owners are more focused on asserting business method patents that are higher quality and less vulnerable to challenge either under the CBM program or based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Alice; these are patents that describe a technological invention that is not abstract and implemented on a generic computer. Stakeholders we interviewed generally agreed the effects of the CBM program on innovation and investment have been minimal or mostly positive. More specifically, stakeholders told us that the CBM program is good for overall innovation and investment in financial technologies in that the program eliminates overly broad (non-specific), low-quality patents. Stakeholders told us they believe the existence and assertion of overly broad patents is bad for innovation, in part because defending against alleged infringement is expensive and time-consuming, even under the CBM program. Assertion of overly broad, unclear, or otherwise low-quality patents acts much like a tax on investment, according to stakeholders. Stakeholders also told us that removing such patents from the marketplace promotes innovation because it prevents these patents from blocking new innovation. According to stakeholders, innovation is represented by the quality of the patents issued rather than the quantity. A large number of patents in a technology space, according to stakeholders, can make it difficult to innovate within that crowded space. Most stakeholders told us there was value in maintaining aspects of the CBM program, including the ability to challenge patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on all four patentability requirements—subject matter; novelty; non-obviousness; and clarity and specificity. Stakeholders we interviewed pointed to inconsistencies in how federal courts interpret subject matter eligibility and clarity requirements, in particular. Stakeholders said that the federal courts and jurors do not necessarily have the expertise to interpret requirements for subject matter eligibility and clarity, and that the technically trained Patent Trial and Appeal Board judges were better suited to make patentability determinations on these grounds. Stakeholders generally agreed that the ability to challenge a patent’s validity on subject matter eligibility grounds remains important, although there was not broad agreement among stakeholders regarding how far that ability should extend beyond business method patents. Some stakeholders said subject matter eligibility challenges were important for a wider scope of patents than just business methods because concerns about subject matter eligibility that apply to business method patents extend to software-related patents in general. Similarly, stakeholders told us that patent clarity problems exist beyond business method patents.

The CBM program provides entities facing infringement lawsuits an opportunity to challenge the validity of a business method patent by demonstrating that it did not meet requirements for patentability. Business method patents focus on ways of doing business in areas such as banking or e-commerce. The rate of filing petitions over this period has fluctuated but has generally declined since 2015, and none were filed in August or September 2017. USPTO has taken several steps to ensure the timeliness of trial decisions, review past decisions, and engage with stakeholders to improve proceedings under the program: Timeliness: USPTO regularly informs relevant parties about paperwork requirements and due dates throughout trials.

{"input": "", "context": "Countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) remains a U.S. national security priority. According to the 2017 National Security Strategy, terrorist groups continue to pursue WMD-related materials, which pose a grave danger to the United States. As also stated in the 2017 National Security Strategy, Russia’s nuclear arsenal remains the most existential threat to the United States, China’s nuclear arsenal is growing and diversifying, Iran has the potential of renewing its nuclear program and North Korea has pursued nuclear weapons despite international commitments. As the DSB report noted, U.S. monitoring abilities are increasingly challenged by evolving risks in 1) the capability of existing nuclear states and 2) the number of state and nonstate actors possessing or attempting to possess nuclear weapons. U.S. nonproliferation activities are conducted and coordinated across multiple government agencies and organizations, as well as the intelligence community. In addition, these efforts are coordinated with international entities, national laboratories, industry, and academia. U.S. nuclear nonproliferation verification and monitoring efforts are guided by, among other things, U.S. obligations under the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and U.S. support for the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The NPT lays out the respective responsibilities of nuclear-weapon and nonnuclear-weapon states with regard to the transfer, acquisition, possession, control, and manufacture of nuclear weapons. All nonnuclear-weapon states are required to have a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to facilitate IAEA’s safeguards activities. IAEA safeguards are a set of technical measures and activities by which IAEA seeks to verify that nuclear material subject to safeguards is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes. Under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which has yet to enter into force, parties agree not to carry out any nuclear explosions. The United States supports the work of the CTBTO to build up a verification regime in preparation for the treaty’s entry into force. The Administration’s fiscal year 2018 plan for verification and monitoring described ongoing interagency efforts to support nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring and includes information about relevant national priorities, capability gaps, R&D initiatives, and roles and responsibilities. The 2018 plan (40 pages) is longer and more detailed than the 2015 plan (2 pages) or the 2017 update (4 pages). The bulk of the 2018 plan is contained in two chapters—one chapter broadly describes U.S. and international efforts and roles and responsibilities, and the other chapter describes ongoing U.S. R&D efforts. We found the Administration’s 2018 plan provided details on each of the four major reporting requirements called for in the fiscal year 2018 NDAA with the exception of future costs and funding needs (see table 1). The first reporting requirement called for a plan and roadmap for verification, detection, and monitoring with respect to policy, operations, and research, development, testing, and evaluation, including— Identifying requirements for verification, detection, and monitoring; Identifying and integrating roles, responsibilities, and planning for verification, detection, and monitoring activities; and The costs and funding requirements over 10 years for these activities. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on verification, detection, and monitoring requirements and roles and responsibilities, but did not provide details on future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. We found that the plan identified requirements for verification, detection, and monitoring as required. To identify these requirements, the plan notes that interagency partners first identified a set of verification and monitoring priorities. From these priorities they identified a number of technical gaps. The plan then described dozens of examples of R&D efforts and non-technical activities to address those technical gaps. For example, for one gap the plan identifies eight current efforts to address this gap, including continued Department of Energy and NNSA investment in sensor capabilities that are small, light, and can operate in low power. We found that the plan provided details on the requirement to identify and integrate roles and responsibilities and planning. The plan includes details of the roles and responsibilities of interagency partners and international bodies that cooperate in the nonproliferation realm. For example, the plan describes how the Department of Defense is to support U.S. verification activities under the CTBT, including the installation, operation, and maintenance of U.S. International Monitoring Systems. We found that the plan did not identify costs and funding needs over a 10- year period. NNSA officials stated that they believed providing funding information over a 10-year period is unrealistic for several reasons. First, according to NNSA officials, it is not feasible to achieve agreement on actual or implied budgets outside of the existing President’s budget process. Second, according to NNSA officials, agencies have little influence over the funding priorities of other departments outside of existing budget efforts. Third, according to NNSA officials, long-term funding estimates are infeasible because the President’s budget only identifies funding levels five years into the future. However, the 2018 NDAA did not ask for budget information. Instead, the NDAA reporting requirement called for long-term costs and funding information necessary to support the verification and monitoring activities in the plan. Finally, NNSA officials told us that they and officials from other agencies briefed the appropriate congressional committees prior to the release of the 2018 plan, and discussed the challenges with providing cost and funding data. According to NNSA officials, they verified with the congressional committees that providing such information in the plan would be impractical. We have previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs. NNSA as well as other agencies within the federal government already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates. For example, in June 2014, we reported on 10-year estimates for sustaining and modernizing U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities. As we found in this and other reports, even when budgets are preliminary or not yet known, plans that include a range of potential estimates help Congress prioritize projects and funding. Because the plan does not include any information on interagency costs and funding needs, it limits 1) congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation’s verification and monitoring efforts and 2) Congress’s ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort. In addition, including estimates of future costs and funding needs in the plan can help ensure that interagency partners understand the amount of resources necessary to support verification and monitoring efforts, and determine if these resources align with agency activities. We have previously reported on the importance of identifying resources among collaborating agencies; we noted that without information on resource contributions from partners in a collaborative effort, there is less assurance that agency contributions are appropriate to successfully sustain the effort. Similarly, providing information on future costs and funding needs is important to help interagency partners coordinate and develop long-term strategic plans that align with future interagency efforts. We have found that for strategic planning to be done well, plans should demonstrate alignment between activities, core processes, and resources that support mission outcome. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources for interagency efforts and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. The second reporting requirement called for an international engagement plan for building cooperation and transparency—including bilateral and multilateral efforts—to improve inspections, detection, and monitoring activities. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on this requirement. The 2018 plan reiterates the nation’s commitment to the NPT and includes information on IAEA’s safeguards programs and U.S support for those programs. For example, under the plan, interagency partners are to continue to encourage countries through diplomatic outreach to conclude Additional Protocol agreements with IAEA. The third reporting requirement called for the plan to describe current and planned R&D efforts toward improving monitoring, detection, and in-field inspection and analysis capabilities, including persistent surveillance, remote monitoring, and rapid analysis of large data sets; and measures to coordinate technical and operational requirements early in the process. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on this requirement. The plan includes detail on a wide range of R&D efforts and non-technical efforts that agencies are pursuing. For example, the plan reports that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is starting a program that models millions of nodes and billions of connections to support the detection of WMD proliferation activities. In addition, the plan describes interagency groups involved in coordinating R&D requirements, such as the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Nuclear Defense Research and Development. The fourth reporting requirement called for the plan to describe the engagement of relevant federal departments and agencies; the military departments; national laboratories; industry; and academia. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on this requirement. The plan includes detail on the roles and responsibilities for interagency partners, as well as information on interagency organizations and working groups to coordinate efforts and reduce duplication. For example, the plan discusses the Department of State’s efforts to lead the interagency policy process on nonproliferation and manage global U.S. security policy, and the Department of Defense’s support of U.S. diplomatic efforts, including agreements with other defense departments, R&D cooperation, and multinational exercises. This 2018 plan represents the third effort by Administrations to address the nation’s nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring efforts. The 2018 plan provides more detail on these efforts than the 2015 plan and 2017 update. However, the plan does not include estimates of future costs and funding needs as required by the fiscal year 2018 NDAA. Costs and funding information can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify potential long-term funding needs. Similarly, costs and funding information helps interagency partners understand what resources they are expected to contribute in the future and helps to ensure long-term strategic plans reflect an alignment between resources and interagency activities. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort and interagency activities, and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. We are making the following recommendation to NNSA: The Administrator of NNSA should include in its plan for verification and monitoring estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. (Recommendation 1) We provided NNSA with a draft of this report for review and comment. NNSA provided written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in appendix I; the agency neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation to include estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in its plan for nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring. However, NNSA stated that it planned no further action with regard to costs and funding data. NNSA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. NNSA stated that it appreciated our recognition of improvements in the 2018 plan for verification and monitoring over the 2015 plan and the 2017 update. In its written comments, NNSA acknowledged that it did not include interagency cost and funding requirements in the 2018 plan over 10 years as required in the NDAA. The agency stated that it briefed the appropriate congressional committees before the release of the plan about the challenges and feasibility of providing the cost and funding data and received no objections on the omission of the data from the plan. NNSA also stated that it informed us of the briefings. We have added clarification in our report that NNSA officials believed they received agreement from congressional staff to exclude funding and cost estimates from its plan. NNSA stated that the NDAA did not prioritize the relative importance of the reporting requirements, and that we disproportionately weighted the one omission in our assessment, effectively overstating the importance of providing cost and funding information. In addition, NNSA identified challenges to the feasibility of providing interagency out-year cost and funding estimates, including the difficulty to quantify the level of R&D and associated funding required to achieve specific outcomes and that departments and agencies are unable to commit to aligning 10 year funding estimates with individual agencies’ timelines and internal processes for planning, programming, budgeting, and execution. NNSA’s statement suggests that it views nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring programs as being unique and different from other federal programs and that they should therefore be exempt from estimating their potential long-term resource burden on the federal budget. We disagree. Developing future cost and funding estimates for programs is central to effective interagency planning efforts. The efforts described in NNSA’s 2018 nuclear verification and monitoring plan span a diverse range of activities that are implemented across multiple agencies. The absence of cost and funding estimates for these efforts in NNSA’s plan raises questions as to whether there is an effective interagency process to coordinate these efforts and if the process is taking adequate account of resource constraints and making realistic assessments of program resource needs. In addition, information on future cost and funding estimates of federal programs provides Congress with a better understanding of the potential long-term funding needs and costs of the diverse efforts supporting the proliferation verification and monitoring mission. We believe this big picture view is important given the multiple congressional committees of jurisdiction—including appropriations, authorization, and oversight committees—for the efforts identified in NNSA’s plan. Regarding the feasibility of providing 10-year cost and funding estimates, we recognize the difficulty and uncertainty agencies face in estimating future funding needs. However, we do not believe developing such estimates is impossible. As we reported, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) prepare an annual plan with 10 year cost and funding estimates for their ongoing nuclear sustainment and modernization efforts, including R&D efforts. NNSA also provided general technical comments addressing our findings on the cost and funding estimates that were not included in the plan, including comments on NNSA’s authority to obtain 10-year estimates from other agencies, and on the examples we cited of other interagency plans that include similar estimates. NNSA stated that it did not have authority to require other agencies to submit 10-year budget estimates for their efforts that are included in the plan. We noted in our report that Congress directed the President to include this element in the nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring plan. However, responsibility to prepare and submit the plan was delegated by the President to DOE. NNSA commented that the joint DOD-DOE annual nuclear sustainment and modernization plan is not comparable to the NNSA plan because the former primarily addresses capital projects and other material products, while the latter primarily addresses R&D activities. The reporting requirements for NNSA’s nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring plan were not limited to R&D efforts, but included cost and funding estimates for related activities and capabilities, including policy, operations, testing, and evaluation. NNSA’s comment focuses only on the difficulty of addressing cost and funding estimates for only one aspect (R&D) of nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring and ignores the possibility that estimates for non-R&D efforts may be more feasible and less difficult to report. Moreover, we have reported that the joint DOD- DOE plan on nuclear modernization includes 10-year DOD and DOE estimates for R&D, as well as estimates for related modernization efforts, including infrastructure, nuclear weapon life extension programs, delivery systems, nuclear command, control, and communications systems, and other related activities.

To help address these issues, Congress directed the Administration in 2015 and 2017 to develop a plan for verification and monitoring relating to the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons, components of such weapons, and fissile material. GAO reviewed the first plan submitted to Congress in 2015, and an update submitted in 2017. GAO reported in March 2018 that this plan and update generally did not address the congressionally mandated reporting requirements. In the fiscal year 2018 NDAA, Congress directed the Administration to develop another plan and included a provision for GAO to review the plan. This report assesses whether the Administration's new plan provided details on the reporting requirements included in the NDAA. To determine whether the plan provided details on the reporting requirements, GAO reviewed the fiscal year 2018 plan and assessed whether the plan included details for each of the elements as required by the NDAA. GAO found that the 2018 plan provided details on most of the reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018, but did not include information on future costs and funding needs (see table below). In the NDAA, Congress directed the President to produce a plan that would address four reporting requirements: (1) a plan and roadmap on verification, detection and monitoring efforts, including details on costs and funding needs over 10 years, (2) an international engagement plan, (3) a research and development plan, and (4) a description of interagency engagement. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy, developed the plan and submitted it to Congress in April 2018. According to NNSA officials, NNSA did not include long-term costs and funding needs in the plan because identifying these needs is unrealistic for several reasons, including because agencies have little influence over the spending priorities of other departments outside of the President's budget process. However, NNSA and other agencies already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates for other programs. Because the plan does not include any estimates on future costs and funding needs, it limits congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation's verification and monitoring efforts and its ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. GAO has previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. GAO recommends that the Administrator of NNSA should include in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation, but said it planned no further action. GAO maintains that the recommendation is valid."], "length": 3249, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0fd7e5a78ef1d4399385aba1b8d4bdbacb27592752b4c6f9"}
{"input": "", "context": "The President's budget for FY2020 consists of a multivolume set of materials issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The materials contain information on new budget proposals, summ ary tables, detailed financial information on individual programs and accounts, economic analysis, historical data, explanations of the budget processes, and supporting documents. Every year the President submits these materials to Congress at the start of the budget cycle for the next fiscal year. The President's submission is required on or after the first Monday in January, but no later than the first Monday in February (31 U.S.C. §1105(a)). However, incoming presidential Administrations do not generally release multivolume budget sets in February. This year the President released the budget submission, in two installments, on March 11, and March 18, 2019. Other budget-related documents include the annual Economic Report of the President , issued by the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Budget and Economic Outlook , an annual publication issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Details on these publications are included in this report. Both OMB and the Government Publishing Office (GPO) provide internet access to the main and supporting budget documents, spreadsheet files, the public budget database, and budget amendments and supplementals proposed by the President; see http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget and https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BUDGET , respectively. OMB provides additional summary table information on agency budgets and key issues in the form of fact sheets, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fact-sheets/ . Information on purchasing print copies of these documents appears below, along with a brief description of the contents of each document. The annual budget volume contains information, charts, and graphs pertaining to the President's new budget proposals and overviews of government activities by topic (e.g., \"Modernizing Government\" and \"A Budget for a Better American\") within the FY2020 Budget volume. Summary Tables (pp. 105-139) contain projections of budget baselines, receipts, and outlays; deficits; debt; discretionary spending; and economic projections from FY2019 to FY2029.

Some data files are also included in spreadsheet format. The CD-ROM provides software to search, display, and print. (GPO stock number and ordering information not yet available) This volume includes economic, accounting, and crosscutting analyses of government programs and activities designed to highlight specific subject areas. It also includes information on federal receipts and collections, analysis of federal spending, detailed information on federal borrowing and debt, baseline or current service estimates, and other technical presentations. Chapter 17, \"Aid to State and Local Governments,\" contains a series of tables (pp. 231-247) that provide selected grant and other federal assistance data by state. The FY2020 Analytical Perspectives volume contains supplemental materials including tables showing the budget by agency and account and by function, subfunction, and program. The supplemental materials also include data on direct and guaranteed loan transactions of the federal government. The supplemental material is available on a CD-ROM, in the printed document, or on the GPO website at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BUDGET . (GPO stock number 041-001-00732-6, $52, 360 pages) Designed primarily for the use of the House and Senate appropriations committees, the Appendix contains more detailed financial information on individual programs and appropriations accounts than any of the other budget documents submitted by the President. In many presidential budget submissions, the volume often provides the following information for agencies: proposed text of the appropriation language, budget schedules for each account, new legislative proposals, explanations of the work to be performed and the funds needed, and proposed general provisions applicable to the appropriations of entire agencies or groups of agencies. Typically, elements within this information are distinguished by varying font, so that, for example, proposed appropriations (italics) and prior year funding (brackets and no italics) can be compared at a glance: For expenses necessary for the administration of the Department of Justice, [$111,500,000] $125,896,000 , of which not to exceed $4,000,000 for security and construction of Department of Justice facilities shall remain available until expended.

(GPO stock number 041-001-00733-4, $82, 1,3 20 pages) These detailed tables cover budget deficit/surplus, outlays, receipts, discretionary and mandatory spending, federal debt, federal employment, payments for individuals, spending by function and agency, and grants to states and local governments. These tables provide some data from 1940 (or earlier) and estimates through FY2024. Historical data are adjusted by OMB to be consistent with data in the FY2020 budget and to provide comparability over time. This year the Historical Tables are available online in spreadsheet and PDF instead of print. The Historical Tables are available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/ . This year's annual Economic Report of the President was submitted by the Council of Economic Advisers and transmitted to Congress in March 2019. It presents the Administration's economic policies and contains the annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers. It also presents an overview of the nation's economic progress using text and extensive data appendices. Appendix B of the Economic Report includes current and historical statistics on major aspects of economic activity (pp. 625-705). Statistics include national income and expenditures, government finance, population, employment, wages, productivity, prices, debt measures, corporate finance, and international statistics.

The FY2020 document is not currently available, but should be available in the summer on the OMB website . (GPO stock number and ordering information not yet available) After the President's budget documents are released, Congress begins to hold hearings on agency budget requests. Agencies must submit their budget justifications to the appropriations subcommittees holding the hearings. Budget justifications generally contain more detailed descriptions of an agency's proposals and programs than are provided in the President's budget documents. As mandated by OMB in Section 22.6 of the 2006 edition of Circular A-11 and subsequent editions, executive agencies are required to post their congressional budget justification materials on the internet within two weeks of transmittal to Congress. Typically, Administration budget requests appear along with actual numbers for the previous fiscal year. The content and structure of these submissions may vary and some materials may not correspond exactly with the data and information provided to Congress in other fiscal years. A short overview on the agency budget justification request can be found within CRS Report RS20268, Agency Justification of the President's Budget , by Michelle D. Christensen. OMB produces a number of additional documents that further examines certain budgetary categories, including the Federal Credit Supplement , which provides summary information on certain federal loan and loan guarantee programs through a series of detailed tables; Object Class Analysis , a report on the federal government's obligations as broken out by object classifications; and Balances of Budget Authority , which provides data on unobligated balances carried forward to the start of the next fiscal year. All three documents are available online at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/supplemental-materials/ . OMB also maintains a publicly accessible database in Excel and comma delimited format called the Public Budget Database .

{"input": "", "context": "The attrition among VHA physicians has been of particular concern given that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) anticipates that by 2025 the national demand for physician services will exceed supply. HRSA’s Office of Rural Health Policy reported, in 2017, that physician shortages were exacerbated in rural areas, where communities struggle to attract and keep well-trained providers. This difficulty has posed a particular challenge for VHA, as approximately one in four VAMCs is located in a rural area. Most physicians providing care at VAMCs are employed by VHA. VHA also supplements the capacity of its employed physician staff by acquiring additional physician services through fee-basis arrangements or contracts. Under fee-basis arrangements, providers are paid a pre- agreed-upon amount for each service provided. Under contracts, physician services may be obtained on a short-term basis; for example, through sole-source contracts with academic affiliates. VAMCs may also use physicians who volunteer their time, who are referred to as work- without-compensation providers. In addition to VHA-employed, contract, and fee-basis physicians, VAMCs often supplement their capacity by using physician trainees, who include medical residents and advanced fellows. In 2016, 135 of the 170 VAMCs had active physician training programs. According to VHA officials, there were 43,768 medical residents who trained at a VAMC in 2016. VHA has been expanding its physician training program, as directed by the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, as amended. In 2017, VHA added 175 physician trainee positions across VAMCs nationwide, including 3 VAMCs that did not have physician trainees prior to this expansion. VHA’s objective is to add 953 additional physician trainee positions to its VAMCs by 2025 in order to improve access and hire additional physicians. Further, VHA officials told us they want to continue to add new positions that would eventually allow all VAMCs access to physician trainees. In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA’s data on physicians who provided care at VAMCs were incomplete. Specifically, we found that VHA had data on the number of mission-critical physicians it employed (more than 11,000) and who provided services on a fee-basis (about 2,800), but lacked data on the number of contract physicians and physician trainees. As a result, VHA did not have data on the extent to which VAMCs used these arrangements and thus, underestimated its physician use overall. Therefore, VHA was unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed any gaps in staffing. All six VAMCs included in our review used at least one type of arrangement other than employment for physicians, and five of the six used contract physicians or physician trainees. (See fig. 1.) On average, contract and fee-basis physicians made up 5 to 40 percent of the physicians in a given mission-critical physician occupation at each VAMC in our review. For example, officials from a large, highly complex VAMC told us that, in March 2017, they augmented the 86 employed primary care physicians with eight contract and three fee-basis physicians, which represented about 16 percent of their primary care physician workforce. Further, this VAMC also had about 64 primary care physician trainees providing certain medical services under the supervision of a senior physician. During the course of our work for the October 2017 report, VHA officials told us that its personnel databases were designed to manage VHA’s payroll systems, but that these databases did not contain information on contract physicians or physician trainees. VHA officials told us they were working to include information on physician trainees in a new human resources (HR) database—HR Smart—which at the time of our review, was scheduled to be implemented in 2017. However, these officials were not aware of plans to add information to the database on contract physicians. Instead, VAMC leaders used locally devised methods to identify and track contract physicians, fee-basis physicians, and physician trainees. For example, one VAMC in our October 2017 review used a locally maintained spreadsheet to track its physicians under arrangements other than employment, while another VAMC asked department leaders to identify how many of these provided care within their respective departments. At each of the six VAMCs in our review, we found that department leaders were generally knowledgeable about the total number of physicians that provided care within the departments they managed. However, this locally maintained information was not readily accessible by VHA officials. To address the limitations in VHA’s data, we recommended in our October 2017 report that VHA develop and implement a process to accurately count all physicians providing care at each of its VAMCs, including physicians not employed by VHA. VHA did not concur with this recommendation, stating that it uses other tools for workforce planning. However, a VHA official acknowledged that data sources used for workforce planning may not include all types of contract physicians or work-without-compensation physicians. As we discussed in our prior report, implementing such a systematic process would eliminate the need for individual VAMCs to use their own mechanisms, such as a locally developed and maintained spreadsheet to track its physician workforce, as was done by one VAMC in our prior review. Further, local mechanisms may not be readily accessible to VHA officials engaged in workforce planning, resulting in incomplete information for decision-making purposes. Since our report, VHA officials told us that they have completed implementation of HR Smart, which provides the capability to track every position with a unique position number, and each employee’s full employment history. However, VHA officials told us they do not plan to enhance the capability of HR Smart to track contractors. We continue to believe that having a systematic and consistent process to account for all physicians who provide care across VAMCs, including physicians not employed by VHA, would help address concerns that VHA is unable to identify all physicians providing care at its VAMCs. In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA gave responsibility for determining staffing needs to its VAMCs and provided its facilities with guidance, through policies and directives, on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician occupations. Specifically, VHA provided this guidance for primary care, mental health, and emergency medicine, but lacked sufficient guidance for its medical and surgical specialties, including occupations such as gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery. For these occupations, VHA provided guidance on the minimum number of physicians, but did not provide information on how to determine appropriate staffing levels for physicians or support staff based on the need for care. Specifically, the VHA guidance available at the time set a minimum requirement that VAMCs of a certain complexity level have at least one gastroenterologist and one orthopedic surgeon that is available within 15 minutes by phone or 60 minutes in person 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. VHA guidance did not include information on how to use data, such as workload data, to manage the demand for care or help inform staffing levels for these physician occupations beyond this minimum requirement. Officials from four of the six VAMCs we reviewed for our October 2017 report told us that because they lacked (1) guidance on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed, and (2) data on how their staffing levels compared with those of similar VAMCs, they were sometimes unsure whether their staffing levels were adequate. In our October 2017 report, we discussed that VHA had previously established, in 2016, a specialty physician staffing workgroup that examined the relationships between staffing levels, provider workload and productivity, veterans’ access, and cost across VAMCs for its medical and surgical specialties, including gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery. This group’s work culminated in a January 2017 report that found VHA was unable to assess and report on the staffing at each VAMC, as required by the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, because a staffing model for specialty care had not been established and applied across VAMCs. This report made a number of recommendations, including that VHA provide guidance to its VAMCs on what level of staffing is appropriate for its mission-critical physician occupations. However, as we noted in our October 2017 report, VHA leadership had not yet taken steps to develop such staffing guidance. We reported that, according to a VHA official, other priorities were taking precedence and continued work in this area had not yet been approved by VHA leadership. Although VHA officials agreed that further steps should be taken, they did not indicate when these would occur. In our report, we concluded that until VHA issues guidance on staffing levels for certain physician occupations that provide specialty care to veterans, there would continue to be ambiguity for VAMCs on how to determine appropriate staffing levels. To address this, we recommended that VHA develop and issue guidance to VAMCs on determining appropriate staffing levels for all mission-critical physician occupations. VHA concurred with our recommendation and reported it would evaluate and develop staffing guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. Since our report, VHA officials told us that on November 27, 2017, the Executive-in-Charge for VHA signed the specialty care workgroup charter. The primary goal of the workgroup is to develop a specialty care staffing model that will include staffing information for all specialty care. VHA anticipates completing its work and issuing staffing guidance by December 2018. In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA used various strategies to recruit and retain its physician workforce, including providing assistance recruiting for mission-critical physician occupations through the National Recruitment Program; policies and guidance; financial incentives to enhance hiring and retention offers; and a national physician training program. (See table 1.) In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA faced challenges using its strategies for recruiting and retaining physicians. For example, according to VHA officials, budget shortfalls in the Education Debt Reduction Program—which reimburses qualifying education loan debt for employees, including physicians, in hard-to-recruit positions—reduced VAMCs’ ability to offer this recruitment incentive to physician candidates. In addition, the relatively small number of physician recruiters in VHA’s National Recruitment Program—19 recruiters for the 170 VAMCs at the time of our report—limited their ability to understand the particular nuances of some markets, particularly in rural areas. Further, despite VHA’s large and expanding graduate medical training program, VAMCs experienced difficulties hiring physicians who received training through its residency and fellowship programs. VHA did not track the number of physician trainees who were hired following graduation, but officials told us that the number was small in comparison to the almost 44,000 physician trainees educated at VAMCs each year. We found that VAMCs faced challenges hiring physician trainees, in part, because VHA did not share information on graduating physician trainees for recruitment purposes with VAMCs across the system. VHA officials told us that recruitment efforts could be improved by developing and maintaining a database of physician trainees, but said that VHA had no such database. According to VHA officials, information sharing could help both VAMCs in geographically remote locations that do not have a residency program and help identify trainees who want to work at VHA after graduating, but who received no offers from the VAMC they trained at due to the lack of vacancies in their specialty. We also reported in October 2017 that VHA did not have complete information on whether its recruitment and retention strategies were meeting its needs. VHA had gathered feedback on barriers VAMCs face when offering financial incentives to physician candidates through its Education Debt Reduction Program and created a workgroup to look at its overall use of physician retention strategies, although it had not completed a comprehensive review of its recruitment and retention strategies to identify any areas for improvement. As a result, VHA did not have complete information on the underlying causes of the difficulties VAMCs faced or whether its recruitment and retention strategies met its objective of having a robust physician workforce to meet the health care needs of veterans. To address these issues, we recommended that VHA (1) establish a system-wide method to share information about physician trainees to help fill vacancies across VAMCs, and (2) conduct a comprehensive, system- wide evaluation of its physician recruitment and retention efforts, and establish an ongoing monitoring program. VHA concurred with our recommendations, and reported it planned to enhance its personnel database, HR Smart, to include physician trainees. Additionally, VHA said it planned to complete a comprehensive, system-wide evaluation of the physician recruitment and retention strategies. Since our report, VHA reported taking some steps to address these recommendations. Specifically, officials told us they are working to include information in the newly implemented HR Smart database on work-without-compensation employees, such as physician trainees, and anticipate conducting pilot projects at various sites before fully implementing this capability by September 30, 2019. Additionally, officials said that they are in the process of completing a review of physician recruitment and retention incentives. Furthermore, according to VHA officials, beginning in October 2017, VHA’s Office of Workforce Management and Consulting partnered with the Partnered Evidence- based Policy Resource Center—an internal VHA resource center—to evaluate and recommend a systematic approach for allocating workforce management resources, such as the Education Debt Reduction Program. VHA expects to complete its efforts by September 2018. Chairman Dunn, Ranking Member Brownley, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my statement.

Physicians—who provide and supervise a broad range of care including primary and specialty care—serve an integral role in VHA's mission. Certain physician types are consistently among the most difficult to recruit and retain, and are thus considered mission-critical by VHA. Over the past two decades, GAO and others have expressed concern about VHA's ability to ensure that it has the appropriate clinical workforce, including physicians, to meet the current and future needs of veterans. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report and examines (1) VHA information on how many mission critical physicians provided care at VAMCs, (2) VHA guidance for determining its physician staffing needs, and (3) the strategies VHA used to support the recruitment and retention of physicians at VAMCs, and the extent to which it has evaluated these strategies to determine their effectiveness. For this statement, GAO updated the information from its October 2017 report and obtained information from VHA officials in June 2018 about steps they have taken to implement the 2017 recommendations. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continues to face challenges related to physician staffing, recruitment, and retention, though it has begun work to implement recommendations made in GAO's October 2017 report. Specifically, GAO's report found the following: VHA's data on the number of physicians that provided care at VA medical centers (VAMC) were incomplete. GAO found that data were incomplete because they did not include data on the number of contract physicians and contained only limited data on the number of physician trainees—two types of physicians that augment the care provided by physicians employed by VHA. Thus, VHA data underestimated the total number of physicians providing care in its medical centers leaving it unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed gaps in staffing. GAO recommended that VHA implement a process to accurately count all its physicians. VHA did not concur with this recommendation, stating that it used other tools for workforce planning. VHA has since implemented a new human resources (HR) database—HR Smart—that has the capability to track each position at its VAMCs. However, VHA officials told us they do not plan to include information on physician contractors in this database. VHA provided VAMCs with guidance on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician occupations, although it lacked sufficient guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. GAO recommended that VHA issue guidance to VAMCs on determining appropriate staffing levels for all physicians. VHA concurred and reported it would develop staffing guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. VHA officials told GAO VHA signed a specialty care workgroup charter November 27, 2017; the primary goal of the workgroup was to develop a specialty care staffing model that would include staffing information for all specialty care. VHA anticipates completing its work and issuing staffing guidance by December 2018. VHA used various strategies to recruit and retain its physician workforce, but had not comprehensively evaluated them to assess effectiveness . Without such an evaluation, VHA did not have complete information on the underlying causes of the difficulties VAMCs face, or whether its recruitment and retention strategies were meeting physician workforce needs. GAO recommended VHA (1) establish a system-wide method to share information about physician trainees to help fill vacancies across VAMCs and (2) conduct a comprehensive, system-wide evaluation of VAMCs' physician recruitment and retention efforts and establish an ongoing monitoring program. VHA concurred and reported it has since taken steps to address the recommendations. For example, VHA's Office of Workforce Management and Consulting has partnered with its Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center to evaluate and recommend a systematic approach for allocating workforce management resources. In addition, VHA has added the capability to track physician trainees to its HR Smart database. VHA expects to complete its efforts by September 2018 and September 2019, respectively."], "length": 3035, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "889aa95bee30658d255d24483adc4d76a24f1aecce806a61"}
{"input": "", "context": "RPS are long-lived sources of spacecraft electrical power and heating that are rugged, compact, highly reliable, and relatively insensitive to radiation and other effects of the space environment, according to NASA documentation. Such systems can provide spacecraft power for more than a decade and can do so billions of miles from the sun. Twenty-seven U.S. missions have used RPS over the past 5 decades. The current RPS design, the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), converts heat given off by Pu-238 into about 120 watts of electrical power at the beginning of its life—a 6 percent power conversion efficiency. One MMRTG contains 32 general purpose heat source (GPHS) fuel clads in the form of pressed Pu-238 pellets encapsulated in iridium. NASA’s PSD science portfolio includes a wide array of missions that seek to address a variety of scientific objectives and answer many questions about the solar system, from how life began to how the solar system is evolving. Scientific and mission objectives influence the types of equipment needed for the mission, including the mission’s power source. According to NASA officials we interviewed, missions in NASA’s PSD portfolio are generally classified in three ways: Flagship. Flagship missions are the largest and most expensive class of NASA’s missions, costing $2 billion or more, and are given the highest priority for resources, including funding, infrastructure, and launch support. Past Flagship missions that have used RPS include the Galileo, Cassini, and Curiosity missions. NASA’s Mars 2020 mission is a planned Flagship mission using RPS. New Frontiers. New Frontiers missions focus on enhancing our understanding of the solar system and have a development cost cap of $850 million. To date, there has been one New Frontiers mission using RPS (New Horizons). Discovery. Missions in the Discovery program have a development cost cap of $450 million to $500 million and have shorter development time frames, according to NASA officials and documentation. No Discovery mission has been powered by RPS. DOE oversees the design, development, fabrication, testing, and delivery of RPS to meet NASA’s overall systems requirements, specifications, and schedules. DOE’s goal under its Supply Project is to reach a full Pu-238 production rate of 1.5 kg per year by 2023, at the earliest, with a late completion date of 2026. DOE also established an interim production rate of 300 to 500 grams per year by 2019, to ensure an adequate supply of Pu-238 for NASA’s near-term missions, before the full production rate goal is achieved. The Supply Project involves a number of steps across several DOE national laboratories, including the use of two DOE research reactors—the High Flux Isotope Reactor at ORNL, and the Advanced Test Reactor at INL. NASA began fully funding DOE’s Supply Project in 2011, and since 2014, has been responsible for funding all aspects of RPS production operations, according to NASA documents. NASA funds DOE’s efforts to build, test, and fuel RPS, as well as to update equipment and sustain staffing levels associated with RPS production between missions. Since 2014 NASA has provided, on average, approximately $50 million per year to support DOE’s ongoing operations and maintenance of RPS production equipment. Since its inception until early 2017, DOE has used a short-term and incremental segmented management approach to manage the Supply Project. NASA selects RPS to power its missions primarily based on scientific objectives and mission destinations. According to NASA officials we interviewed, the need for RPS is usually apparent based on the mission’s scientific objectives and destination. For instance, an RPS is more likely to be needed for a mission to a distant planet, where minimal sunlight reduces the effectiveness of solar power. NASA officials we interviewed stated that, consistent with the National Space Policy, the agency uses RPS when they enable or significantly enhance a mission, or when alternative power sources, such as solar power, might significantly compromise mission objectives. NASA prioritizes mission selection based on missions identified in the National Academy of Sciences’ decadal survey report, which represents the highest priorities of the scientific community and includes many missions that require the use of RPS. Prior to the establishment of DOE’s Supply Project in fiscal year 2011, NASA officials we interviewed stated that mission selections were influenced by the limited amount of available Pu-238. These same officials told us that missions are now selected independently from decisions about how they will be powered. However, projected availability of Pu-238 is factored into whether an RPS is available for a specific mission opportunity. In addition to the scientific objectives of planned and potential space exploration missions, several other factors may affect NASA’s demand for RPS and Pu-238: Costs associated with missions that typically require RPS. According to NASA officials, RPS have typically been used on Flagship missions that cost $2 billion or more. NASA can support no more than one mission using RPS about every 4 years—or two to three missions per decade—based on expected agency funding levels. Cost of RPS relative to mission costs. According to NASA officials, New Frontiers missions may be good candidates to use RPS; however, given the cost cap for this mission class, one RPS would account for about 9 percent of the mission’s budget, while three RPS would account for almost 14 percent. For Discovery missions, for which the cost of using RPS would represent a large portion of a Discovery mission budget, a single RPS would represent more than 17 percent of a mission’s development cap. DOE’s production capability. According to DOE officials we interviewed, it can take up to 6 years to acquire, fuel, test, and deliver a new RPS for a NASA mission. According to DOE and NASA officials we interviewed, given the current floor space dedicated to RPS development at INL and limits on staff exposure to radiation at LANL, DOE only has the capacity to produce three to four RPS at one time. To accommodate DOE’s current RPS production capability, NASA officials we interviewed said they will not select two consecutive missions requiring RPS. Technological advances may reduce the demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. For example, according to NASA officials, advances in solar power technology have realistically expanded the ability to use solar power for missions for which it would not have been considered before, and these advances could help address low levels of light intensity for deep space missions. NASA also is developing new RPS technologies that may reduce its demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. For example, NASA officials told us that they plan to invest in dynamic RPS technology that could increase RPS efficiency and require less RPS to achieve mission power. NASA research indicates that dynamic RPS designs could be more than four times as efficient as the current MMRTG design. The Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kg of Pu-238 per year was established to support two to three PSD missions using RPS each decade, and NASA does not anticipate other potential users to affect demand for RPS or Pu-238, according to NASA and DOE officials and documentation we reviewed. DOE planning documents and NASA officials we interviewed stated that current RPS and Pu-238 production levels expected from the Supply Project are intended to only meet PSD’s demand. NASA officials said that they did not account for potential demand from other potential users within NASA, the national security community, or commercial sectors when establishing current Pu-238 production goals. DOE has made progress meeting NASA’s future demand for Pu-238 to fuel RPS. A chronology of key DOE planned RPS and Pu-238 production activities, and NASA’s mission-related activities, are shown in figure 1. DOE demonstrated a proof of concept for new Pu-238 production, and has made approximately 100 grams of new Pu-238 isotope under its Supply Project, since the project’s inception in 2011. However, given DOE’s Supply Project and RPS production schedule, and NASA’s current space exploration plans to use up to four RPS for its Mars 2020 and New Frontiers #4 missions, DOE’s existing Pu-238 supply will be exhausted by 2025. Moreover, DOE officials we interviewed from INL, LANL, and ORNL identified several challenges, including perfecting and scaling up chemical processing and the availability of reactors, that need to be overcome for DOE to meet its projected Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kg per year of Pu-238 by 2026, at the latest. If these challenges are not overcome, DOE could experience delays in producing Pu-238 to fuel RPS for future NASA missions. DOE’s ability to meet its production goal and support future NASA missions is at risk if certain steps for chemical processing necessary for the production of Pu-238 are not improved and scaled up. According to DOE officials we interviewed, DOE is still in the experimental stage and has not perfected certain chemical processing measures required to extract new Pu-238 isotope from irradiated targets, creating a bottleneck in the Supply Project and putting production goals at risk. In addition, reactor availability will be necessary for DOE to achieve its Pu-238 production goals. Officials we interviewed at INL and ORNL said that achieving 1.5 kg of Pu-238 per year is contingent on the availability of positions within both the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) to irradiate neptunium targets for conversion to Pu-238 isotope. DOE officials said HFIR can produce approximately 600 grams of Pu-238 isotope and they plan to use positions within ATR to achieve full production goals; however, ATR has not been qualified for Supply Project work. In addition, DOE officials said that ATR’s availability for the Supply Project may be limited due to competition from other users. DOE officials said that they will be unable to meet full Pu-238 production goals if positions in ATR, which are already over-utilized, are not available for Pu-238 isotope production and that they do not have a plan to address this challenge. These and other challenges identified in our September 2017 report may place DOE’s RPS and Pu-238 production goals at risk, in part, because of the short-term and incremental segmented management approach DOE had used to manage the Supply Project since its inception in 2011 through early 2017. In March 2017, DOE officials we interviewed said that the agency anticipated moving to a constant GPHS production rate approach to help provide funding flexibility and stabilize RPS production staffing levels between NASA missions. In June 2017, DOE officials we interviewed said that implementing a constant GPHS production rate approach would also address other previously identified challenges associated with RPS production and the Supply Project and therefore decided to discontinue its short-term and incremental segmented management approach. However, DOE officials we interviewed did not describe how the new constant GPHS production rate approach would help them address some of the longer-term challenges previously identified by the agency, such as scaling up and perfecting chemical processing. We found that DOE has yet to develop an implementation plan for the new approach, with defined tasks and milestones, that can be used to show progress toward assessing challenges, demonstrate how risks are being addressed, or assist in making adjustments to its efforts when necessary. Our previous work has shown that without defined tasks and milestones, it is difficult for agencies to set priorities, use resources efficiently, and monitor progress toward achieving program objectives. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that DOE develop a plan that outlined interim steps and milestones that would allow the agency to monitor and assess the implementation of its new approach for managing Pu-238 and RPS production. DOE agreed with our recommendation and noted it was in the process of implementing an approach for the RPS supply chain that was more responsive to NASA’s needs, among other things. DOE also noted that it was developing an integrated program plan to implement and document the agency’s new approach and expected this to be completed in September 2018. We believe that the development of an integrated program plan is an important step and that any such plan should include defined tasks and milestones, so that DOE can demonstrate progress toward achieving its RPS supply chain goals. In addition, in our September 2017 report we identified another factor that could undermine DOE’s ability to inform NASA about previously identified challenges to reach its full Pu-238 production goal. We found that DOE does not maintain a comprehensive system for tracking RPS production risks and, instead, relies on individual laboratories to track and manage risks specific to their laboratories. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for agency management to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. We recommended that DOE develop a more comprehensive system to track systemic risks, beyond the specific technical risks identified by individual laboratories. Doing so would better position DOE to assess the long-term effects of the challenges associated with its Pu-238 and RPS production objectives. DOE agreed with our recommendation and stated that the agency would include steps to ensure that its risk assessment system would include comprehensive programmatic risks. Finally, in our September 2017 report we found that DOE’s new approach to managing RPS and Pu-238 production does not allow for DOE to adequately communicate long-term challenges to NASA. It is also unclear how DOE will use its new management approach to communicate to NASA challenges related to Pu-238 production. As a result, NASA may not have adequate information to plan for future missions using RPS. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for agency management to use quality information to achieve agency objectives and communicate quality information externally through reporting lines so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives and address related risks. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that DOE assess the long-term effects that known challenges may have on Pu-238 production quantities, time frames, and required funding, and communicate these potential effects to NASA. DOE stated that it agreed with our recommendation and would work with NASA to identify, assess, and develop plans to address known challenges. DOE also stated that the agency expected to complete this effort in September 2019. Chairman Babin, Ranking Member Bera, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selects radioisotope power systems (RPS) for missions primarily based on the agency's scientific objectives and mission destinations. Prior to the establishment of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Supply Project in fiscal year 2011 to produce new plutonium-238 (Pu-238), NASA officials said that Pu-238 supply was a limiting factor in selecting RPS-powered missions. After the initiation of the Supply Project, however, NASA officials GAO interviewed said that missions are selected independently of decisions on how to power them. Once a mission is selected, NASA considers power sources early in its mission review process. Multiple factors could affect NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238. For example, high costs associated with RPS and missions can affect the demand for RPS because, according to officials, NASA's budget can only support one RPS mission about every 4 years. Expected technological advances in RPS efficiency could reduce NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238. DOE has made progress in reestablishing Pu-238 production to meet NASA's future demand to fuel RPS and has identified challenges to meeting its production goals. Specifically, since the start of the Supply Project, DOE has produced 100 grams of Pu-238 and expects to finalize production processes and produce interim quantities by 2019. However, DOE has also identified several challenges to meeting the Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kilograms (kg) of new Pu-238 per year by 2026. DOE officials GAO interviewed said that DOE has not perfected the chemical processing required to extract new Pu-238 from irradiated targets to meet production goals. These officials also said that achieving the Pu-238 production goal is contingent on the use of two reactors, but only one reactor is currently qualified for Pu-238 production while the second reactor awaits scheduled maintenance. Moreover, while DOE has adopted a new approach for managing the Supply Project and RPS production—based on a constant production approach—the agency has not developed an implementation plan that identifies milestones and interim steps that can be used to demonstrate progress in meeting production goals and addressing previously identified challenges. GAO's prior work shows that plans that include milestones and interim steps help an agency to set priorities, use resources efficiently, and monitor progress in achieving agency goals. By developing a plan with milestones and interim steps for DOE's approach to managing Pu-238 and RPS production, DOE can show progress in implementing its approach and make adjustments when necessary. Lastly, DOE's new approach to managing the Supply Project does not improve its ability to assess the potential long-term effects of challenges DOE identified, such as chemical processing and reactor availability, or to communicate these effects to NASA. For example, DOE officials did not explain how the new approach would help assess the long-term effects of challenges, such as those related to chemical processing. Under Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , agencies should use quality information to achieve objectives and to communicate externally, so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. Without the ability to assess the long-term effects of known challenges and communicate those effects to NASA, DOE may be jeopardizing NASA's ability to use RPS as a power source for future missions."], "length": 3082, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a82fc190d53deee032a07443b05f0df6d0818cf9fb8cb3ac"}
{"input": "", "context": "There are several aspects of individual market plans sold through the exchanges for consumers to consider when selecting a plan, including: (1) metal tiers; (2) premium variation and plan availability; (3) covered benefits; and (4) premium tax credits. Current exchange consumers who are eligible for continued health insurance and do not actively select and enroll in a health plan for the subsequent year may be automatically re-enrolled in the same or a similar crosswalked plan. Plans sold through exchanges are offered at one of four levels of coverage, or metal tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—that reflect the out-of-pocket costs that may be incurred by a consumer. The four metal tiers correspond to the plan’s actuarial value—a measure of the relative generosity of a plan’s benefits that is expressed as a percentage of the covered medical expenses expected to be paid, on average, by the issuer for a standard population and set of allowed charges for in-network providers. The actuarial values of these metal tiers are as follows: bronze (60 percent), silver (70 percent), gold (80 percent), and platinum (90 percent). If an issuer sells a plan on an exchange, it must offer at least one plan at the silver level and one plan at the gold level. Issuers are not required to offer bronze or platinum plans. Premium Variation and Plan Availability As we have previously reported, the range of premiums for health plans offered through the exchanges can vary widely across counties and states, and the number and type of plans available in the health insurance exchanges vary from year to year. Issuers can add new plans and adjust or discontinue existing plans from year to year, or they can extend or restrict the locations in which plans are offered. As a result, the options available to consumers can change from year to year. PPACA requires that health insurance plans offered through the exchanges be certified as qualified health plans, meaning that they must provide essential health benefits, comply with cost sharing limits, and meet certain other requirements. Essential health benefits include items and services within ten categories. Some health insurance plans offered through the exchanges include benefits above and beyond the minimum requirements. For these plans, only the percentage of the plan premium that covers the essential health benefits is considered when determining the consumer’s benchmark plan. Certain consumers purchasing health insurance through the exchanges are eligible for and receive premium tax credits that may reduce their out-of-pocket costs for premiums. To be eligible for premium tax credits, individuals and families must generally have a household income of at least 100, but no more than 400, percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). Consumers who are eligible for premium tax credits and enrolled in the benchmark plan are responsible for paying premiums that are generally limited to a percentage of household income, such that individuals and families with lower household incomes contribute a smaller portion of their income toward the health plan premium than individuals and families with higher incomes, and premium tax credits may be applied to only the portion of the premium that covers essential health benefits. For example, in 2016, the percentage of household income that consumers who were eligible for premium tax credits and who lived in the United States were expected to pay toward the portion of their premiums for their benchmark plan that covered essential health benefits was 2.03 percent for those at 100 percent of the FPL, 8.18 percent for those at 250 percent of FPL, and 9.66 percent for those at 400 percent of FPL. A consumer’s required contribution to the premium is the amount of that benchmark plan premium that is not covered by the premium tax credit. (See table 1.) Although consumers’ premium tax credit amounts are determined in part based on the cost of premiums for their local benchmark plan, the credit can also be applied towards the premiums for other eligible exchange plans. However, the premium tax credit available to consumers does not increase if they enroll in exchange plans with higher premiums than the local benchmark plan. In such cases, consumers are responsible not only for their required contribution but also for the difference in premiums. Similarly, if a consumer chooses to enroll in an exchange plan with lower premiums than the local benchmark plan premium, then the consumer’s premium tax credit would also generally remain the same, so the consumer would pay less for that plan. The tax credit cannot, however, exceed the total value of the premium. Because most consumers enrolling in exchange plans are eligible for premium tax credits, most consumers’ out-of-pocket premium costs are lower than the advertised cost of premiums. (See table 2.) Re-enrollment in an exchange plan may occur through either an active choice by a consumer or through automatic re-enrollment by the exchange. Eligible returning consumers may enroll in a health insurance plan through the exchange each year during an open enrollment period. Federally facilitated exchanges automatically re-enroll eligible exchange consumers for the next year, unless their health insurance is terminated or the consumer makes an active plan selection. Through automatic re-enrollment a consumer is re-enrolled in the same plan for the next year if that plan remains available to him or her; if the same plan is no longer available (e.g., because the issuer decided to discontinue a particular plan or to stop offering the plan in certain locations), then the consumer is generally re-enrolled in a similar crosswalked plan. The criteria HHS established for identifying appropriate similar crosswalked plans have changed over time, but the similar crosswalked plan is typically the same metal tier level as the original plan. During the 2015 to 2016 transition, all similar crosswalked plans were plans offered by the same issuer as the original plan. If that issuer no longer offered an exchange plan, there was generally no crosswalked plan and automatic re-enrollment was not an option. Starting with the 2016 to 2017 transition, if the original issuer did not offer a similar plan, then automatic re-enrollment could be into a health plan offered by a different issuer, with plan similarity determined using established criteria. Both issuers and exchanges have had roles in informing consumers about the enrollment process. For example, prior to the start of the 2015 and 2016 open enrollment periods, both the exchange and health plan issuer were to provide current exchange consumers with general information about the upcoming enrollment period, including key dates and information regarding eligibility for re-enrollment. In addition, some consumers were also to receive special notices from the exchange that provided more detailed information regarding their application status, eligibility for enrollment and affordability programs, and potential effects on enrollment if they had not updated information about their income or eligibility or reviewed their re-enrollment options with the exchange prior to the end of the open enrollment period. Consumers who were automatically re-enrolled by an exchange were to receive an additional notice with updated information about their re-enrollment status. According to CMS officials, automatically re-enrolled consumers were provided with information about their new premium amount and any new advance premium tax credit amounts in a message confirming their enrollment. In most of the nearly 2,600 counties included in our analysis, the plan that we identified as the benchmark plan changed from 2015 to 2017. For example, in 85 percent of the counties included in our analysis, the 2015 benchmark plans were not benchmark plans in either 2016 or 2017, the other 2 years we studied. The benchmark plan was the same plan in all 3 years in only 3 percent of counties. (See table 3.) In addition, benchmark plan premiums were more likely to increase than decrease from year to year, and increases were higher from 2016 to 2017 than they were from 2015 to 2016. Among all the counties in our analysis, the median change in monthly premiums for the benchmark plans was an increase of 11 percent from 2015 to 2016, and 28 percent 2016 to 2017. As shown in figure 1, the gross premiums for benchmark plans increased by more than 55 percent from 2016 to 2017 in 12.4 percent of the counties in our analysis but did not increase by more than 55 percent in any counties from 2015 to 2016. In contrast, although not particularly common, relatively stable or even decreasing premiums from year to year were more likely from 2015 to 2016 than from 2016 to 2017. Appendix I provides examples of median benchmark plan premiums for 2015, 2016, and 2017 for select groups of consumers. Because premium tax credits limit eligible consumers’ payments for benchmark plan premiums to a percentage of their income, an increase in premiums may not increase their financial responsibility. Instead, for eligible consumers, the amount of the tax credit would increase. According to HHS, most exchange consumers have been eligible for these tax credits; those who were not eligible for tax credits would not have this protection from premium increases. The premium increases for consumers who were not eligible for premium tax credits, or for those who were eligible but who chose plans that had higher premiums than their benchmark plan premiums, could have had a more substantial financial impact, because premium tax credits would not have offset, or fully offset, the higher premiums. Although gross premiums for benchmark plans were likely to increase from 2015 to 2016 and from 2016 to 2017, we found that in many counties, the implications for automatically re-enrolled consumers were modest because net premiums—after accounting for tax credits for those eligible for those credits—were limited. We compared the 2016 premiums for plans that had been benchmark plans in 2015 to the 2016 benchmark plan premiums, and we compared the 2017 premiums for plans that had been benchmark plans in 2016 to the 2017 benchmark plan premiums. To focus this analysis on the potential effects for those who were automatically re-enrolled, we limited our comparisons to plans that were available in both years, or plans for which a similar crosswalked plan had been identified for the second year. For this analysis, we excluded plans that were benchmark plans in one year and were also benchmark plans, or were crosswalked to a benchmark plan, in the following year. We found that in many counties, the new premiums for plans that had been (but were no longer) benchmark plans differed only modestly from the new benchmark plan premiums. For example, in 60 percent or more of the counties in our analysis, the premium for the previous benchmark plan was within plus or minus about 7.5 percent of the new benchmark plan premium. This finding indicates that automatic re-enrollment from a benchmark plan into a plan that was not a benchmark plan did not necessarily result in substantially higher premiums compared to the premiums for the new benchmark plans, and the same would be true for consumers who actively chose their same or similar crosswalked plan. While modest premium differences were not uncommon in either year, figure 2 also shows that some differences were substantial. (See fig. 2.) Although consumers who were eligible for premium tax credits were somewhat insulated from large differences in premiums, if they were automatically re-enrolled in a plan with a premium that was higher than their benchmark plan premium, no matter how great the difference, they would have been be required to pay a larger share of their incomes on those premiums. And, as already noted, the premium differences for consumers who were not eligible for premium tax credits, or for those who were eligible but who chose plans that had higher premiums than their benchmark plan, could have had a more substantial financial impact because premium tax credits would not have offset, or fully offset, the higher premiums. Among consumers who were enrolled in plans through the federal platform in both 2015 and 2016, 30 percent (about 1.7 million consumers) were automatically re-enrolled. Of those consumers who were automatically re-enrolled, 71 percent were re-enrolled in their same plan and 29 percent were re-enrolled in a similar crosswalked plan, because their 2015 plan had been discontinued or was no longer offered in the consumer’s local area. These data do not indicate whether these consumers explored their options for switching plans and made an active decision not to change plans. The remaining 70 percent of consumers who enrolled in exchange plans through the federal platform in both 2015 and 2016 (more than 3.9 million consumers) actively re-enrolled in 2016. Of these consumers, 39 percent chose the same plan in which they had been enrolled in 2015 or the similar crosswalked plan to which they would have been automatically re-enrolled. The majority of consumers who re-enrolled actively, 61 percent, switched to a plan that was neither their 2015 plan nor the similar crosswalked plan. (See fig. 3.) Of those consumers who actively switched plans, more than half (54 percent) would have been automatically re-enrolled in their same plan if they had not actively switched plans, indicating that plan discontinuation was not the only factor involved in consumers’ decisions to change plans. Consumers’ median net monthly premiums (after premium tax credits) generally increased less from 2015 to 2016 for those who actively re-enrolled ($5) than for those who were automatically re-enrolled ($22). As shown in table 4, consumers who actively re-enrolled had a lower median increase in their net monthly premiums than consumers who were automatically re-enrolled for both the same and similar crosswalked plans. Moreover, table 4 also shows that consumers who re-enrolled actively, and who switched plans from 2015 to 2016, enrolled in plans with median monthly net premiums that increased the least overall—a median net increase of $1 compared to $13 per month for those who enrolled in the same plan. In addition, the table shows that enrollment in a similar crosswalked plan did not generally result in a higher median net premium than enrollment in the same plan: whether enrollment was active or automatic, consumers’ median net monthly premiums increased less for those who enrolled in a similar crosswalked plan than for those who enrolled in the same plan. Changes in net monthly premiums varied around these medians, however, with some consumers facing large increases or, in some cases, large decreases in their net monthly premiums. Large increases or decreases in net monthly premiums could result from changes to eligibility for tax credits, selections of plans of different metal levels, or other circumstances. Our findings are consistent with other work by ASPE that suggested that consumers consider possible cost savings when deciding to switch plans. For example, ASPE found that average net monthly premium for the 61 percent of consumers who actively switched plans in 2016 was $132, which represented an average savings of $42 per month compared to what they would have paid if they stayed in their same or similar crosswalked plans. This work also found that the net monthly premiums of consumers who actively chose to remain in their same or similar crosswalked plans in 2016 were, on average, only $10 more than those for consumers who actively switched plans. In addition, ASPE found that consumers’ plan selections indicated sensitivity to net premiums. For example, ASPE found that consumers were much more likely to switch plans when the net premium of their 2015 plan increased than when the gross premium of their 2015 plan increased, but the net premium did not.

Those who do not actively enroll in a plan may be automatically reenrolled into a plan. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, automatic re-enrollment is intended to help ensure consumers' continuity in coverage. However, some have questioned whether automatic reenrollment could have unintended financial consequences for consumers. GAO was asked to review automatic reenrollment and benchmark plans. GAO examined 1) the extent to which plans identified as benchmark plans remained the same plans from year to year, and how premiums for benchmark plans changed; 2) the proportion of exchange consumers who were automatically re-enrolled into the same or similar plans, and how these proportions compared to those for consumers who actively re-enrolled, and 3) the extent to which consumers' financial responsibility for premiums changed for those who were automatically re-enrolled compared to those who actively re-enrolled. GAO reviewed relevant guidance and analyzed county-based data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the 37 states that used the federal information platform, healthcare.gov, from 2015 through 2017. GAO also interviewed CMS and ASPE officials and analyzed information from ASPE on reenrollment from 2015 to 2016. Through the exchanges established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, consumers can directly compare and select among health plans based on a variety of factors, including premiums. Most consumers who purchase health plans through the exchanges receive tax credits to help them pay for their premiums. The value of a consumer's premium tax credit is based, in part, on the premium for the benchmark plan, which is the second lowest cost option available in the consumer's local area within the exchange's silver metal tier (one of four metal tiers that indicate the value of plans). Because plan premiums and plan availability can change over time, the benchmark plan in each local market can also change over time. GAO analyzed changes in benchmark plans and premiums from 2015 through 2017 and found: In most of the nearly 2,600 counties included in the analysis, the plans identified as benchmark plans, and the premiums for these plans, changed from year to year. For example, in 85 percent of counties, the 2015 benchmark plans were not benchmark plans in either 2016 or 2017. Gross benchmark premiums (exclusive of tax credits) increased from year to year, and increases were higher from 2016 to 2017 than they were from 2015 to 2016. Premium tax credits would limit the costs of increasing premiums for most consumers, though some consumers, including those not eligible for premium tax credits, would have incurred more or all of the higher premium costs. During the annual open enrollment period, consumers who do not make an active plan selection are automatically reenrolled into their existing plan or, if that plan is no longer available, they are generally re-enrolled into a similar plan if one has been identified. GAO analyzed information from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) for consumers enrolled in both 2015 and 2016 and found: About 30 percent of consumers were automatically re-enrolled in 2016, while the remaining 70 percent chose to actively re-enroll. Median net monthly premiums—what consumers paid after premium tax credits—increased less from 2015 to 2016 for those who actively enrolled ($5) than for those who were automatically reenrolled ($22), although there was variation. Our findings are consistent with other work by ASPE that suggests that consumers consider possible cost savings when deciding to switch plans.

{"input": "", "context": "Since 1993, USAID has obligated more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, primarily using funds appropriated through the ESF. According to State officials, through the ESF, USAID provides project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors. USAID, with overall foreign policy guidance from State, implements most ESF programs, including programs related to private sector development, health, water and road infrastructure, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. According to USAID officials, this assistance to the West Bank and Gaza contributes to building a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society—a goal that USAID described as being in the interest of the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel. Figure 1 shows the location of the West Bank and Gaza relative to surrounding countries. USAID assistance to the West Bank and Gaza is conducted under antiterrorism policies and procedures outlined in an administrative policy document known as Mission Order 21. The stated purpose of the mission order, as amended, is to describe policies and procedures to ensure that the mission’s program assistance does not inadvertently provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism. We have previously reported on the status of ESF assistance to the Palestinians and USAID’s antiterrorism policies and procedures in the West Bank and Gaza. As of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $544.1 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $350.6 million (over 64 percent) of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (see table 1). USAID obligated portions of the allocated funds for direct payments to PA creditors—specifically, payments to two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and to a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. Project assistance obligated for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 accounted for about $215 million (74 percent) and $184 million (72 percent), respectively, of USAID’s obligations of ESF assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for those fiscal years (see fig. 1). Payments to the PA’s creditors accounted for the remaining obligations—about $75 million (26 percent) of fiscal year 2015 obligations and about $70 million (28 percent) of fiscal year 2016 obligations. According to USAID documents, ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 was obligated for three USAID development objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure (about $239 million), Investing in the Next Generation (about $107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). Program support—which sustains all development objectives, according to USAID—accounted for about $29 million (see table 2). Economic Growth and Infrastructure. The largest share—about 60 percent—of USAID’s ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported the agency’s Economic Growth and Infrastructure development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, the agency had obligated about $239 million and expended approximately $89 million (about 37 percent) for projects under this objective. USAID officials stated that the agency funded these projects under the following standard State-budgeted program areas: health (including water), infrastructure, private sector competiveness, and stabilization operations and security sector reform. The largest project—the Architecture and Engineering Services project—received about $20 million of fiscal year 2015 ESF assistance and $17 million of fiscal year 2016 ESF assistance. The purpose of the project was to rehabilitate and construct infrastructure through the procurement of infrastructure services, including engineering design and construction management, among other things. The contractor was required to coordinate with relevant PA and Israeli entities, as well as with USAID, to assist in the selection of PA water and wastewater projects and in the planning and design of water projects such as small- to large-scale water distribution systems, water treatment systems, and institutional capacity building. Investing in the Next Generation. The second-largest share—about 27 percent—of USAID’s fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza supported the agency’s Investing in the Next Generation development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, the agency had obligated about $107 million and expended approximately $79 million (about 74 percent) for projects under this objective. Program areas funded included education, health, social and economic services and protection of vulnerable populations. The largest project funded under this objective—a grant to the World Food Program for assistance to vulnerable groups—received $12 million in fiscal year 2015 and $15 million in fiscal year 2016 ESF assistance. The project focused on ensuring food security, including meeting food needs, of the nonrefugee population; increasing food availability and dietary diversity for the most vulnerable and food-insecure nonrefugee population; and establishing linkages with the Palestinian private sector (shopkeepers, farms, and factories) to produce and deliver the aid being provided to Palestinians. For example, the project directly distributed a standard food ration through both direct food distribution and electronic food vouchers to vulnerable nonrefugee families. Governance and Civic Engagement. The smallest share—about 6 percent—of USAID’s fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza supported the agency’s Governance and Civic Engagement development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $24.6 million and expended approximately $14.5 million (about 60 percent) for projects in program areas that included civil society, good governance, and rule of law. The largest project funded under this objective—a contract for the Communities Thrive Project— received about $5.2 million and $8 million in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance, respectively. The project aimed to help 55 West Bank municipalities improve fiscal management, fiscal accountability and transparency, and delivery and management of municipal services, among other things. Under debt relief grant agreements with the PA, USAID made direct payments of ESF assistance to PA creditors totaling about $75 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $70 million from fiscal year 2016 funds. USAID paid about $40 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $45 million from fiscal year 2016 funds to two oil companies to cover debts for petroleum purchases. In addition, USAID paid about $35 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $25 million from fiscal year 2016 funds to the Bank of Palestine, to pay off a PA line of credit that was used to cover PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. Before using fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance to pay PA creditors, USAID vetted the creditors to ensure that the assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism, as required by its policies and procedures. USAID determined that certain legal requirements, including the requirement for an assessment of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning, were not applicable for direct payments of these funds to PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID continued to commission external assessments and financial audits of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation for payments to creditors shows that before signing debt relief agreements with the PA, mission officials checked, as required by Mission Order 21, the vetting status of PA creditors who would receive direct payments under the agreements, to ensure their eligibility before any payment was made. USAID Mission Order 21 requires that before payments to PA creditors are executed, the creditors must be vetted—that is, the creditors’ key individuals and other identifying information must be checked against the federal Terrorist Screening Center database and other information sources to determine whether they have links to terrorism. According to USAID policies and procedures, each PA creditor must be vetted if more than 12 months have passed since the last time the creditor was vetted and approved to receive ESF payments. We found that for payments made to PA creditors using fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance, USAID vetted each PA creditor that received payments and completed the vetting during the 12- month period before the debt relief agreements with the PA were signed (see table 3). USAID determined that certain legal requirements applicable to cash transfers to the PA were not applicable to direct payments to PA creditors of fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance. In September 2015, we reported that USAID ceased making cash payments directly to the PA in 2014 and began making payments of ESF assistance directly to PA creditors. In reviewing USAID’s compliance with key legal requirements, we found that USAID had complied with the requirements when making cash transfers to the PA in fiscal year 2013. However, USAID had determined that some requirements were not applicable to direct payments made to PA creditors in fiscal year 2014, because no funds were being provided directly to the PA. After fiscal year 2015, USAID further defined the scope of statutory requirements it deemed applicable to payments to PA creditors using fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance, under the rationale that these payments do not constitute direct payments to the PA. Specifically, according to USAID, the agency determined that the following statutory requirements discussed in our prior report were not applicable to direct payments to PA creditors. A requirement to notify the Committees on Appropriations 15 days before obligating funds for a cash transfer to the PA A requirement for the PA to maintain cash transfer funds in a separate account A requirement for the President to waive the prohibition on providing funds to the PA and to submit an accompanying report to the Committees on Appropriations A requirement for the Secretary of State to provide a certification and accompanying report to the Committees on Appropriations when the President waives the prohibition on providing funds to the PA Requirements for direct government-to-government assistance, including an assessment of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning According to USAID officials, they currently do not plan to resume cash payments to the PA, because making direct payments to creditors minimizes the misuse of funds and assures full transparency and appropriateness of transfers. Although USAID concluded that the statutory requirement mandating assessments of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning did not apply to direct payments to PA creditors, the West Bank and Gaza mission commissioned external assessments of the PA Ministry of Health’s medical referral services and Ministry of Finance and Planning’s petroleum procurement system. According to a USAID document, while the payments to the creditors did not constitute direct budget support to the PA, the agency chose to commission external assessments to determine whether the PA’s financial systems were sufficient to ensure adequate accountability for USAID funds consistent with legislative requirements for direct budget support funds. These external assessments identified weaknesses in both systems. Ministry of Health medical referrals. The assessment report stated that the ministry did not have approved policies and procedures for the medical referral process, a list of medical services covered by the referral system, and written criteria for selecting referral hospitals in the medical referral systems. In response, in a January 2016 internal memorandum, the West Bank and Gaza mission officials concluded, among other things, that the findings did not pose a significant risk to USAID funds. They also stated that the Ministry of Health’s medical referral system had adequate policies and procedures for referrals to local hospitals. However, after the assessment report was issued, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. Ministry of Finance and Planning petroleum procurements. The assessment report stated that the ministry lacked specific policies and procedures to prevent or detect fraud in the petroleum procurement systems. In the West Bank and Gaza mission’s January 2016 memorandum, USAID mission officials disagreed with the assessment’s findings regarding the petroleum procurement system, stating that the assessment did not take into account sufficient and adequate internal controls at the ministry as a first line of defense against fraud. The memorandum also stated that the finding did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. USAID officials told us that, while they did not believe the external assessments’ findings affected the integrity of USAID’s debt relief payment process, they took four additional steps to mitigate findings noted in the assessment of the Ministry of Finance and Planning’s fuel procurement processes. According to USAID officials, they (1) confirmed that the fuel companies had controls and systems to ensure an objective and transparent system in receiving and recording PA orders, (2) dispatched orders with official and properly signed shipping delivery and receipt documents, (3) obtained written confirmation from the fuel companies of the costs of the fuel provided to the PA, and (4) confirmed the PA’s petroleum debt with the fuel companies before initiating the payments and after making the payments. In addition, in 2016, USAID commissioned two routine financial audits of the debt relief grant agreed to by USAID and the PA for the use of fiscal year 2015 ESF assistance to make direct payments to PA creditors. According to USAID officials, the auditors were to examine the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning’s recording of USAID payments to PA creditors in its financial records as well as the ministry’s and USAID’s compliance with the terms of the grant agreement and related implementation letters. The audits did not identify any questioned or ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the debt relief grant. Also, in 2017, USAID contracted for a financial audit of the fiscal year 2016 debt relief grant agreed to by USAID and the PA. According to a USAID document, in May 2018, USAID held an entrance conference with the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning for the audit of the fiscal year 2016 grant. In July 2018, USAID sent the final audit report to the Regional Inspector General for review. According to the USAID document, the report did not identify any questioned or ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal controls, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the grant. We provided a draft of this report to USAID and State for review and comment. USAID provided comments, which we have reproduced in appendix II, as well as technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. State did not provide comments.

Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries’ capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. To address our first objective, we reviewed appropriations legislation, related budget justification documents, and financial data for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including expenditures as of March 31, 2018, provided by USAID’s West Bank and Gaza mission in Tel Aviv, Israel. We reviewed data that USAID provided on obligations and expenditures of all ESF assistance for the West Bank and Gaza as of March 31, 2018, from annual allocations for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. We also reviewed relevant USAID documents, including notifications to Congress regarding the use of appropriated funds. In addition, we interviewed USAID and State officials in Washington, D.C., and Tel Aviv. To determine whether the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report, we requested and reviewed information from USAID officials about their procedures for entering contract and financial information into USAID’s data system. We determined that the USAID data were sufficiently reliable. For the project information included in this report, we relied on data that USAID provided, showing its obligations and expenditures of fiscal year 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance for West Bank and Gaza. For illustrative purposes, we requested and obtained from USAID descriptions of projects that, according to USAID officials, represented the largest financial obligations for each development objective in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. To address our second objective, we identified and reviewed relevant legal requirements as well as USAID policies and procedures to comply with those requirements. USAID Mission Order 21 is the primary document that details USAID procedures to ensure that the mission’s assistance program does not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism, consistent with the prohibition on such support found in relevant laws and executive orders. In addition, we reviewed 27 USAID determinations of compliance for payments to PA creditors and discussed with USAID mission officials their efforts to comply with the policies and procedures in Mission Order 21 before executing payments to hospitals, companies, and banks that facilitated the payments. We also reviewed the timing of USAID’s vetting of each PA creditor that received payments, to ensure that, as required by Mission Order 21, the vetting occurred within 12 months before USAID signed the relevant debt relief grant agreement with the PA. Further, we reviewed external assessments of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning and financial audits of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning, and we discussed the assessments’ and audits with USAID officials responsible for payments to PA creditors. We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to August 2018, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza.

GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

{"input": "", "context": "Congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding. Broadly, the term authorization is used to describe legislation that establishes, continues, or modifies the organization or activities of a federal entity or program. By itself, such legislation does not provide funding for such purposes. Instead, the authority to obligate payments from the Treasury is left to separate appropriations measures. This distinction between appropriations and general legislation as two separate classes of measures, and their consideration in separate legislative vehicles, is a construct of congressional rules and practices. It has been developed and formalized by the House and Senate pursuant to the constitutional authority for each chamber to \"determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\" This power permits each chamber of Congress to enforce, modify, waive, repeal, or ignore its rules as it sees fit. Because the two chambers exercise this rulemaking authority independently, they have developed differing (albeit generally similar) rules and practices. This report addresses solely developments in the House. According to Hinds' Precedents , the origin of a formal rule mandating the separation of general legislation from appropriations can be traced to 1835, when the House debated the increasing problem of delay in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of \"debatable matters of another character, new laws which created long debates in both Houses\" and suggested that the Committee on Ways and Means should \"strip the appropriation bills of every thing but were legitimate matters of appropriation.\" In the following Congress (25 th Congress, 1837-1839), language was added to House rules that stated: No appropriation shall be reported in such general appropriation bills, or be in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law. This rule was applied broadly on occasion to exclude legislative provisions authorizing new expenditures as well, such as a case in 1838 when it was used to exclude an amendment that included a provision for refurnishing the White House. Gradually, the rule \"became construed through a long line of decisions to admit amendments increasing salaries but as excluding amendments providing for decreases.\" As a consequence of this, in 1876, the language was expanded (at the suggestion of Representative William Holman of Indiana) to further state: Nor shall any provision in any such bill or amendment thereto, changing existing law, be in order except such as, being germane to the subject matter of the bill, shall retrench expenditures. As described by one scholar, this provision effectively granted the Appropriations Committee authority to include virtually any legislative provision in an appropriations measure so long as it reduced the number and salary of federal officials, the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury, or the amounts of money covered in an appropriation bill. According to one contemporary account, a broad initial construction of the rule by the House resulted in \"putting a great mass of general legislation upon the appropriation bills.\" The rule was retained in this form until 1880 (46 th Congress), when it was modified to define retrenchments as the reduction of \"the number and salary of officers of the United States, the reduction of compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States, or the reduction of the amounts of money covered by the bill.\" That form of the rule remained a part of House rules until the 49 th Congress eliminated it in 1885. It was reinserted in the rules for the 52 nd and 53 rd Congresses (1891-1895) but was again dropped for the 54 th through 61 st Congresses (1895-1911) before being readopted in the 62 nd Congress. Although the Holman rule has remained a part of House rules since that time, its language was amended at the start of the 98 th Congress (1983-1984). At that time, it was restructured to narrow the exception to the general prohibition against legislation to allow only retrenchments reducing amounts of money covered by the bill. In addition, the House rules for the 98 th Congress changed when retrenchment amendments could be offered. Amendments that only alter the items or amounts in an appropriation bill are generally in order when the measure is read for amendment and must be offered as the relevant paragraph or section of the bill is read. The new version of the rule provided, however, that germane amendments to retrench expenditures (as well as limitation amendments) would be in order only after the reading of a general appropriation bill and if a preferential motion that the Committee of the Whole rise and report (essentially ending consideration of the bill) were rejected. Further stylistic changes were made when the House recodified its rules in the 106 th Congress (1999-2000) to make explicit that retrenchment amendments are in order if the motion to rise and report is not offered—as well as if the motion is rejected. It also clarified that the effect of a point of order against legislation in an appropriations bill (and, by extension, the application of the Holman rule exception) is surgical so that it lies against an offending provision in the text and not against consideration of the entire bill. The Holman rule currently states the following: A provision changing existing law may not be reported in a general appropriation bill, including a provision making the availability of funds contingent on the receipt or possession of information not required by existing law for the period of the appropriation, except germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill [emphasis added]. The Holman rule, thus, does not circumscribe Congress's lawmaking authority but rather provides a limited exception to the general prohibition in House rules against legislation in appropriation measures. For the 115 th Congress, the House included a separate order as Section 3(a) of H.Res. 5 , adopting the rules of the House, that provides the following: During the first session of the One Hundred Fifteenth Congress, any reference in clause 2 of rule XXI to a provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill shall be construed as applying to any provision or amendment (offered after the bill has been read for amendment) that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. As stated in a section-by section summary included in the Congressional Record by Representative Pete Sessions, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, the purpose of this provision is \"to see if the reinstatement of the Holman rule will provide Members with additional tools to reduce spending during consideration of the regular general appropriation bill.\" The applicability of this separate order was extended under Section 5 of H.Res. 787 (115 th Congress) which provided that \"Section 3(a) of House Resolution 5 is amended by striking 'the first session of.'\" This separate order was not adopted for the 116 th Congress, so the application of the rule reverts to being guided by prior precedents rather than this language. Since the period immediately after the initial adoption of the rule in the 19 th century, the House has interpreted it through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. For example, early precedents established that while it was not always necessary that a retrenchment specify the amount of a reduction of expenditures, it must appear as a necessary result of the legislation to be in order and that it is not sufficient that such reduction would probably (or would in the opinion of the chair) result therefrom. For example, legislation that would simply confer discretionary authority to terminate employment of federal employees is not in order under the Holman exception because any resulting savings would be speculative. The reduction also may not be contingent on an event. Furthermore, the rule is not applicable to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill. The Holman rule then is intended to apply only when an obvious reduction of funds in a general appropriations bill is achieved by the provision in question, such as the cessation of specific government activities, or through a specific reduction of total appropriations in the bill. In addition, the exception does not apply to limitations (on the grounds that such language is not legislative) or legislative language unaccompanied by a reduction of funds in the bill. Legislation that is too broad has also typically not been allowed under the Holman rule exception. The House has held, for example, that a provision that stated no part of an appropriation could be expended for a specific, designated purpose qualified as a retrenchment. However, a proposal that effectively repealed the law under which appropriations for that purpose were authorized was held not to come within the exception. In another case, the House held that even when a provision does reduce expenditures, it may not be accompanied by additional legislative provisions not directly contributing to the reduction. The separate order for the 115 th Congress effectively reinstated language that had been stricken from the rule in 1983. While the full scope of amendments might be in order as a consequence of this language, it is possible to analyze its potential impact based on past precedents and the limited experience of the 115 th Congress. The additional language opened the door to the consideration of retrenchments resulting from a reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States or the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. There are precedents regarding provisions allowed under the older, pre-1983 form of the rule that may be illustrative for understanding what might be in order. For example, a proposal that pay for a class of employees be limited to a smaller number of employees than authorized by law was allowed, as were proposals that would reduce the number of officers. The Holman rule also allowed proposals that would consolidate or eliminate offices. On at least one occasion, the Holman rule was the basis for allowing a proposal to replace civilian employees with lower paid U.S. Army enlisted personnel. In another case, the rule allowed for an amendment that capped the salaries of certain employees. In the 115 th Congress, one amendment was considered in order based on a plain reading of the text of the separate order to allow for \"the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Although the amendment failed of passage, it would have provided that: The salary of Mark Gabriel, the Administrator of the Western Area Power Administration, shall be reduced to $1. As cited above, however, neither the rule nor the separate order allows for retrenchments that would be applicable to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill. In addition, the application of the broader exceptions in the separate order were still subject to the general requirement for germaneness. The Holman rule is not intended to open the door for legislative provisions that would expand the scope of the bill. As a consequence, even with the additional scope provided by the language of the separate order, it would likely not be in order to include broad legislative provisions in, or amendments to, a specific appropriation bill that would apply to the salary or number of federal employees funded through appropriations in other measures. Furthermore, House precedent establishes that simply providing for a reduction of the number and salaries of officers in a paragraph when it is complicated by other elements does not necessarily bring a proposition within the exception. The Holman rule was also cited as the basis for allowing the consideration of one additional amendment during the 115 th Congress. That amendment also failed to pass, but it would have abolished the Budget Analysis Division of the Congressional Budget Office, comprising 89 employees with annual salaries aggregating $15 million, transferring responsibility for any duties imposed by law and regulation to the Office of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. When discussing the application of rules and precedents, it is important to note that the House Parliamentarian is the sole definitive authority on questions relating to the chamber's precedents and procedures and should be consulted if a formal opinion on any specific parliamentary question is desired.", "answers": ["Although congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding, House rules provide for exceptions in certain circumstances. One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

{"input": "", "context": "Federal law enforcement agencies and state coordinators in our survey— as well as officials we interviewed from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies—reported various uses of DOD excess controlled property for law enforcement activities. The reported uses included enhancing counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. Also, law enforcement agencies reported using DOD’s excess controlled property for other law enforcement activities, such as search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, reaching barricaded suspects, police training, and the serving of warrants. Federal, state, and local agencies cited a number of ways in which they had benefited from LESO program, with several reporting that the transfers of controlled property allowed them to save money. For example, a local law enforcement official in Texas reported that 96 percent of the department budget goes to salaries and that the LESO program helped the department acquire items that it would otherwise not be able to afford, saving the department an estimated $2 million to $3 million. Additionally, agencies provided examples of how property they received through the LESO program have been used. For example, the Bureau of Indian Affairs officials reported they have used vehicles to support their Office of Justice Services’ drug unit during marijuana eradication and border operations by providing transport to agents over inhospitable terrain in mountainous and desert environments. In another example, Texas law enforcement officials reported that the San Marcos and Hays County police departments used their issued Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to rescue more than 600 stranded people from floodwaters in October 2015. Moreover, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reported that it used a robot to remove a rifle from an attempted murder suspect who had barricaded himself. DLA has taken some steps to address previously identified weaknesses in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled property through revisions to its policy and procedures on the management, oversight, and accountability of the LESO program. Such revisions were made, in part, because of recommendations made by the DOD and DLA Offices of Inspector General. The DOD and DLA Offices of Inspector General conducted four audits of the LESO program between 2003 and 2013 that identified more than a dozen recommendations, such as developing and implementing written standard operating procedures for the approval and disapproval of law enforcement agency property requests and issuance, transfer, turn-in and disposal of LESO property. In our July 2017 report, we found the department had taken the following actions to enhance its transfer process through revisions to policy and procedures: transitioned full management responsibility of the LESO Program to DLA Disposition Services in 2009; developed LESO Program Standard Operating Procedures in 2012 and updated them in 2013; transitioned to a new data system in 2013 after identifying that the old system was not capable of post-issue tracking;revised the DLA instruction that provides policy, responsibility, and procedures for DLA’s management responsibilities of the LESO program in 2014 and 2016; and revised LESO program processes in 2016 to incorporate recommendations made by the Federal Interagency Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group, such as defining executive order controlled property or prohibiting schools K-12 from participating in the program. In addition, DLA is in the process of developing additional training on LESO program policies and procedures, and is establishing memorandums of understanding with federal law enforcement agencies on the general terms and conditions of participating in the program, including the restrictions on the transfer and sale of controlled property. We found weaknesses in three areas: (1) verifying and approving applications, (2) transferring property, and (3) the assessment of risk. First, our independent testing of the LESO program’s internal controls identified deficiencies in the processes for verification and approval of federal law enforcement agency applications. Specifically, our investigators posing as authorized federal law enforcement officials of a fictitious agency applied and were granted access to the LESO program in early 2017. In late 2016, we emailed our completed application to the LESO program office. Our application contained fictitious information including agency name, number of employees, point of contact, and physical location. In early 2017, after revising our application at the direction of LESO officials we were notified that our fictitious law enforcement agency was approved to participate in the LESO program. LESO officials also emailed us to request confirmation of our agency’s authorizing statute; in response, our investigators submitted fictitious authorizing provisions as provisions in the U.S. Code. At no point during the application process did LESO officials verbally contact officials at the agency we created—either the main point of contact listed on the application or the designated point of contact at a headquarters’ level—to verify the legitimacy of our application or to discuss establishing a memorandum of understanding with our agency. DLA’s internal controls for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment in the LESO program were not adequate to prevent the approval of a fraudulent application to obtain excess controlled property. Specifically, LESO’s reliance on electronic communications without actual verification does not allow it to properly vet for potentially fraudulent activity. For example, DLA did not require supervisory approval for all federal agency applications, or require confirmation of the application with designated points of contact at the headquarters of participating federal agencies. Additionally, at the time we submitted our application, DLA officials did not visit the location of the applying federal law enforcement agency to help verify the legitimacy of the application. After our briefing of DLA officials in March 2017 on the results of our investigative work, DLA officials stated they took immediate action, and in April 2017 visited 13 participating federal law enforcement agencies. However, at this time DLA has not reviewed and revised the policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment in the LESO program. Second, our independent testing also identified deficiencies in the transfer of controlled property, such as DLA personnel not routinely requesting and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer. Our investigators, after being approved to participate in the LESO program, obtained access to the department’s online systems to view and request controlled property. We subsequently submitted requests to obtain controlled property, including non-lethal items and potentially-lethal items if modified with commercially available items. In less than a week after submitting the requests, our fictitious agency was approved for the transfer of over 100 controlled property items with a total estimated value of about $1.2 million. The estimated value of each item ranged from $277 to over $600,000, including items such as night-vision goggles, reflex (also known as reflector) sights, infrared illuminators, simulated pipe bombs, and simulated rifles. Our investigator scheduled appointments and obtained the controlled property items, such as those shown in the photos below. Using fictitious identification and law enforcement credentials, along with the LESO-approved documentation, our investigator was able to pass security checks and enter the DLA Disposition Service warehouse sites. Personnel at two of the three sites did not request or check for valid identification of our investigator picking up the property. According to DLA guidance, direct pickup of allocated property may be made by an individual with valid identification and the appropriate DOD authorization form that is signed by the authorized individual listed in the letter. DLA has not taken steps to reasonably ensure that onsite officials routinely request and verify valid identification of the individual(s) authorized to pick up allocated property from the LESO program, as required by the guidance. DLA officials acknowledged they could take additional steps to ensure compliance with the requirements in the handbook. Furthermore, although we were approved to receive over 100 items and the transfer documentation reflects this amount, we were provided more items than we were approved to receive. The discrepancy involved one type of item—infrared illuminators. We requested 48 infrared illuminators but onsite officials at one Disposition Services site provided us with 51 infrared illuminators in 52 pouches, of which one pouch was empty. Additionally, we found that one DLA Disposition Services site had a checklist as a part of their transfer documentation for their personnel to complete. The checklist required manual completion of several items, including quantity, date, and who fulfilled the order. The other two DLA Disposition Services sites, including the site that transferred the wrong quantity, did not include this checklist with the transfer documentation we received. DLA guidance states that accountability records be maintained in auditable condition to allow property to be traced from receipt to final disposition. We concluded that without guidance that specifically requires DLA Disposition Services’ on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred prior to removal from the sites, DLA will lack reasonable assurance that the approved items transferred are appropriately reflected in their inventory records. Third, while DLA has taken some steps, mostly in early 2017, to address identified deficiencies in the LESO program, DLA lacks a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures. During the course of our review, DLA revised the LESO program applications by requiring applicants to sign an attestation that the agency that they represent is a legitimate law enforcement agency. Further, DLA officials stated they are more carefully reviewing the legitimacy of some information on the application such as email addresses and physically visiting federal agencies that enter into memorandums of understanding with the LESO program. However, as previously discussed, we identified internal controls weakness in the policy and procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment as well as weakness throughout the process from approval to the actual transfer of the items to the agencies, which indicates that DLA has not examined potential risks for all stages of the process. According to GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework, effective fraud risk managers collect and analyze data on identified fraud schemes, use these lessons learned to improve fraud risk management activities, and plan and conduct fraud risk assessments that are tailored to their programs. The framework states there is no universally accepted approach for conducting fraud risk assessments since circumstances among programs vary. However, per leading practices, assessing fraud risks generally involves five actions: (1) identifying inherent fraud risks affecting the program, (2) assessing the likelihood and effect of those fraud risks, (3) determining fraud risk tolerance, (4) examining the suitability of existing fraud controls and prioritizing residual fraud risks, and (5) documenting the program’s fraud risk profile. DLA has begun to examine some fraud risks associated with the LESO program. However, DLA officials acknowledged during our March 2017 meeting that they have not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program to include the application process, and as such, has not designed or implemented a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate risks to the program. We concluded that conducting such an assessment could have program-wide improvements, including strengthening the controls to verify the legitimacy of applicants. Overall, we concluded in our July 2017 report that DLA’s internal controls did not provide reasonable assurance in preventing fraud. Therefore, we made four recommendations for DLA to: review and revise policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment; ensure compliance that DLA Disposition Services on-site officials transferring controlled property verify that persons picking up items have valid identification and are authorized to pick up allocated property from the LESO program; issue guidance that requires DLA Disposition Services on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred prior to removal from the sites; and conduct a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks. DOD concurred with all of our recommendations and highlighted actions to address each one. Chairman Wilson, Ranking Member Bordallo, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes our prepared statement.

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has taken some actions and is planning additional actions to address identified weaknesses in its excess controlled property program. However, internal control deficiencies exist for, among other things, ensuring that only eligible applicants are approved to participate in the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program and receive transfers of excess controlled property. DLA is establishing memorandums of understanding with participating federal agencies intended to, among other things, establish general terms and conditions for participation, revise its program application to require additional prospective participant information, and plans to provide additional online training for participating agencies that is expected to begin in late 2017. However, GAO created a fictitious federal agency to conduct independent testing of the LESO program's internal controls and DLA's transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies. Through the testing, GAO gained access to the LESO program and obtained over 100 controlled items with an estimated value of $1.2 million, including night-vision goggles, simulated rifles, and simulated pipe bombs, which could be potentially lethal items if modified with commercially available items .

{"input": "", "context": "The leaders of the eight legislative branch agencies and entities—the Government Accountability Office, the Library of Congress, the Government Publishing Office (formerly Government Printing Office), the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, and the Office of Compliance—are appointed in a variety of manners. The first four agencies are led by a person appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The next two are appointed by Congress, the next by the Librarian of Congress, and the last by a board of directors. Congress has periodically examined the procedures used to appoint legislative branch officers with the aim of protecting the prerogatives of, and ensuring accountability to, Congress within the framework of the advice and consent appointment process established in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Legislation to alter the appointment process for legislative branch agencies and entities has periodically been introduced for many years. Questions remain about various reform proposals, including the ability of Congress to remove the President from the appointment process for some of these positions. These may depend upon the implication or interpretation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the definition of an \"officer of the United States,\" the specific office or agency in question, and whether or not a change in appointing authority would require any revision in the powers and duties of legislative branch agency leaders. Some previous reforms and proposals have also attempted to find a role for the House of Representatives, which does not play a formal role in the confirmation of presidential nominees, in the search for legislative branch officials. The report also briefly addresses legislation considered, but not enacted, in the 115 th Congress to change the appointment process for the Register of Copyrights. The following sections contain information on the legislative branch agency heads' appointment processes, length of tenures (if terms are set), reappointment or removal provisions (if any), salaries and benefi ts, and most recent appointments. Information is provided on each agency and summarized in Table 1 . Pursuant to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1990, the Architect is \"appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate for a term of 10 years.\" The act also established a congressional commission responsible for recommending individuals to the President for the position of Architect of the Capitol. The commission, originally consisting of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the chairs and the ranking minority Members of the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, was expanded in 1995 to include the chairs and ranking minority Members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Prior to 1989, the Architect was selected by the President for an unlimited term without any formal involvement of Congress. The FY1990 act, however, followed numerous attempts dating at least to the 1950s to alter the appointment procedure to provide a role for Congress. The proposals included requiring the advice and consent of the Senate, establishing a commission to recommend names to the President, and removing the appointment process from the President and instead making the Architect appointed solely by Congress. In the 111 th Congress, two measures ( H.R. 2185 and H.R. 2843 ) were introduced to remove the President from the Architect appointment process and shift it to congressional leaders and chairs and ranking Members of specific congressional committees. Under both measures, the Architect would still serve a 10-year term. Under H.R. 2843 , as reported, the Architect would have been appointed jointly by the same 14-member panel, equally divided between the House and Senate, that currently is responsible for recommending candidates to the President. This bill was reported by the Committee on House Administration ( H.Rept. 111-372 ) on December 10, 2009. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure was discharged from further consideration the same day. The House agreed to the bill, as amended to include an 18-member panel, also equally divided between the House and Senate, by voice vote on February 3, 2010. H.R. 2843 was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration, although no further action was taken. Under the earlier bill ( H.R. 2185 , 111 th Congress), which was introduced on April 30, 2009, the Architect would have been appointed jointly by the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, the minority leaders in the House and Senate, the chairs and ranking minority Members of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, and the chairs and ranking minority Members of the Committee on House Administration and Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. This bill followed similar legislation ( H.R. 6656 , 110 th Congress), with the same 12-member appointing panel, introduced on July 30, 2008. Both bills were referred to two committees, but no further action was taken. The Architect of the Capitol is compensated at an \"annual rate which is equal to the lesser of the annual salary for the Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives or the annual salary for the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate.\" Stephen T. Ayers was nominated by President Obama for a 10-year term on February 24, 2010. He was the second Architect nominated pursuant to the new commission procedure. The nomination was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The committee held a hearing on April 15, 2010, and Ayers was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on May 12, 2010. Ayers was previously the Deputy Architect/Chief Operating Officer and had served as Acting Architect of the Capitol following the February 4, 2007, retirement of former Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman. Upon the retirement of Ayers on November 23, 2018, Christine Merdon, the Deputy Architect of the Capitol/Chief Operating Officer, became the Acting Architect of the Capitol. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 703(a)(1), the Comptroller General shall be \"appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" This procedure dates to the establishment of the agency in 1921. Additionally, a commission procedure established in 1980 recommends individuals to the President in the event of a vacancy. The commission consists of the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate, the chairs and ranking minority Members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The commission is to recommend at least three individuals for this position to the President, although the President may request additional names. The Comptroller General is appointed to a 15-year term and may not be reappointed. The Comptroller General may be removed by \"(A) impeachment; or (B) joint resolution of Congress, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing\" and only by reason of permanent disability; inefficiency; neglect of duty; malfeasance; or a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude. The salary of the Comptroller General is equal to Level II of the Executive Schedule. Additionally, a law enacted in 1953 established a separate retirement system for the Comptroller General. Gene L. Dodaro, then-Chief Operating Officer at GAO, became the acting Comptroller General on March 13, 2008, upon the resignation of David M. Walker, who had previously been confirmed on October 21, 1998. The White House announced Dodaro's nomination to a 15-year term as Comptroller General on September 22, 2010. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on the nomination on November 18, 2010, and Dodaro was confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent on December 22, 2010. The Government Publishing Office (formerly Government Printing Office) was established in 1861. The U.S. Code , at 44 U.S.C. 301, states that the President \"shall nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint a suitable person to take charge of and manage the Government Publishing Office. The title shall be Director of the Government Publishing Office.\" The current appointment language was enacted in 2014, although the use of the advice and consent procedure for this position can be traced back much further. There is no set term of office for the Director. The Director's pay is equivalent to Level II of the Executive Schedule. Robert C. Tapella was nominated to be Director of the Government Publishing on June 18, 2018. The nomination was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. No further action was taken prior to the end of the 115 th Congress, and the nomination was returned to the President pursuant to Senate Rule XXXI. President Trump renominated Tapella on January 16, 2019. The nomination was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. Previously, Tapella served in this role from October 4, 2007 (confirmed by the Senate by voice vote) until December 28, 2010. GPO's Chief Administrative Officer, Herbert H. Jackson Jr., has served as Acting Deputy Director since July 1, 2018, following the retirement of Andrew M. Sherman. Sherman, formerly GPO's Chief of Staff, had been serving as Acting Deputy Director since the retirement of Acting GPO Director Jim Bradley on March 6, 2018. Bradley, previously the GPO Deputy Director, had assumed this role following the departure of the previous Director, Davita Vance-Cooks, in November 2017. Vance-Cooks had been nominated by President Obama on May 9, 2013, to be Public Printer, as the head of the GPO was then known, and confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on August 1, 2013. The Library of Congress was established in 1800. The U.S. Code , at 2 U.S.C. 136, states: \"The Librarian of Congress shall make rules and regulations for the government of the Library.\" Until an act of February 19, 1897, which made the appointment subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, the Librarian was appointed solely by the President. Recent changes to the appointment statute, at 2 U.S.C. 136-1, amended the tenure of the Librarian. The Librarian of Congress Succession Modernization Act of 2015, S. 2162 , was introduced in the Senate on October 7, 2015, and agreed to the same day by unanimous consent. It was agreed to in the House without objection on October 20 and signed by President Obama on November 5, 2015 ( P.L. 114-86 ). The act establishes a term limit of 10 years, with the possibility of reappointment by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Previously, there was no set term of office for the Librarian. The U.S. Code , at 2 U.S.C. 136a-2, states: \"the Librarian of Congress shall be compensated at an annual rate of pay which is equal to the annual rate of basic pay payable for positions at Level II of the Executive Schedule under section 5313 of title 5.\" Carla D. Hayden was nominated to a 10-year term as Librarian of Congress by President Obama on February 24, 2016. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on the nomination on April 20, 2016, and ordered the nomination favorably reported on June 9. Hayden was confirmed as the 14 th Librarian of Congress on July 13, 2016 (74-18, record vote number 128). Hayden succeeded James H. Billington who retired effective September 30, 2015. Billington had been confirmed as Librarian of Congress by the Senate on July 24, 1987. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 provides that the Librarian of Congress appoint the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) \"after consultation with the Joint Committee on the Library.\" The basic rate of pay for the director is equivalent to Level III of the Executive Schedule. There is no set term of office. Mary B. Mazanec, who served as Acting Director of CRS following the retirement of former Director Daniel P. Mulhollan on April 2, 2011, was appointed Director by the Librarian of Congress on December 5, 2011. 2 U.S.C. 1901 states: \"There shall be a captain of the Capitol police and such other members with such rates of compensation, respectively, as may be appropriated for by Congress from year to year. The Capitol Police shall be headed by a Chief who shall be appointed by the Capitol Police Board and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.\" The last sentence was inserted in 1979, struck by the FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, and restored in 2010 by the U.S. Capitol Police Administrative Technical Corrections Act. Pursuant to the FY2003 act, the chief of the Capitol Police receives compensation \"equal to $1,000 less than the lower of the annual rate of pay in effect for the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives or the annual rate of pay in effect for the Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate.\" Pay for the chief has been adjusted multiple times in recent years: it formerly was (1) equal to Level IV of the Executive Schedule under 1979 legislation, (2) linked to the Senior Executive Service under an act from 2000, and (3) equal to $2,500 less than these officers pursuant to a 2002 law. On February 24, 2016, the Capitol Police Board announced the appointment of Matthew R. Verderosa as the new Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, effective March 20, 2016. Previously, Chief Kim Dine was sworn in on December 17, 2012. The director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has been appointed wholly by Congress since the creation of the post with the passage of the Congressional Budget Act in 1974. The act stipulates that the director is appointed for a four-year term \"by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate after considering recommendations received from the Committees on the Budget of the House and the Senate, without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of his fitness to perform his duties.\" The director may be reappointed, and either chamber can remove the director by simple resolution. Additionally, a director appointed \"to fill a vacancy prior to the expiration of a term shall serve only for the unexpired portion of that term\" and an \"individual serving as Director at the expiration of a term may continue to serve until his successor is appointed.\" The director of CBO receives compensation at an annual rate that is equal to the lower of the highest annual rate of compensation of any officer of the House or any officer of the Senate. Keith Hall, the current director of CBO, began his service on April 1, 2015. He follows Douglas W. Elmendorf, who began his term on January 22, 2009. 2 U.S.C. 1382 states that the chair of the board of directors of the Office of Compliance, \"subject to the approval of the Board, shall appoint and may remove an Executive Director. Selection and appointment of the Executive Director shall be without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of fitness to perform the duties of the Office.\" The executive director must be \"an individual with training or expertise in the application of laws referred to in section 1302(a)\" of Title II of the U.S. Code . The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act altered the compensation for the Office's statutorily established positions, including that of the executive director. The chair of the board may fix the annual rate of pay for the executive director, although the level may not exceed the lesser of House or Senate officers. Prior to the FY2008 act, the maximum pay for this position had been Level V of the Executive Schedule. Separate legislation, P.L. 110-164 , amended the Congressional Accountability Act and altered eligibility and tenure restrictions for the executive director by allowing current or former Office of Compliance employees to serve in this capacity. The legislation also permits the executive director, deputy executive directors, and general counsel, who formerly were limited to one five-year term in their positions, to serve up to two terms. Susan Tsui Grundmann was appointed to a five-year term as executive director commencing January 2017. She succeeded Barbara J. Sapin, who was appointed in 2013. During the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate considered legislation that would alter the appointment of one position within one of these agencies—the Register of Copyrights. Under current law pertaining to the copyright office (17 U.S.C. 701): All administrative functions and duties ... are the responsibility of the Register of Copyrights as director of the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. The Register of Copyrights, together with the subordinate officers and employees of the Copyright Office, shall be appointed by the Librarian of Congress, and shall act under the Librarian's general direction and supervision. H.R. 1695 and S. 1010 , the Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act, would have made the Register of Copyrights a presidential appointment, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. The legislation would have established a seven-person panel to recommend at least three candidates for this position to the President. The panel would consist of the Speaker of the House, President pro tempore of the Senate, majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, and Librarian of Congress. The bills would have established a 10-year term of office for the Register. H.R. 1695 was reported by the House Judiciary Committee on April 20, 2017 ( H.R. 1695 , H.Rept. 115-91 ), and passed in the House, as amended, on April 26 (378–48, Roll no. 227). The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on September 26, 2018. A Senate committee markup of S. 1010 initially scheduled for December 12, 2018, was postponed. No further action was taken during the 115 th Congress. The office is currently led by Acting Register of Copyrights Karyn A.

{"input": "", "context": "Established by Congress as an amendment to the Clean Air Act, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates that U.S. transportation fuels contain a minimum volume of biofuel. The mandated minimum volume increases annually and must be met using both conventional biofuel (e.g., corn starch ethanol) and advanced biofuel (e.g., cellulosic ethanol). For a renewable fuel to be applied toward the mandate, it must be used for certain purposes (i.e., transportation fuel, jet fuel, or heating oil) and meet certain environmental and biomass feedstock criteria. A variety of factors, such as infrastructure, technology, and limited federal assistance, have led to challenges in meeting the total volume requirement established by Congress. These challenges have included a lack of cellulosic biofuel production and delays by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in approving fuel pathways. Further, it is not clear how changes in gasoline consumption in response to fluctuating crude oil and gasoline prices impact the biofuel or conventional fuel industries. It is also uncertain how the program will fare once EPA implements the \"reset\" provision of the statute, which allows the agency to modify the volumes required for future years (starting in 2016) if certain conditions are met. In addition, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the transparency of the market wherein credits are traded to demonstrate compliance with the mandate. Lastly, there is concern by some biofuel producers that the Trump Administration's issuance of multiple small refinery exemptions has adversely affected, or will adversely affect, biofuel demand. Small refiners may petition the EPA Administrator for an exemption from the RFS mandate if they can prove disproportionate economic hardship. There are, however, two fuel categories that have consistently met their statutory targets: conventional biofuel and biomass-based diesel. Also, since 2014, two advanced biofuel pathways—renewable compressed natural gas and renewable liquefied natural gas—have constituted the majority of the cellulosic biofuel volume target established by EPA. Challenges in implementing the RFS have led to scrutiny of the program in Congress and to litigation about EPA's regulations. Largely due to concerns about the implementation and feasibility of the RFS, some Members of Congress have expressed their perspectives on EPA's proposed and final rules as well as EPA's implementation of the program. They also have questioned whether to amend or repeal the RFS or whether to maintain the status quo. This report provides a basic description of the RFS, including some of the widely discussed policy issues related to it. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ; EPAct05) and expanded in 2007 by the Energy Independence and Security Act ( P.L. 110-140 ; EISA). The RFS mandate requires that transportation fuels sold or introduced into commerce in the United States contain an increasing volume of a predetermined suite of renewable fuels. The statute required 4.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006, ascending to 36.0 billion gallons required in 2022, with EPA determining the volume amounts after 2022 in future rulemakings. The statute centers on four renewable fuel categories—conventional biofuel, advanced biofuel, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel—each with its own target volume. The total renewable fuel requirement under the RFS is met with the combination of fuels from two renewable fuel categories: conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel. The requirement for advanced biofuel, in general, can be met with the combination of three types of advanced biofuel: cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, and other advanced biofuels. To date, the total annual volumes required have been met mostly with conventional biofuel (e.g., corn starch ethanol). Beginning in 2015, the mandate capped the conventional biofuel volume amounts while increasing the requirement for advanced biofuels. For instance, the statutory RFS total advanced biofuel requirement increases over time from approximately 7% of the RFS in 2010 to 58% of the RFS in 2022. A key part of the statutory definition of each fuel category is whether the fuel achieves certain greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions relative to gasoline and diesel fuel. Each fuel is assigned a lifecycle GHG emission threshold (in proportion to baseline lifecycle GHG emissions for gasoline and diesel). For example, a fuel must achieve at least a 50% GHG reduction to be considered an advanced biofuel , at least a 60% reduction to be considered a cellulosic biofuel , and at least a 50% reduction to be considered biomass-based diesel . Similarly, biofuel from new facilities—those built after enactment of the 2007 law—must achieve at least a 20% GHG reduction to qualify as a conventional renewable fuel. EPA regulates compliance with the RFS using a tradable credit system. Obligated parties (generally, refiners) submit credits—called renewable identification numbers (RINs)—to EPA that equal the number of gallons in their annual obligation. This annual obligation, referred to as the renewable volume obligation (RVO), is the obligated party's total gasoline and diesel sales multiplied by the annual renewable fuel percentage standards announced by EPA. RINs are valid for use in the year they are generated and the following year. Obligated parties may carry a deficit from one year to the next, but in the year following the deficit, the obligated party must meet compliance for that year's renewable fuel volume requirement and purchase or generate enough credits to satisfy the deficit from the previous year. RINs may be used by the party that generates them or they may be traded with other parties. The EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) is used to register RIN transactions. Different biofuels are not treated equally within the RFS. The categories are nested within each other, such that some fuels qualify for multiple categories (e.g., cellulosic ethanol), while others (mainly corn starch ethanol) may only be used to meet the overall RFS but not the advanced category or its nested subcategories. For example, a gallon of cellulosic biofuel may be used to meet the cellulosic biofuel mandate, the advanced biofuel mandate, and the total renewable fuel mandate, possibly making it a more highly valued fuel. In addition, some biofuels generate more RINs per volume than others because of the difference in the fuel's energy content. This difference is accounted for by a metric referred to as the equivalence value (EV) of the biofuel. The EV of a renewable fuel represents the number of gallons that can be claimed for compliance purposes for every physical gallon of renewable fuel used, and it is generally the ratio of the energy content of a gallon of the fuel to a gallon of ethanol. For example, because biodiesel has an EV of 1.5 when being used as an advanced biofuel, 1,000 physical gallons of biodiesel would equal 1,500 RIN gallons of advanced biofuels. EPA released the final rule for the RFS for 2019 on November 30, 2018. The rule calls for 19.92 billion gallons of total renewable fuel for 2019—a 1% increase from the 19.29 billion gallons required in 2018 (see Table 1 ). The conventional biofuel volume requirement remains at 15.00 billion gallons. The volume requirements set by EPA for 2019 for total renewable fuel, advanced biofuel, and cellulosic biofuel are all less than the volumes called for in statute but greater than the previous year's volumes—an annual occurrence that started in 2014. EPA used the cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the statutory volumes. EPA reduced the statutory targets for both advanced biofuel and total renewable by the same amount as the reduction for the cellulosic biofuel (i.e., 8.08 billion gallons). EPA reports that the advanced biofuel statutory target of 13.0 billion gallons \"cannot be reached in 2019 … primarily due to the expected continued shortfall in cellulosic biofuel.\" EPA estimates there are 2.59 billion carryover RINs available. In its response to comments regarding the rule, EPA mentions a forthcoming reset rulemaking. EPA set the biomass-based diesel 2020 volume requirement at 2.43 billion gallons. Biomass-based diesel is the predominant biofuel used to satisfy the advanced biofuel portion of the mandate. Previously, it has been used to backfill the overall advanced biofuel requirement if another advanced biofuel fell short (e.g., cellulosic biofuel). EPA reports \"the advanced biofuel volume requirement is driving the production and use of biodiesel and renewable diesel volumes over and above volumes required through the separate BBD [biomass-based diesel] standard\" and that the 2020 volume requirement \"provides sufficient incentive to producers of 'other' advanced biofuels.\" EPA acknowledges that it took into consideration the unavailability of the biodiesel tax credit for 2019, the tariffs on imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia, the tariffs on soybeans exported to China, and more in its assessment of the biodiesel requirement for 2020. Implementation of the RFS has been complex, and compliance with some of its parts has been challenging, according to some stakeholders. This section briefly explains some of the general concerns and challenges with implementing the RFS. EPA administers the RFS. This responsibility includes evaluating renewable fuel pathways eligible for the RFS. In addition, EPA is required to evaluate the ability of the biofuel industry to produce enough fuel to meet the annual volume standard, release an annual volume standard based on its research findings, and ensure that annual compliance by obligated parties is met. All of the above must be completed annually, taking into consideration comments from other government agencies, the public, and, recently, court decisions. These responsibilities could be viewed as an addition to EPA's regulatory workload and have required EPA to develop new capabilities to carry them out. For several years following the 2010 issuance of the amended RFS final rule, EPA has had difficulty projecting certain volume requirements (e.g., cellulosic biofuels) which have led EPA to use its waiver authority to set annual volume requirements for cellulosic biofuel, total advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel different from what was stated in the statute. Legal challenges have been brought against the EPA regarding some of these annual fuel volume projections. For instance, the American Petroleum Institute objected to EPA's 2012 cellulosic biofuel production projection, among other things, and challenged it in court. The federal court vacated the 2012 cellulosic biofuel standard and provided principles for EPA to apply to future annual projections. Likewise, Americans for Clean Energy and other petitioners challenged various aspects of the final rule that set the volume requirements and projections for 2014-2016 and 2017 for biomass-based diesel, including EPA's interpretation of \"inadequate domestic supply\" in exercising its general waiver authority to reduce the total volume requirements. The D.C. Circuit Court vacated EPA's 2016 total renewable fuel volume requirement and remanded the 2015 final rule to EPA for reconsideration consistent with the court's decision. In some instances the timing of EPA's RFS regulatory actions, such as the annual announcement of the renewable fuel volume requirements, has not met statutory deadlines. The most recent final rules, including the 2019 final rule, adhere to the statutory schedule. However, some of the earlier final rules did not meet the statutory deadline. A lack of timely rulemaking combined with inaccurate volume projections could affect private investment, according to some advanced biofuel producers. Regardless, they lead to uncertainty in compliance for obligated parties. The amount of time it takes the agency to approve new fuel pathways and register new facilities has been raised in public comments to proposed RFS rules. Slow approval could stifle investment and production of new fuels. Further, prolonged processing time for some program enhancement rules—such as the Proposed Renewables Enhancement and Growth Support Rule (REGS rule)—may impede the growth of the program. Lastly, the final rule for 2014 through 2016 triggered the \"reset\" provision of the RFS for the advanced biofuel and cellulosic biofuel categories. The 2019 final rule triggered the \"reset\" provision for total renewable fuel. Thus, three of the four renewable fuel categories identified in statute are subject to being \"reset\" by the EPA Administrator. The reset provision gives the EPA Administrator authority to adjust the applicable volumes of the RFS for future years starting in 2016 if certain conditions are met. How EPA implements this provision will affect renewable fuel production and compliance with the overall program. EPA reports that it will issue a rulemaking in early 2019 that proposes to reset the cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel volume targets for the years 2020-2022. As noted above, there are a number of nested categories within the RFS; a fuel may qualify as a biofuel for one or more portions of the mandate. Difficulty by some advanced biofuel producers in understanding which advanced biofuels qualify for the RFS can lead to challenges in determining how compliance is being met. Not all fuels from a renewable source are eligible under the RFS. The RFS operates as a biofuel standard, with priority assigned to liquid transportation fuels from biomass feedstocks. Other renewable sources (e.g., wind) do not qualify. Before a fuel can generate RFS RINs, however, that fuel pathway must be approved by EPA; according to advanced biofuel producers that process can take a considerable amount of time for some fuels. Lastly, some may view the RFS as a biofuel production mandate. The statutory language does not mandate the production of biofuels; rather, it mandates the use of biofuel. However, it could be argued that it is difficult to use a fuel that is not being produced and that the RFS therefore indirectly creates a demand for certain biofuels and thus stimulates their production. By statute, cellulosic biofuel is targeted to comprise approximately 44% of the total renewable fuel mandate in 2022. However, the annual cellulosic biofuel production volume established by Congress is not being met. Actual cellulosic biofuel production volumes (e.g., cellulosic ethanol) are below the expectations set when the law was passed. For instance, in 2019, the statute requires 8.5 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel. EPA set the 2019 target volume at 418 million gallons for 2019. This shortfall is due to several factors, including lack of private investment, technology setbacks, and uneven support from the federal government. These factors, coupled with the fact that annual volumes in the statute were established when market conditions for raising investment capital for new biofuel technologies were more favorable, may suggest unrealistic targets for some advanced biofuels for the near future. These production limitations have raised questions about whether the statutory cellulosic biofuel volumes are attainable. The \"blend wall\"—the upper limit to the total amount of ethanol that can be blended into U.S. gasoline and still maintain automobile performance and comply with the Clean Air Act—has been viewed by many to be in direct conflict with the biofuel volumes mandated in the RFS. Thus far, the largest volume being met under the RFS is for the nonadvanced (conventional) biofuel segment of the mandate, met mainly with corn starch ethanol blended into gasoline. Due to a variety of factors, ethanol content in gasoline is generally limited to 10% (E10). With a relatively fixed supply of gasoline, the amount of ethanol that can be supplied this way is also limited. If the ethanol content of gasoline for the majority of vehicles remains at 10%, and given current fuel consumption rates, the conventional biofuel portion of the RFS is requiring slightly more ethanol than can technically be blended into gasoline. While the blend wall remains a concern, it may not be as significant an impediment to immediate fuel consumption as previously considered by some. Indeed, EPA reports \"the E10 blendwall is not the barrier that some stakeholders believe it to be.\" Had the RFS mandates—for both conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel—come to fruition in the form of mostly ethanol, or had fuel consumption decreased further, the blend wall potentially could have led to more discussion about the volume mandates. However, primarily due to the lack of cellulosic biofuel production, more time has been granted to address the blend wall and the scheduled levels of biofuels in the RFS. Some possible approaches could alleviate blend wall concerns in the near term. One option suggested by some is to blend higher levels of ethanol into conventional gasoline. In 2010 EPA granted a Clean Air Act waiver that allows gasoline to contain up to 15% ethanol for use in model year 2001 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. However, limited demand, infrastructure and automobile warranty concerns, and the lack of a waiver to sell E15 during the summer months, have precluded widespread offering and purchase of E15, gasoline blended with 10.5% to 15% ethanol. Widespread use of E15 could potentially postpone the blend wall for a few years. Another option to address the blend wall would be an aggressive push for the use of ethanol in flexible-fuel vehicles capable of using E85, a gasoline-ethanol blend containing 51% to 83% ethanol. However, there are infrastructure constraints with the use of E85. For example, the number of E85 fueling stations is limited. To help address these infrastructure issues, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced $100 million in matching grants in 2015 under its Biofuel Infrastructure Partnership. The grants may be used for blender pumps, dedicated E15 or E85 pumps, and new storage tanks and related equipment associated with new facilities or additional capacity. The RFS is not a stand-alone policy. It interacts with many factors that are not easily controlled. For example, cellulosic biofuel production, at a minimum, requires conversion technology, which itself requires technical expertise and time to ramp up to commercial scale. The large quantity of biomass feedstocks needed to produce such biofuels requires factors such as appropriate weather conditions and an expectation of stable markets for feedstock commodities. Further, some types of biofuel production thus far have been sensitive to the availability of tax incentives in order to be economically feasible (e.g., biodiesel). Unexpected occurrences (e.g., drought, failed technology, tax incentive expiration) could potentially impact an entire industry, especially for some advanced biofuels in nascent industries compared to conventional transportation fuels. The RFS was established in 2005 at a time when Congress foresaw the need to diversify the country's energy portfolio, strengthen the economy of rural communities that could contribute to biofuel production, bolster U.S. standing in an emerging segment of the energy technology market, and protect the environment, among other objectives. The RFS was then subsequently expanded in 2007. Over the past decade some components of the RFS have progressed steadily toward meeting statutory requirements and other components have not. The RFS is a program with ambitious objectives. Policy questions surrounding future consideration of the RFS might include What should be the purposes of the RFS? Is the RFS properly designed to achieve those purposes? What happens when, and if, the RFS achieves its purposes? At the outse t, some would argue that the first question may seem straightforward; the RFS exists to introduce more biofuels into the transportation fuel market to achieve a number of transportation fuel supply and environmental objectives. However, the statute does not list any specific purposes or objectives. Some stakeholders argue that the RFS exists primarily to find another market for biomass feedstocks or to promote the economy of rural America (e.g., the construction of biofuel facilities that create jobs). To the extent the RFS was designed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, and to the extent that hydraulic fracturing and the growth of unconventional oil and gas production have contributed to achieving that objective, some stakeholders have questioned whether the RFS is still needed for energy security purposes. Likewise, the environmental impact of the RFS could be challenged, as the advanced biofuel component of the RFS—set to yield greater greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits—has missed the statutory targets by a large margin. In examining whether the RFS is well designed to realize its general purpose, some have inquired about the challenges in achieving the ambitious RFS targets, given concerns about the slow development of some advanced biofuel supplies. Additionally, past delays in announcing final annual standards by EPA have led to uncertainty for biofuel producers, feedstock growers, and refiners. Whether the RFS should be eliminated, amended to address the current challenges in the program, or maintained in its current form is an ongoing question for Congress. A related question is whether the current provisions for EPA to waive various portions of the RFS mandates and to reset the RFS are sufficient to address the current supply challenges or whether the use of these waivers runs counter to the goals of the program. Some Members of Congress have proposed alternatives to the RFS, such as transitioning to an octane standard. Other Members of Congress have expressed interest in modifying or eliminating the conventional biofuel (e.g., corn starch ethanol) portion of the mandate. Some contend that the conventional biofuel segment of the biofuels industry is well established, so it should not require a use mandate. In addition, it has been argued that a demand for conventional biofuels exists regardless of congressional involvement. Others counter that the RFS is needed to help lower GHG emissions and to assure that the biofuels industry continues to have access to a fuel distribution infrastructure that is largely controlled by petroleum interests.", "answers": ["The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. The RFS—established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58; EPAct05) and expanded in 2007 by the Energy Independence and Security Act (P.L. 110-140; EISA)—began with 4 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006 and aims to ascend to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has statutory authority to determine the volume amounts after 2022. The total renewable fuel statutory target consists of both conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel. Since 2014, the total renewable fuel statutory target has not been met, with the advanced biofuel portion falling below the statutory target by a large margin since 2015. Going forward, it is unlikely that the United States will meet the total renewable fuel target as outlined in statute. EPA administers the RFS and is responsible for several tasks. For instance, within statutory criteria EPA evaluates which renewable fuels are eligible for the RFS program. Also, EPA establishes the amount of renewable fuel that will be required for the coming year based on fuel supply and other conditions although waiver authority in the statute allows the EPA Administrator to reduce the statutory volumes if necessary. Further, the statute requires that the EPA Administrator \"reset\" the RFS—whereby the fuel volumes required for future years are modified by the Administrator if certain conditions are met. EPA monitors compliance for the RFS using a system of tradable credits referred to as renewable identification numbers (RINs). Congress has expressed ongoing interest in the RFS, particularly as the mandate relates to other legislative efforts (e.g., Reid Vapor Pressure requirements for ethanol-gasoline fuel blends containing greater than 10% ethanol, a national octane standard) and about oversight of the RIN market, among other things. Some assert it is time to amend or repeal the RFS, while others contend the best course of action is to maintain the status quo. For instance, some Members contend the RFS hurts consumers by creating an artificial market for ethanol. Others see ethanol as a part of a competitive energy strategy. Congress may also express interest in how the EPA Administrator applies the RFS \"reset\" authority.

{"input": "", "context": "The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress is the most recent effort of the House of Representatives to examine its internal procedures and operations through the use of a specialized committee, commission, or party conference or caucus group. The original Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress was constituted during the 79 th Congress (1945-1946) for the purpose of strengthening the role of Congress and its committees in the lawmaking process. In 1965, Congress reincarnated this joint committee to suggest additional changes in how the two chambers operate, and the committee was reconstituted during the 102 nd and 103 rd Congresses (1991-1994). While these efforts were bicameral in nature, other examinations of congressional operations, such as that being undertaken by this panel, have been focused primarily on the House. On January 4, 2019, the House established the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress by adopting Title II of H.Res. 6 , the House rules package for the 116 th Congress (2019-2020), on a 418-12 vote. The stated purpose of the select committee is \"to investigate, study, make findings, hold public hearings, and develop recommendations on modernizing Congress.\" The select committee's authorization ends on February 1, 2020, and any activities beyond that date would require additional authorization. Twelve Members have been appointed by the Speaker to the select committee in accordance with H.Res. 6 , six of whom were appointed on the recommendation of the minority leader. The committee's authorizing resolution further requires the membership of the committee to include two freshman Members, two Members from the Committee on Rules, and two Members from the Committee on House Administration. The membership of this committee differs from that of other committees in three key ways: 1. Party ratios on committees generally reflect the overall party balance in the chamber. The select committee, however, is composed of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans (like the House Ethics Committee). 2. Service on the select committee does not count toward the committee membership limitations in House Rule X. 3. Members of the select committee are appointed by the Speaker based in part on recommendations of the minority leader. By comparison, placement on a standing committee generally occurs on the basis of a three-step process: first, recommendations of a party's steering committee are made; second, each party must approve those recommendations; third, committee assignment resolutions ratifying each party's selections are adopted on the House floor. On January 4, 2019, Speaker Pelosi selected Representative Derek Kilmer (WA) to serve as chair of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. On January 29, 2019, the Speaker appointed the five additional Democratic Members: Emanuel Cleaver (MO), Suzan DelBene (WA), Zoe Lofgren (CA), Mark Pocan (WI), and Mary Gay Scanlon (PA). On February 11, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy recommended the six GOP Members: Tom Graves (vice chair, GA), Rob Woodall (GA), Susan Brooks (IN), Rodney Davis (IL), Dan Newhouse (WA), and William Timmons (SC). Section two of the select committee's authorizing resolution (Title II of H.Res. 6 ) created a set of procedures specific to the select committee that will help guide the committee's work during its year-long operation. These rules supplement House Rules X and XI, which govern most committee procedure that applies to the select committee, with certain exceptions. No legislative jurisdiction was delegated to the committee—introduced measures will not be referred to it. The committee has the broad responsibility to study House operations with an eye toward modernizing the conduct of its business. In particular, the committee is charged with investigating the following seven areas: 1. rules to promote a more modern and efficient Congress; 2. procedures, including the schedule and calendar; 3. policies to develop the next generation of leaders; 4. staff recruitment, diversity, retention, and compensation and benefits; 5. administrative efficiencies, including purchasing, travel, outside services, and shared administrative staff; 6. technology and innovation; and 7. the work of the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards (Franking Commission). Building on the requirements of H.Res. 6, the select committee by a unanimous vote agreed to additional rules of procedure at its first meeting, held on March 12, 2019. The committee established its regular meeting day (the first Tuesday of each month), quorum requirements for various committee activities, and how the committee intends to conduct its questioning of invited witnesses. It takes two Members to make a quorum for a hearing, one-third for a markup (for instance, of any report the committee might release), and a majority \"actually present\" to issue a report. Committee rules also incentivize on-time arrival at a hearing with \"early-bird\" rules allowing Members present at the start to question witnesses before late-arrivers. The chair (Representative Kilmer) and vice chair (Representative Graves) are provided five minutes each to make opening statements, and the chair may recognize others to make opening statements as well. Committee rules place an overall time limit of 10 minutes for opening statements. Questioning witnesses occurs under the five-minute rule, and any committee member may submit to the chair \"questions for the record\" (written questions to witnesses who appeared) within 10 business days of a hearing. Although the committee is not authorized to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents, it \"may recommend subpoenas and depositions and submit such recommendations to the relevant standing committee.\" On March 26, 2019, the Committee on House Administration reported H.Res. 245 , a resolution to fund House standing and select committees during the 116 th Congress, which the House agreed to the following day. This resolution authorized $487,500 for expenditures of the select committee during the course of its investigation. With operations of the select committee scheduled to end on February 1, 2020, all but $37,500 of this amount has been reserved for use during the first session of the 116 th Congress (2019). Prior to the adoption of H.Res. 245 , the select committee was provided with interim funding. In addition, pursuant to H.Res. 6 , the select committee may use the services of House staff. Consistent with its mandate, the committee's first hearing (March 12) was held for the purpose of receiving testimony from Members themselves regarding any suggested improvements to congressional operations. Thirty-five Members testified before the committee to present their own reform ideas spanning a wide range of subjects—for instance, changes to the standing rules, family-friendly adjustments to the House schedule, additional resources to support the work of Congress, and ways to delegate more policymaking responsibilities to individual Members. The committee's next three hearings (held on March 27, May 1, and May 10) included testimony from Capitol Hill practitioners, former Members, scholars, and others on a number of proposals the committee might consider in making its own recommendations. Additional hearings and other meetings are likely to be convened throughout calendar year 2019, and information on current and upcoming activities of the committee can be found on its official website. H.Res. 6 states that the select committee \"shall submit a final report to the House.\" The final report is to include the committee's findings and any policy recommendations it might have. Documents produced by House committees generally require a majority of the committee with a quorum present to support their publication. In the case of the select committee, a higher threshold of two-thirds is required to publish its final report. Given that the committee is composed of six Members from each party, some amount of bipartisan support will be needed to publish the final report. If all committee members are present for this vote, support from at least 8 of the 12 would be needed to meet the two-thirds threshold. House rules generally require committees to make their proceedings and written documents available to the public within a specified period of time. The select committee is not excepted from this obligation. As specified in Committee Rule 6, \"documents reflecting the proceedings of the Committee shall be made publicly available ... not more than 24 hours after each meeting has adjourned.\" After the committee's work is concluded, any records it produced during the course of its investigation will be distributed to the relevant standing committee(s) as designated by the Speaker, and any recommendations offered by the committee in its final report must be made public within 30 days of its submission to the House. The below CRS experts are available to answer inquiries from congressional clients concerning the topics specified.", "answers": ["On January 4, 2019, the House established the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress by adopting Title II of H.Res. 6, the House rules package for the 116th Congress (2019-2020), on a 418-12 vote. The purpose of the select committee as stated in its authorizing resolution is \"to investigate, study, make findings, hold public hearings, and develop recommendations on modernizing Congress.\" Twelve Members, six from each party, have been selected by their leadership to serve on the select committee during its year-long investigation.

{"input": "", "context": "Our past work has identified progress and challenges in a number of areas related to DHS’s management of the CFATS program including (1) the process for identifying high risk chemical facilities; (2) how it assesses risk and prioritizes facilities; (3) reviewing and approving facility security plans; (4) how it conducts facility compliance inspections; and (5) efforts to conduct stakeholder outreach and gather feedback. DHS has made a number of programmatic changes to CFATS in recent years that may also impact its progress in addressing our open recommendations; these changes are included as part of our ongoing review of the program. In May 2014, we found that more than 1,300 facilities had reported having ammonium nitrate to DHS. However, based on our review of state data and records, there were more facilities with ammonium nitrate holdings than those that had reported to DHS under the CFATS program. Thus, we concluded that some facilities that were required to report may have failed to do so. We recommended that DHS work with other agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to develop and implement methods of improving data sharing among agencies and with states as members of a Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group. DHS agreed with our recommendation and has since addressed it. Specifically, DHS compared DHS data with data from other federal agencies, such as EPA, as well as member states from the Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group to identify potentially noncompliant facilities. As a result of this effort, in July 2015, DHS officials reported that they had identified about 1,000 additional facilities that should have reported information to comply with CFATS and subsequently contacted these facilities to ensure compliance. DHS officials told us that they continue to engage with states to identify potentially non-compliant facilities. For example, as of June 2018, DHS officials stated they have received 43 lists of potentially noncompliant facilities from 34 state governments, which are in various stages of review by DHS. DHS officials also told us that they recently hired an individual to serve as the lead staff member responsible for overseeing this effort. DHS has also taken action to strengthen the accuracy of data it uses to identify high risk facilities. In July 2015, we found that DHS used self- reported and unverified data to determine the risk categorization for facilities that held toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. At the time, DHS required that facilities self- report the Distance of Concern—an area in which exposure to a toxic chemical cloud could cause serious injury or fatalities from short-term exposure—as part of its Top-Screen. We estimated that more than 2,700 facilities with a toxic release threat had misreported the Distance of Concern and therefore recommended that DHS (1) develop a plan to implement a new Top-Screen to address errors in the Distance of Concern submitted by facilities, and (2) identify potentially miscategorized facilities that could cause the greatest harm and verify that the Distance of Concern of these facilities report is accurate. DHS has fully addressed both of these recommendations. Specifically, DHS implemented an updated Top-Screen in October 2016 and now collects data from facilities and calculates the Distance of Concern itself, rather than relying on the facilities’ calculation. In response to our second recommendation, in November 2016, DHS officials stated they completed an assessment of all Top-Screens that reported threshold quantities of toxic release chemicals of interest and identified 158 facilities with the potential to cause the greatest harm. As of May 2017, according to ISCD officials, 156 of the 158 facilities submitted updated Top-Screens and 145 of the 156 Top-Screens had undergone a quality assurance review process. DHS has also taken actions to better assess regulated facilities’ risks in order to place the facilities into the appropriate risk tier. In April 2013, we reported that DHS’s risk assessment approach did not consider all of the elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. Our work showed that DHS’s risk assessment was based primarily on consequences from human casualties, but did not consider economic consequences, as called for by the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and the CFATS regulation. We also found that (1) DHS’s approach was not consistent with the NIPP because it treated every facility as equally vulnerable to a terrorist attack regardless of location or on-site security and (2) DHS was not using threat data for 90 percent of the tiered facilities—those tiered for the risk of theft or diversion—and using 5-year-old threat data for the remaining 10 percent of those facilities that were tiered for the risks of release or sabotage. We recommended that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk and conduct a peer review after doing so. DHS agreed with our recommendations and has made progress towards addressing them. Specifically, with regard to our recommendation that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk, DHS worked with Sandia National Laboratories to develop a model to estimate the economic consequences of a chemical attack. In addition, DHS worked with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to devise a new tiering methodology, called the Second Generation Risk Engine. In so doing, DHS revised the CFATS threat, vulnerability, and consequence scoring methods to better cover the range of CFATS security issues. Additionally, with regard to our recommendation that DHS conduct a peer review after enhancing its risk assessment approach, DHS conducted peer reviews and technical reviews with government organizations and facility owners and operators, and worked with Sandia National Laboratories to verify and validate the new tiering approach. We are currently reviewing the reports and data that DHS has provided about its new tiering methodology as part of our ongoing work and will report on the results of this work later this summer. To further enhance its risk assessment approach, in fall 2016, DHS also revised its Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT), which supports DHS efforts to gather information from facilities to assess their risk. According to DHS officials, the new tool—called CSAT 2.0—is intended to eliminate duplication and confusion associated with DHS’s original CSAT. DHS officials told us that they have improved the tool by revising some questions in the original CSAT to make them easier to understand; eliminating some questions; and pre-populating data from one part of the tool to another so that users do not have to retype the same information multiple times. DHS officials also told us that the facilities that have used the CSAT 2.0 have provided favorable feedback that the new tool is more efficient and less burdensome than the original CSAT. Finally, DHS officials told us that as of June 2018, DHS has completed all notifications and has processed tiering results for all but 226 facilities. DHS officials stated they are currently working to identify correct points of contact to update registration information for these remaining facilities. We are currently assessing DHS’s efforts to assess risk and prioritize facilities as part of our ongoing work and will report on the results of this work in our report later this summer. DHS has also made progress reviewing and approving facility site security plans by reducing the time it takes to review these plans and eliminating the backlog of plans awaiting review. In April 2013, we reported that DHS revised its procedures for reviewing facilities’ security plans to address DHS managers’ concerns that the original process was slow, overly complicated, and caused bottlenecks in approving plans. We estimated that it could take DHS another 7 to 9 years to review the approximately 3,120 plans in its queue at that time. We also estimated that, given the additional time needed to do compliance inspections, the CFATS program would likely be implemented in 8 to 10 years. We did not make any recommendations for DHS to improve its procedures for reviewing facilities’ security plans because DHS officials reported that they were exploring ways to expedite the process, such as reprioritizing resources and streamlining inspection requirements. In July 2015, we reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS officials attributed the increased approval rate to efficiencies in DHS’s review process, updated guidance, and a new case management system. Subsequently, DHS reported in its December 2016 semi-annual report to Congress that it had eliminated its approval backlog. Finally, we found in our 2017review that DHS also took action to implement an Expedited Approval Program (EAP). The CFATS Act of 2014 required that DHS create the EAP as another option that tier 3 and tier 4 chemical facilities may use to develop and submit security plans to DHS. Under the program, facilities may develop a security plan based on specific standards published by DHS (as opposed to the more flexible performance standards using the standard, non-expedited process). DHS issued guidance intended to help facilities prepare and submit their EAP security plans to DHS, which includes an example that identifies prescriptive security measures that facilities are to have in place. According to committee report language, the EAP was expected to reduce the regulatory burden on smaller chemical companies, which may lack the compliance infrastructure and the resources of large chemical facilities, and help DHS to process security plans more quickly. If a tier 3 or 4 facility chooses to use the expedited option, DHS is to review the plan to determine if it is facially deficient, pursuant to the reporting requirements of the CFATS Act of 2014. If DHS approves the EAP site security plan, it is to subsequently conduct a compliance inspection. In 2017, we found that DHS had implemented the EAP and had reported to Congress on the program, as required by the CFATS Act of 2014. In addition, as of June 2018 according to DHS officials, only 18 of the 3,152 facilities eligible to use the EAP opted to use it. DHS officials we interviewed attributed the low participation to several possible factors including: DHS had implemented the expedited program after most eligible facilities already submitted standard (non-expedited) security plans to DHS; facilities may consider the expedited program’s security measures to be too strict and prescriptive, not providing facilities the flexibility of the standard process; and the lack of an authorization inspection may discourage some facilities from using the expedited program because this inspection provides useful information about a facility’s security. We also found in 2017 that recent changes made to the CFATS program could affect the future use of the expedited program. As discussed previously, DHS has revised its methodology for determining the level of each facility’s security risk, which could affect a facility’s eligibility to participate in the EAP. DHS continues to apply the revised methodology to facilities regulated under the CFATS program and but it is too early to assess the impact on participation in the EAP. In our July 2015 report, we found that DHS began conducting compliance inspections in September 2013, and by April 2015, had conducted inspections of 83 of the 1,727 facilities that had approved security plans. Our analysis showed that nearly half of the facilities were not fully compliant with their approved site security plans and that DHS had not used its authority to issue penalties because DHS officials found it more productive to work with facilities to bring them in compliance. We also found that DHS did not have documented processes and procedures for managing the compliance of facilities that had not implemented planned measures by the deadlines outlined in the plans. We recommended that DHS document processes and procedures for managing compliance to provide more reasonable assurance that facilities implement planned measures and address security gaps. DHS agreed and has taken steps toward implementing this recommendation. DHS updated its CFATS Enforcement Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and has made progress on the new CFATS Inspections SOP. Once completed these two documents collectively are expected to formally document the processes and procedures currently being used to track noncompliant facilities and ensure they implement planned measures as outlined in their approved site security plans, according to ISCD officials. DHS officials stated they expect to finalize these procedures by the end of fiscal year 2018. We are examining compliance inspections as part of our ongoing work and will report on the results of our work in our report later this summer. In April 2013, we reported that DHS took various actions to work with facility owners and operators, including increasing the number of visits to facilities to discuss enhancing security plans, but that some trade associations had mixed views on the effectiveness of DHS’s outreach. We found that DHS solicited informal feedback from facility owners and operators in its efforts to communicate and work with them, but did not have an approach for obtaining systematic feedback on its outreach activities. We recommended that DHS take action to solicit and document feedback on facility outreach consistent with DHS efforts to develop a strategic communication plan. DHS agreed and implemented this recommendation by developing a questionnaire to solicit feedback on outreach with industry stakeholders and began using the questionnaire in October 2016.

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "length": 2993, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d0f4bf28d9fae91a2281f6f06b61ffa7fcaee2880f451c77"}
{"input": "", "context": "According to NRC’s website, the higher the radiation dose, the sooner the effects of radiation will appear, and the higher the probability of death. Radiation doses such as those received by survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan can cause cancers such as leukemia and colon cancer and, if levels are high enough, acute radiation syndrome. The symptoms of this syndrome range from nausea, fatigue, and vomiting to death within days or weeks. In contrast, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect. In particular, below about 100 millisieverts (mSv) (10 rem)—the level below which the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (National Academies) 2006 report on radiation and human health considered radiation to be low dose—data do not definitively establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation exposure. In developing and applying radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public—specifically, limits on dose or increased health risk and guidance levels on exposure—EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory bodies. In particular, they have relied on the advice of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies’ Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. This advice includes the use of the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. For example, the National Academies published a report in 2006 stating that the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk. According to the National Academies, the availability of new and more extensive data since the publication of its previous report in 1990 strengthened confidence in the 2006 report’s estimates of cancer risk. The advisory bodies have recognized challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure when using the linear no-threshold model. For example, much of the data on health effects of radiation exposure come from non-U.S. populations, such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors. These individuals received a large exposure to radiation over a short period of time (an acute exposure), and there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for these populations can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that is regularly (chronically) exposed to low-dose radiation. Nevertheless, NRC officials told us that, in the absence of convincing evidence that there is a dose threshold below which low levels of radiation are beneficial or not harmful, NRC will continue to follow the recommendations of scientific advisory bodies to use the linear no- threshold model. Similarly, officials from EPA told us that they would consider changing the use of the linear no-threshold model as the basis of their requirements and guidance only if there were a strong recommendation from scientific advisory bodies on radiation protection as well as an endorsement of the change by the National Academies. Under this model, federal regulations set dose limits for radiation exposure that are below the level in the National Academies’ 2006 report on radiation and human health for defining low-dose radiation. For example, NRC’s annual dose limit for members of the public (excluding natural, or background, sources of radiation) from operation of nuclear power plants is a hundredth of the level the National Academies considers low dose. NRC based the dose limit on an advisory body recommendation that the cancer risk to the general public from exposure to radiation should be comparable to the public’s risk from everyday activities, such as taking public transportation. The low-dose radiation limits and guidance that federal agencies have developed and applied vary depending on the settings in which exposure can occur. For example, NRC has established limits on occupational dose that apply to nuclear power-plant workers; these limits are higher than NRC’s annual dose limit for members of the public but are still below the level the National Academies considers low dose. In keeping with advisory body recommendations, NRC also applies the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). NRC defines ALARA to mean making every reasonable effort to maintain exposures to radiation as far below dose limits as is practical. At a nuclear power plant we visited as part of our work, representatives told us that under their ALARA plan, the plant set its own dose limit for workers at 40 percent of the NRC’s regulatory limit. Moreover, officials at the plant told us that they have been able to keep exposures below the plant’s own limit by continuously seeking opportunities to reduce unnecessary worker exposure to radiation, such as using robots to perform maintenance work in radiation areas. In contrast to radiation exposure received from nuclear power plants, FDA officials stated that the agency regulates the maximum radiation output of medical equipment, instead of setting limits on the total amount of radiation exposure to patients. According to FDA officials, FDA does not generally have the authority to regulate the total amount of radiation exposure a patient receives from medical imaging equipment. However, in keeping with the principle that radiation exposure should be kept as low as reasonably achievable, FDA encourages voluntary measures by health care providers, such as to investigate and determine whether it is possible to reduce radiation exposure to patients from the use of medical- imaging equipment. From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, seven federal agencies obligated $209.6 million for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. DOE and NIH accounted for most of the funding, with DOE obligating $116.3 million and NIH obligating $88.6 million, or about 56 percent and 42 percent of the total, respectively. The five other agencies—NRC, NASA, DOD, EPA, and CDC—obligated the remaining $4.7 million, or about 2 percent of the total. DOE has two offices that have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation—the Office of Science and the Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security—according to funding information DOE provided. The Office of Science established the Low Dose Radiation Research Program in 1998 and funded it through fiscal year 2016. A primary focus of this program was radiobiological research, which examines molecular and cellular responses to radiation exposure. According to DOE’s website for the program, the program provided data and information about the low-dose range of exposure, producing 737 peer-reviewed publications as of March 2012. The Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security provided funding for epidemiological studies, including studies involving Japanese atomic bomb survivors. NIH has funded and conducted both epidemiological and radiobiological studies on low-dose radiation, according to NIH officials. The officials stated that the studies are conducted through the National Cancer Institute’s internal research program for radiation epidemiology, as well as through NIH’s research programs for external funding of investigator- initiated research. Other institutes of NIH, including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, also fund research related to the health effects of radiation exposure as part of NIH’s overall mission to fund medical research. Among the other agencies that provided some funding to low-dose radiation studies, several provided funding to the Epidemiological Study of One Million U.S. Radiation Workers and Veterans (Million Person Study)—an ongoing study headed by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. DOE also provided funding for this study. In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the seven agencies who provided funding for research on health effects of low-dose radiation collectively decreased their annual funding obligations in this area by 48 percent, from $57.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to $30.4 million in fiscal year 2016. DOE accounted for a large portion of this overall decrease in annual funding. Specifically, over this 5-year period, DOE reduced its annual funding obligations for this area of research by 45 percent—from $32.6 million in fiscal year 2012 to $18.0 million in fiscal year 2016. According to DOE, the decrease was primarily due to DOE’s reduction in funding for its Low Dose Radiation Research Program. According to DOE officials, decreases in funding for the program reflected a shift toward bioenergy and environmental research. Similarly, over the 5-year period, NIH’s funding for low-dose radiation research decreased by 48 percent—from $23.1 million in fiscal year 2012 to $12.0 million in fiscal year 2016. NIH officials explained that funding levels for a particular disease or research area can fluctuate depending on several factors, including the number and quality of research proposals submitted and the outcome of NIH’s peer reviews of the proposals, as well as the overall research budget. The seven agencies that funded research on health effects of low-dose radiation for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 collaborated on particular research projects through various mechanisms, including joint funding of individual projects, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities. As previously noted, the 2016 report of DOE’s Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee provided information about research needs in low-dose radiation and found that further research could decrease uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation. The report stated that other agencies—including NRC, NIH, EPA, DOD, and NASA—could benefit from the reduction in uncertainty that could be obtained by this research. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. We made this recommendation because our previous work has shown that collaborative mechanisms can serve multiple purposes, such as leading interagency efforts to develop and coordinate sound science and technology policies across the federal government. Although collaborative mechanisms differ in complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain key features, such as leadership. We directed this recommendation to DOE for several reasons. In the past, DOE took a leading role in advocating for greater communication and coordination between the fields of radiation biology and epidemiology. In addition, DOE is the federal agency that currently has primary responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for research related to the protection of health during activities that can result in exposure to radiation. DOE is well positioned to lead an effort to ensure that federal agencies have a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address overall research priorities related to low-dose radiation health effects because of the agency’s past experience as a leader in this area of research. Such an effort could help DOE and the collaborating agencies determine roles and responsibilities, including leadership when addressing shared research priorities. DOE did not agree with our recommendation. In particular, DOE stated that EPA and NRC also have legal mandates to research low-dose radiation exposure and that these agencies establish their research priorities in accordance with their respective budget authorities and recommendations from independent advisory bodies. DOE stated that as a result, it would not be appropriate for DOE to lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration. We believe that DOE’s concerns stem from a misinterpretation of our recommendation, and we made several changes to our report and our recommendation to clarify DOE’s role. We noted that we did not recommend that a mechanism for interagency collaboration serve as a replacement for agencies’ legal mandates, budget authorities, and recommendations from independent advisory bodies. Instead, this mechanism would help agencies address shared research priorities. In making our recommendation, we did not specify the coordinating mechanism that agencies should use and instead left it to DOE to lead the development of an appropriate mechanism. We continue to believe that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"input": "", "context": "Our October 2017 report found that CMS provided guidance to Medicare Part D plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization problems among Part D beneficiaries. The agency included this guidance in its annual letters to plan sponsors, known as call letters; it also provided a supplemental memo to plan sponsors in 2012. Among other things, these guidance documents instructed plan sponsors to implement a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system to monitor beneficiary utilization starting in 2013. As part of the DUR systems, CMS required plan sponsors to have methods to identify beneficiaries who were potentially overusing specific drugs or groups of drugs, including opioids. Also in 2013, CMS created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS), which outlined criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids, and to oversee sponsors’ compliance with CMS’s opioid overutilization policy. Plan sponsors may use the OMS criteria for their DUR systems, but they had some flexibility to develop their own targeting criteria within CMS guidance. At the time of our review, the OMS considered beneficiaries to be at a high risk of opioid overuse when they met all three of the following criteria: 1. received a total daily MED greater than 120 mg for 90 consecutive 2. received opioid prescriptions from four or more health care providers in the previous 12 months, and 3. received opioids from four or more pharmacies in the previous 12 months. The criteria excluded beneficiaries with a cancer diagnosis and those in hospice care, for whom higher doses of opioids may be appropriate. We found that through the OMS, CMS generated quarterly reports that list beneficiaries who met all of the criteria and who were identified as high- risk, and then distributed the reports to the plan sponsors. Plan sponsors were expected to review the list of identified beneficiaries, determine appropriate action, and then respond to CMS with information on their actions within 30 days. According to CMS officials, the agency also expected plan sponsors to share any information with CMS on beneficiaries that they identified through their own DUR systems. We found that some actions plan sponsors may take included the following: Case management. Case management may include an attempt to improve coordination issues, and often involves provider outreach, whereby the plan sponsor will contact the providers associated with the beneficiary to let them know that the beneficiary is receiving high levels of opioids and may be at risk of harm. Beneficiary-specific point-of-sale (POS) edits. Beneficiary-specific POS edits are restrictions that limit these beneficiaries to certain opioids and amounts. Pharmacists receive a message when a beneficiary attempts to fill a prescription that exceeds the limit in place for that beneficiary. Formulary-level POS edits. These edits alert providers who may not have been aware that their patients are receiving high levels of opioids from other doctors. Referrals for investigation. According to the six plan sponsors we interviewed, the referrals can be made to CMS’s National Benefit Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (NBI MEDIC), which was responsible for identifying and investigating potential Part D fraud, waste, and abuse, or to the plan sponsor’s own internal investigative unit, if they have one. After investigating a particular case, they may refer the case to the HHS-OIG or a law enforcement agency, according to CMS, NBI MEDIC, and one plan sponsor. Based on CMS’s use of the OMS and the actions taken by plan sponsors, CMS reported a 61 percent decrease from calendar years 2011 through 2016 in the number of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria of high risk—from 29,404 to 11,594 beneficiaries—which agency officials considered an indication of success toward its goal of decreasing opioid use disorder. In addition, we found that CMS relied on separate patient safety measures developed and maintained by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance to assess how well Part D plan sponsors were monitoring beneficiaries and taking appropriate actions. In 2016, CMS started tracking plan sponsors’ performance on three patient safety measures that were directly related to opioids. The three measures were similar to the OMS criteria in that they identified beneficiaries with high dosages of opioids (120 mg MED), beneficiaries that use opioids from multiple providers and pharmacies, and beneficiaries that do both. However, one difference between these approaches was that the patient safety measures separately identified beneficiaries who fulfill each criterion individually. Our October 2017 report also found that CMS tracked the total number of beneficiaries who met all three OMS criteria as part of its opioid overutilization oversight across the Part D program. However, the agency did not have comparable information on most beneficiaries who receive high doses of opioids—regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies used—and who therefore may be at risk for harm, according to CDC’s 2016 guidelines. These guidelines noted that long-term use of high doses of opioids—those above a MED of 90 mg per day—are associated with significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible. Based on the CDC guidelines, outreach to Part D plan sponsors, and CMS analyses of Part D data, CMS has revised its current OMS criteria to include more at-risk beneficiaries beginning in 2018. The new OMS criteria define a high user as an individual having an average daily MED greater than 90 mg for any duration; receiving opioids from four or more providers and four or more pharmacies, or from six or more providers regardless of the number of pharmacies, for the prior 6 months. Based on 2015 data, CMS found that 33,223 beneficiaries would have met these revised criteria. While the revised criteria would help identify beneficiaries who CMS determined are at the highest risk of opioid misuse and therefore may need case management by plan sponsors, they did not provide information on the total number of Part D beneficiaries who may be at risk of harm. In developing the revised criteria, CMS conducted a one-time analysis that estimated there were 727,016 beneficiaries with an average MED of 90 mg or more, for any length of time during a 6 month measurement period in 2015, regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies used. According to the CDC guidelines, these beneficiaries may be at risk of harm from opioids, and therefore tracking the total number of these beneficiaries over time could help CMS to determine whether it is making progress toward meeting the goals specified in its Opioid Misuse Strategy to reduce the risk of opioid use disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and drug diversion. However, CMS officials told us that the agency did not keep track of the total number of these beneficiaries, and did not have plans to do so as part of OMS. (See fig. 1.) We also found that in 2016, CMS began to gather information from its patient safety measures on the number of beneficiaries who use more than 120 mg MED of opioids for 90 days or longer, regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies. The patient safety measures identified 285,119 such beneficiaries—counted as member-years—in 2016. However, this information did not include all at-risk beneficiaries, because the threshold was more lenient than indicated in CDC guidelines and CMS’s new OMS criteria. Because neither the OMS criteria nor the patient safety measures included all beneficiaries potentially at risk of harm from high opioid doses, we recommended that CMS should gather information over time on the total number of beneficiaries who receive high opioid morphine equivalent doses regardless of the number of pharmacies or providers, as part of assessing progress over time in reaching the agency’s goals related to reducing opioid use. HHS concurred with our recommendation. Our October 2017 report found that CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor, NBI MEDIC, and the Part D plan sponsors. NBI MEDIC’s data analyses to identify outlier providers. CMS required NBI MEDIC to identify providers who prescribe high amounts of Schedule II drugs, which include but are not limited to opioids. Using prescription drug data, NBI MEDIC conducted a peer comparison of providers’ prescribing practices to identify outlier providers—the highest prescribers of Schedule II drugs—and reported the results to CMS. NBI MEDIC’s other projects. NBI MEDIC gathered and analyzed data on Medicare Part C and Part D, including projects using the Predictive Learning Analytics Tracking Outcome (PLATO) system. According to NBI MEDIC officials, these PLATO projects sought to identify potential fraud by examining data on provider behaviors. NBI MEDIC’s investigations to identify fraud, waste, and abuse. NBI MEDIC officials conducted investigations to assist CMS in identifying cases of potential fraud, waste, and abuse among providers for Medicare Part C and Part D. The investigations were prompted by complaints from plan sponsors; suspected fraud, waste, or abuse reported to NBI MEDIC’s call center; NBI MEDIC’s analysis of outlier providers; or from one of its other data analysis projects. NBI MEDIC’s referrals. After identifying providers engaged in potential fraudulent overprescribing, NBI MEDIC officials said they may refer cases to law enforcement agencies or the HHS-OIG for further investigation and potential prosecution. Plan sponsors’ monitoring of providers. CMS required all plan sponsors to adopt and implement an effective compliance program, which must include measures to prevent, detect, and correct Part C or Part D program noncompliance, as well as fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS’s guidance focused broadly on prescription drugs, and did not specifically address opioids. Our report concluded that although these efforts provided valuable information, CMS lacked information necessary to adequately oversee opioid prescribing. CMS’s oversight actions focused broadly on Schedule II drugs rather than specifically on opioids. For example, NBI MEDIC’s analyses to identify outlier providers did not indicate the extent to which they may be overprescribing opioids specifically. According to CMS officials, they directed NBI MEDIC to focus on Schedule II drugs, because these drugs have a high potential for abuse, whether they are opioids or other drugs. However, without specifically identifying opioids in these analyses—or an alternate source of data—CMS lacked data on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and therefore cannot assess progress toward meeting its goals related to reducing opioid use, which would be consistent with federal internal control standards. Federal internal control standards require agencies to conduct monitoring activities and to use quality information to achieve objectives and address risks. As a result, we recommended that CMS require NBI MEDIC to gather separate data on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids. This would allow CMS to better identify those providers who are inappropriately and potentially fraudulently overprescribing opioids. HHS agreed, and in April 2018 reported that it is working with NBI MEDIC to separately identify outlier prescribers of opioids. In addition, our 2017 report found that CMS also lacked key information necessary for oversight of opioid prescribing, because it did not require plan sponsors to report to NBI MEDIC or CMS cases of fraud, waste, and abuse; cases of overprescribing; or any actions taken against providers. Plan sponsors collected information on cases of fraud, waste, and abuse, and could choose to report this information to NBI MEDIC or CMS. While CMS receives information from plan sponsors who voluntarily reported their actions, it did not know the full extent to which plan sponsors had identified providers who prescribed high amounts of opioids, or the full extent to which sponsors had taken action to reduce overprescribing. We concluded that without this information, it was difficult for CMS to assess progress in this area, which would be consistent with federal internal control standards. In our report, we recommended that CMS require plan sponsors to report on investigations and other actions taken related to providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids. HHS did not concur with this recommendation. HHS noted that plan sponsors have the responsibility to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, and that CMS reviews cases when it conducts audits. HHS also stated that it seeks to balance requirements on plan sponsors when considering new regulatory requirements. However, without complete reporting—such as reporting from all plan sponsors on the actions they take to reduce overprescribing—we believe that CMS is missing key information that could help assess progress in this area. Due to the importance of this information for achieving the agency’s goals, we continue to believe that CMS should require plan sponsors to report on the actions they take to reduce overprescribing. In conclusion, a large number of Medicare Part D beneficiaries use potentially harmful levels of prescription opioids, and reducing the inappropriate prescribing of these drugs has been a key part of CMS’s strategy to decrease the risk of opioid use disorder, overdoses, and deaths. Despite working to identify and decrease egregious opioid use behavior—such as doctor shopping—among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, CMS lacked the necessary information to effectively determine the full number of beneficiaries at risk of harm, as well as other information that could help CMS assess whether its efforts to reduce opioid overprescribing are effective. It is important that health care providers help patients to receive appropriate pain treatment, including opioids, based on the consideration of benefits and risks. Access to information on the risks that Medicare patients face from inappropriate or poorly monitored prescriptions, as well as information on providers who may be inappropriately prescribing opioids, could help CMS as it works to improve care.

Medicare and Medicaid, two of the nation's largest health care programs, provide prescription drug coverage that can include opioids. GAO and others have reported on inappropriate activities and risks associated with these prescriptions. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report (GAO-18-15) and discusses (1) CMS oversight of Medicare beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions under Part D, and (2) CMS oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. For the October 2017 report, GAO reviewed CMS opioid utilization and prescriber data, CMS guidance for plan sponsors, and CMS's strategy to prevent opioid misuse. GAO also interviewed CMS officials, the six largest Part D plan sponsors, and 12 national associations selected to represent insurance plans, pharmacy benefit managers, physicians, patients, and regulatory and law enforcement authorities. In October 2017, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provided guidance on the monitoring of Medicare beneficiaries who received opioid prescriptions to plan sponsors—private organizations that implement the Medicare drug benefit, Part D—but it lacked information on most beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioid use. Specifically, GAO found that CMS provided guidance to plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and required them to implement drug utilization review systems that use criteria similar to CMS's. Prior to 2018, the agency's criteria focused on beneficiaries who did all the following: (1) received prescriptions of high doses of opioids, (2) received prescriptions from four or more providers, and (3) filled prescriptions at four or more pharmacies. According to CMS, this approach focused actions on beneficiaries the agency determined to have the highest risk of harm. For 2018, CMS revised the criteria to include more at-risk beneficiaries. CMS's criteria, including recent revisions, did not provide sufficient information about the larger population of potentially at-risk beneficiaries. CMS estimated that, in 2015, 727,016 beneficiaries would have received high doses of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies, but only 33,223 would have met its revised criteria. In 2016, CMS began to collect information on some of these beneficiaries using a higher dosage threshold for opioid use. However, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, CMS's approach also missed some who could be at risk of harm. As a result, CMS had limited information to assess progress against the goals of the Medicare and Medicaid programs' Opioid Misuse Strategy, which includes activities to reduce risk of harm to beneficiaries. CMS provided oversight on prescribing of drugs at high risk of abuse through a variety of projects, but did not analyze data specifically on opioids. According to CMS officials, CMS and plan sponsors identified providers who prescribed large amounts of drugs with a high risk of abuse, and those suspected of fraud or abuse may be referred to law enforcement. However, GAO found that CMS did not identify providers who may be inappropriately prescribing large amounts of opioids separately from other drugs, and did not require plan sponsors to report actions they take when they identified such providers. As a result, CMS lacked information that it could use to assess how opioid prescribing patterns are changing over time, and whether its efforts to reduce harm are effective. In the October 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations that CMS (1) gather information on the full number of at-risk beneficiaries receiving high doses of opioids, (2) identify providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and (3) require plan sponsors to report to CMS on actions related to providers who inappropriately prescribe opioids. HHS concurred with the first two recommendations, but not with the third. GAO continues to believe the recommendation is valid, as discussed in the report and in this statement."], "length": 2998, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "71c9c954fd82ec75215de34d755dbea67bd0c78388d8caef"}
{"input": "", "context": "The Military Selective Service Act established the Selective Service System whose mission is to be prepared to provide trained and untrained manpower to DOD in the event of a national emergency when directed by the President and the Congress. Additionally, the Selective Service System is to be prepared to implement an alternative service program within the civilian community for registrants classified as conscientious objectors during a draft. The Selective Service System is an independent agency, and it maintains a database that includes the names, birthdates, social security numbers, and mailing addresses of men ages 18 through 25 who could be drafted into the service of our nation, if needed, in the event of a national emergency. Further, the Selective Service System also is to conduct peacetime activities, such as public registration awareness and outreach; responding to public inquiries about registration requirements; and providing training and support to its workforce of career, non-career, full-time and part-time employees, uncompensated employees, and selected military personnel. The Military Selective Service Act does not currently authorize the use of a draft for the induction of persons into the armed forces. In order to meet a national emergency requiring a mass mobilization, Congress and the President would be required to enact a law authorizing a draft to supplement the existing force with additional military manpower. In the event of a draft, the regulation governing the Military Entrance Processing Stations would have the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, with input from the military services, provide the Director of the Selective Service System with the number of personnel needed to be drafted. The Selective Service System would then conduct a lottery and send induction notices to selected draftees to supply the personnel requested by the Secretary of Defense. Each draftee would be required to report to one of DOD’s 65 Military Entrance Processing Stations throughout the country at a specific time and date to undergo assessments of their aptitude, character, and medical qualifications in order to determine whether they are fit for military service based on standards set by each military service. Fully qualified draftees would receive induction orders and would be transported from one of the Military Entrance Processing Stations to the appropriate military service’s entry- level training location. According to DOD, the Selective Service System must deliver the first inductees within 193 days from when the President and the Congress authorize a draft, and the military services then are to train, equip, and accommodate in other ways the new inductees. The military services are generally smaller today than they have been in many years. In fiscal year 2003, for example, DOD’s total active military end strength was approximately 1.5 million, while in fiscal year 2017 the number was 1.38 million. Additionally, DOD’s total workforce mix has also changed. For example, in late 2003 DOD directed the military services to convert certain military positions to federal civilian or contract positions based on evaluations that showed that many military personnel were being used to accomplish work that was not military essential and that civilians could often perform these tasks in a more efficient and cost- effective manner than military personnel. In May 2013, we reported that DOD officials stated that about 50,000 military positions were converted to DOD federal civilian positions or to contractors since fiscal year 2004 in order to devote more military positions to the support of ongoing military operations. Under current law, women may serve voluntarily in the armed forces but are not required to register with the Selective Service System. In the 1981 case of Rostker v. Goldberg, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of our nation’s practice of registering only men. Recognizing the purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops and since women were excluded from combat, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could exclude women from registration. DOD gradually began to eliminate prohibitions on the assignment of women to direct ground combat positions and on January 24, 2013, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff rescinded a 1994 rule preventing women from serving in direct ground-combat positions and directed the military services to open all closed positions and occupations to women by January 1, 2016. In December 2015, the Secretary of Defense announced that all military occupational specialties were open to women and removed all final restrictions on the service of women in combat. As part of the congressional notification process when DOD decided to open previously- closed positions and occupations to women, the department was required to provide a detailed legal analysis of the implications of the proposed change with respect to the constitutionality of the Military Selective Service Act to men only. DOD’s July 2017 report on the purpose and utility of a registration system for military selective service stated that in December 2015, DOD advised Congress that the opening of all positions and occupations to women “further alters the factual backdrop” to the Supreme Court’s ruling on a challenge to the exemption of women from selective service registration. However, the report stated that DOD took no further stance on the legal issues raised by the then-Secretary of Defense’s decision to open all military positions to women. Further, DOD stated that it would consult with the Department of Justice as appropriate regarding these issues. DOD included information on each of the six required reporting elements in its July 2017 report to Congress and the Commission on the purpose and utility of a registration system for military selective service, as shown in table 1. In preparing the report, officials within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated that they coordinated and consulted with subject matter experts at the Selective Service System and the Joint Staff as well as with officials from selected organizations within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, including the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command. Further, the DOD report references internal DOD documents, a policy publication from the Congressional Research Service regarding Selective Service issues, statements from former DOD executives, and publications from contributing authors on web-based foreign policy and national security discussion sites for additional support. While DOD included information on the six required reporting elements in its report, we identified additional information that may be useful in supporting the ongoing review of the military selective service process by the Commission. Specifically, based on our review of DOD’s report and our prior work, the Commission could benefit from additional information on (1) DOD’s requirements and timelines for the induction of individuals into the military services who are selected through a draft, and (2) the perspectives of the military services on the military selective service processes. First, one of the six required reporting elements in the NDAA for FY 2017 required DOD to provide a detailed analysis of its personnel needs in the event of an emergency requiring a mass mobilization, along with a timeline for obtaining these inductees. In response, DOD provided the personnel requirements and a timeline that was developed in 1994 and that have not been updated since. These requirements state that, in the event of a draft, the first inductees are to report to a Military Entrance Processing Station in 193 days and the first 100,000 inductees would report for service in 210 days. DOD’s report states that the all-volunteer force is of adequate size and composition to meet DOD’s personnel needs and it has no operational plans that envision mobilization at a level that would require a draft. Officials stated that the personnel requirements and timeline developed in 1994 are still considered realistic. Thus, they did not conduct any additional analysis to update the plans, personnel requirements, or timelines for responding to an emergency requiring mass mobilization. Further, they said that they were limited in the amount of time that they were given to respond to the congressional mandate and that they believed it would be most helpful to produce a report that provided basic information that could serve as a starting point for the Commission to begin a more in-depth review of the military selective service process. As previously discussed, in 2012, we reported that changes in the national security environment require DOD and the services to reassess their force structure requirements, including how many and what types of units are necessary to carry out the national defense strategy. We reported that these changes represented junctures at which DOD could systematically reevaluate service personnel levels to determine whether they are consistent with strategic objectives. As such, we recommended that DOD establish a process of periodically reevaluating DOD’s requirements for the Selective Service System in light of changing operating environments, threats, and strategic guidance. Since DOD did not perform additional analysis to reevaluate its requirements or timelines for obtaining inductees to respond to this mandate and the most recent requirements were determined based on assumptions developed in 1994, we continue to believe our 2012 recommendation is valid. An updated analysis would also benefit the Commission by informing their study and recommendations. Second, the military service officials that we met with told us that their perspectives on the selective service processes that would affect them had not been solicited in the preparation of DOD’s report. For example, while the military services are responsible for training inductees upon their mobilization and integrating them into the force, service officials expressed concerns to us regarding whether, for example, they would have the training facilities, uniforms or funding to receive, train, equip, and integrate a large influx of inductees in the event of a draft. Additionally, the services are expected to provide support to the Selective Service System during a national emergency. A 1997 memorandum of understanding between the Selective Service System and DOD indicates, among other things, that the Department of the Army will provide 1,500 enlisted Army retirees to augment the Selective Service System within 72 hours after a draft is initiated. According to officials within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness-Military Personnel Policy, this memorandum of understanding was reviewed and revalidated in 2014. However, Army officials told us that they believed some of their service-specific procedures might require updates identifying individuals to augment the Selective Service System’s staff, especially the retired personnel that would need to be recalled to duty. They thought it would be beneficial for officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to conduct a thorough, top-down review, and lead an update of service instructions related to supporting a draft to ensure the services are prepared to provide their share of personnel if needed. These Army officials said, however, that their higher Army headquarters saw no operational reason to review their policies and procedures related to mass mobilization given that DOD has no operational plans that envision mobilization at a level that would require a draft. As discussed previously in this report, DOD’s workforce mix has been changing. For example, over the last decade, the use of unmanned aerial systems has emerged as an integral part of warfighting operations and the demand for their use has outpaced the Air Force’s ability to produce pilots to operate them. Additionally, each of the services has reported critical skill gaps in such areas as various military medical specialties. Further, challenges exist in identifying cyber capabilities of all National Guard units, as required by law, which could be used for the support of a cyber-related emergency. Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness-Military Personnel Policy stated that critical skills identified as necessary today may not be the critical skills needed in future crises. Additionally, they said that creating and maintaining tools, such as databases of individuals with these needed critical skills, is costly and may become outdated quickly. We agree that the requirements for critical skills will evolve over time; however, any discussion of a draft using the selective service process— as presented in DOD’s July 2017 report—that focuses on specific military occupational specialties would benefit from the perspectives and input of officials from the military services and the impact a draft may have on meeting those demands. Specifically, these officials would be helpful in identifying the needed critical skill sets for their emerging mission demands and the impact a draft may have on meeting those demands. DOD officials within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated that they are currently collecting the perspectives of the military services on the selective service process and plan to provide this information to the Commission. DOD officials explained that they did not incorporate information from the military services into their report because DOD’s involvement in any potential decision to initiate and implement a draft is mostly centralized within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, not within the individual military services. They further stated that information regarding the level of additional personnel that would be needed using a draft in the event of a national emergency comes from the war plans that are developed and maintained by the Joint Staff. Additionally, they said that they primarily produced a report that characterized the overall processes and was a factual account of how DOD interacts with various aspects of the Selective Service System. Another provision within the NDAA for FY 2017 required the Secretary of Defense and other Cabinet-level government officials, along with any experts designated by the President, to submit to the Commission and Congress recommendations for the reform of the military selective service process not later than 7 months after the Commission’s establishment date. To accomplish this, officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs said that they initially developed a questionnaire on which the Commission provided feedback. These officials stated that they sent it to 18 organizations, including the Cabinet positions listed in the act and to additional organizations that were recommended by the National Security Council or that had some role or responsibility in the event of a draft. In order to produce the Secretary of Defense’s submission, these officials further stated that they requested each of the military services and the Joint Staff to complete the questionnaire by November 2017. Further, these officials viewed the questionnaire as an opportunity for the respondents—the military services in the case of DOD—to provide their ideas regarding military selective service processes, both current and future. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In an email, the Director of Accession Policy within the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy stated that the military services concurred with the report and DOD had no additional comments. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service; the Secretary of Defense; the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs; the Commander, U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command; the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director, Selective Service System.

In the NDAA for FY 2017, Congress included a provision requiring that DOD submit a report on the current and future need for a centralized registration system under the Military Selective Service Act. In addition, the act established a Commission to review, among other things, the military selective service process and report on it. The act also included a provision for GAO to review DOD's procedures for evaluating selective service requirements. In this report, GAO compared the information DOD included in its report with the act's required elements and identified additional information that could benefit the Commission as it further reviews the military selective service process. GAO reviewed DOD's report and the statutory elements and interviewed officials involved in the military selective service process to identify additional information that could benefit the Commission's ongoing review. In its July 2017 report to Congress and the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service (i.e., “the Commission”), the Department of Defense (DOD) provided information regarding each of the six required reporting elements contained in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. Specifically, DOD provided information on: 1. the direct and indirect benefits of the military selective service system; 2. the functions performed by the Selective Service System that would be assumed by DOD in the absence of a national registration system; 3. the systems, manpower, and facilities needed by DOD to physically mobilize inductees in the absence of the Selective Service System; 4. the feasibility and the utility of eliminating the focus on the mass mobilization of primarily combat troops in favor of a system that focuses on the mobilization of military occupational specialties, and the extent to which such a change would impact the need for both male and female inductees; 5. DOD's personnel needs in the event of an emergency requiring mass mobilization; an analysis of any additional critical skills that would be needed in the event of a national emergency; and a timeline for when DOD would require the first inductees to report for service; and 6. a list of the assumptions used by DOD to conduct its analysis. GAO identified additional information that may benefit the Commission's ongoing evaluation of the military selective service process. The fifth required reporting element required DOD to analyze its personnel needs in the event of an emergency requiring mass mobilization and a timeline for obtaining these inductees. In response, DOD provided the personnel requirements and timeline that were developed in 1994 and that have not been updated since. DOD officials stated that they did not conduct additional analysis to update these requirements because the all-volunteer force is of adequate size and composition to meet DOD's personnel needs. In 2012, GAO recommended that DOD establish a process to periodically reevaluate DOD's requirements for the Selective Service System. Although DOD concurred with this recommendation, it has not yet implemented it. GAO believes this recommendation is still valid. Having updated DOD Selective Service System requirements and timelines for a potential draft may be useful in supporting the ongoing evaluation of the military selective service process by the Commission. Further, military service officials told GAO that their perspectives on how selective service processes that could affect them had not been solicited in the preparation of DOD's report. Since the military services are to receive, train and integrate the inductees; provide support to the Selective Service System during a national emergency; and could help identify critical skill sets needed to meet emerging demands and the impact a draft could have on meeting those demands, the military service officials' perspectives could be useful to the Commission. DOD officials stated that they are currently collecting these perspectives and plan to provide this information to the Commission. GAO is not making any new recommendations. GAO believes its 2012 recommendation to DOD to periodically reevaluate its requirements for the Selective Service System, which DOD concurred with, is still valid. DOD had no additional comments on this report."], "length": 3325, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fb97d33ec1b899ebdf723a1b853c450327052d219847fb26"}
{"input": "", "context": "In FY2019 and FY2020, more than 90% of federal highway assistance is being distributed to the states by formula. Highway funding formulas have been in use to apportion federal highway authorizations among the states since the passage of the first federal-aid highway act more than a century ago. The resulting apportionments are widely used to evaluate how individual states benefit from federal highway assistance relative to other states. Although the procedure currently used to distribute federal highway funds is written into law and programs receiving funds in this manner are frequently referred to as \"formula programs,\" the statutory language does not describe any formula in a straightforward way. In consequence, it can be difficult to understand how the apportionment of funds is determined, and whether that apportionment adequately reflects considerations that may be of concern to Members of Congress. This report describes the origins and development of highway formula funding, and then discusses how the use of various formula factors gave way to the current apportionment mechanism. A series of tables compares individual states' shares of the FY2018 apportionment with their shares of some factors relevant to highway needs. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 355), which created the first ongoing federal program to fund road construction, used three factors to apportion federal highway funds among the states. After setting some funds aside to cover administrative costs, the law apportioned the remaining authorization to the states according to three factors. These factors were selected, in part, because they were not difficult to compile and seemed relevant to individual states' costs to build and maintain a highway system. The three factors, which were weighted equally, were 1. land area: the ratio which the area of each state bore to the total area of all states; 2. population: the ratio which the population of each state bore to the total population of all the states, as shown by the latest available census; and 3. postal road mileage: the ratio which the mileage of rural free delivery routes and star routes in each state bore to the total mileage of such in all the states at the close of the preceding year. The selection of these factors had much to do with disagreement between urban and rural interests about the goals of the road program and with constitutional concerns regarding the appropriateness of federal spending on road construction. The population and land area factors were proxies for the rural and urban state interests. The population factor was seen as protecting the interests of the more densely populated eastern states and the land area factor as protecting the interests of large but less populated western states. The use of a postal road mileage factor helped allay any constitutional qualms, as Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution specifically grants Congress the power \"To establish…post roads,\" but the factor also garnered favor from less populous states. The 1916 act also set the maximum federal share of the cost of any highway project at 50%. The 1916 act supported the construction of rural roads and excluded streets and roads in places having a population of 2,500 or more. The formula factors enacted in 1916 remained in place, with only temporary changes made in Depression-era emergency legislation and war legislation, until passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 838). The 1944 act began to shift the federal highway program away from construction of rural roads. It created three separate highway systems: a Primary System, a Secondary System, and an Urban System. Each system was authorized a percentage of the total funds provided, which were then apportioned among the states by formula. The Federal Highway Act of 1921 (42 Stat 22) retained the three formula factors adopted in 1916, but increased federal control over the use of funds by requiring the designation of a system of highways, limited to 7% of each state's total highway mileage, on which the federal funds could be spent. The 1921 act also guaranteed that each state would receive at least one-half percent of the total appropriation in any year. With this law, the three main characteristics of today's federal highway program were in place: funds were apportioned to the states by formula and implementation was left primarily to state governments; the states were required to provide matching funds; and the funds could be spent only on designated federal-aid highways. The Primary System funds were apportioned using the three formula factors established in 1916: each state's share of the national land area, population, and rural post road mileage, with each factor weighted equally. Funds for the Secondary System were apportioned based on each state's share of the national land area, rural population, and rural postal route mileage. The Urban System formula apportioned funds to the states based on one formula factor: each state's share of the national population living in urban areas of 5,000 or more residents. Although the act still favored rural areas, it was the first significant programmatic shift away from what had been essentially a rural road program. During the 1970s and 1980s, as Congress created many narrowly targeted programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, it frequently adopted formula factors specific to those programs. By FY1977, there were 35 separate authorized programs. Of those, 13, including all the larger programs, apportioned funds by a variety of statutory formulas. Examples of programs receiving more narrowly targeted funding were the new highway safety and hazard elimination programs, for which funds were apportioned based on both total state population and public road mileage. With the aging of the Interstate Highway System, a new Interstate Resurfacing, Restoration, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Program (Interstate 4R) was created, with funding apportioned based on each state's Interstate Highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on the Interstate System, as shares of the respective national totals. A 1986 report from the General Accounting Office (GAO) criticized the use of land area, decennial population, and postal road mileage in the distribution of highway funding. It recommended instead the use of vehicle miles traveled (on and off the Interstate System), lane miles, motor fuel consumption, annualized population statistics, and road deterioration. Although the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA; P.L. 102-240 ) substantially reorganized the highway programs, it apportioned the funds of the four largest apportioned programs (accounting for roughly 70% of all apportioned funds) according to each state's share of apportionments during the FY1987-FY1991 period rather than according to specific factors. According to a 1995 GAO report, this procedure, to a significant extent, made \"the underlying data and factors… not meaningful because the funding outcome is largely predetermined.\" Under ISTEA, the apportionments from FY1992 through FY1998 were fixed for six years by the factors used in the FY1987-1991 apportionments. Significantly, they did not reflect the new 1990 census data. An exception was a new program, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), which was apportioned according to population in each state's air quality non-attainment areas relative to the national population living in non-attainment areas. In 1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178 ) reestablished apportionment formula factors for individual programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, often using new factors designed to act as proxies for the needs a program was intended to address. For example, the formula for the National Highway System program, one of several large programs, used four factors to apportion the annual authorization: 1. 25% based on the ratio of each state's lane miles on principal arterial routes (excluding the Interstate System) to the national total; 2. 35% based on the ratio of each state's vehicle miles traveled on principal arterial routes (excluding the Interstate System) to the national total; 3. 30% based on the ratio of each state's diesel fuel use on highways within each state to the national total; 4. 10% based on the ratio of each state's per capita lane miles of principal arterial highways to the national total. The Surface Transportation Program, the federal-aid program that the states had the greatest discretion in spending, was apportioned by a formula that used three weighted factors: 1. 25% based on the ratio of each state's total lane miles of federal-aid highways to the national total; 2. 40% based on the ratio of each state's vehicle miles on federal-aid highways to the national total; 3. 35% based on the ratio of each state's estimated tax payments attributable to highway users paid into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund—the source of federal funding for highways—to the national total. The last surface transportation reauthorization that used formula factors to apportion individual program authorizations was the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: a Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU; P.L. 109-59 ), enacted in 2005. That law apportioned 13 programs using funding formulas. For example, funds under the Highway Safety Improvement Program were apportioned according to three equally weighted factors: (1) each state's share of lane miles of federal-aid-highways; (2) vehicle miles traveled on federal-aid highways; and (3) number of fatalities on the federal-aid system. In contrast, the Railway-Highway Crossings Program used the share of public railway-highway crossings in each state. The factors of land area and postal route mileage were no longer used for distributing any highway funds. Population figures were used for only two of the 13 formula programs authorized in SAFETEA-LU. Between 1982 and 2005, the formulas embedded in surface transportation authorization acts were not always decisive in determining how funds were apportioned. After some states objected that their residents paid more of the motor fuel and truck taxes that flowed into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund than they received in federal highway funding, Congress enacted \"equity\" programs that generally did three things. First, each act included a guarantee that each state would receive federal funding at least equal to a specific percentage of the federal highway taxes its residents paid. Second, all or nearly all states were given an increase in funding from the equity program. Third, the program size was calculated in a way to assure that the states receiving less than their residents paid in highway taxes could be made whole up to their guaranteed percentage and most other states could get more funding as well. In the 1982 act, 5% of highway funding was distributed through the equity program, but in SAFETEA in 2005 the equity program received over 20% of the funds. The equity program distribution determined the total apportionment amount for each state and reduced the impact of the formula factors when it came to calculating each state's apportionments under the individual formula programs. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141 ), enacted in 2012, eliminated or consolidated two-thirds of the federal highway programs. It also made major changes in the way funds were apportioned among the states. Prior to MAP-21, Congress wrote authorizations for each individual apportioned program into law, and specified the formula factors that were used to determine each state's share of the authorization for that program. Beginning with MAP-21, all the large formula programs shared a single authorization amount, and the states' apportioned shares of the total authorization were determined before their amounts were divided among the specific programs. MAP-21 did not specify any formula factors that were to be used to apportion funds among the states. Instead, the apportionment was based primarily on each state's share of total apportionments in FY2012, the last year of SAFETEA, as extended. In practice, this meant that the main determinants of the totals apportioned among the states under MAP-21 were the relative distributions under the equity bonus program established in SAFETEA. In the MAP-21 formula, Congress addressed concerns about fairness from two different perspectives. On the one hand, it guaranteed that each state received an apportionment equal to at least 95 cents of every dollar the state's highway users paid in highway taxes. This represented an increase from the 92% return guaranteed in 2012, the final year of SAFETEA. On the other hand, by effectively fixing the apportionment shares at the FY2012 level Congress ensured that most states receiving more from the Federal-Aid Highway Program than their residents paid in federal highway taxes would still get increases in funding. As was true under the SAFETEA and earlier equity programs, some states could receive larger amounts without substantially reducing the amounts provided to other states only because of the large amounts of funding provided. This was possible because the bill transferred $18 billion from other Treasury accounts to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94 ), enacted in 2015, is the current authorization of federal highway programs. It made only modest changes to the MAP-21 apportionment mechanism. As was true with MAP-21, the FAST Act authorizes a single amount for each year for all the apportioned highway programs combined. It retained the basic MAP-21 formula and the basic MAP-21 programmatic structure. This means that while apportionments are still based primarily on each state's share of total apportionments in FY2012, the final year of SAFETEA, each state is guaranteed an apportionment equal to at least 95% of the amount its residents pay into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. Under the FAST Act, the authorization that funds six programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program is apportioned among the states by formula. The programs are the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), the Surface Transportation Block Grant program (STBG), the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), Metropolitan Planning (MP), and the National Highway Freight Program (NHFP). As summary of the process follows. Prior to calculating states' apportionments for FY2020, the Federal Highway Administration is to reserve two amounts, $67 million for NHPP and $1.020 billion for STBG. These reserve funds will later supplement these programs. The remaining amount, net of these two amounts, is the \"base apportionment amount.\" Each state's initial apportionment amounts are calculated for the three components (the base apportionment, supplemental NHPP, and supplemental STBG) by multiplying the base apportionment and two supplemental amounts by the ratio that each state's FY2015 apportionments bear to the nationwide total for FY2015. Next, the three initial amounts are adjusted, if necessary, to assure that each state's total base apportionment plus reserve funds is no less than 95 cents for every dollar the state contributed to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund in the most recent fiscal year for which data are available. Any necessary upward adjustments for some states are offset by proportional decreases to the amounts of other states. However, basing initial apportionment amounts on FY2015 apportionment shares and guaranteeing a 95-cents-on-the-dollar return to all states without major reductions in some states' funding requires a larger program than the existing Highway Trust Fund taxes can fund. As was true under MAP-21, large transfers from the Treasury general fund to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund authorized in the FAST Act made it possible to fund the Federal-Aid Highway Program in a way that would fulfill the 95% guarantee without having to reduce other states' apportionments significantly. Each state's base apportionment amount is used as the starting point in determining the division of the state's apportionment among the six apportioned programs. First, the amount determined for the NHFP is set aside from each state's base apportionment. Second, from the remaining amounts an amount is distributed for CMAQ (according to the state's FY2009 CMAQ apportionment share). Third, the state's MP program gets a distribution (based on the state's FY2009 apportionment share). Fourth, the remainder of the state's apportionment is divided among the three remaining core programs as follows: 63.7% is apportioned to the NHPP, 29.3% to the STBG, and 7% to the HSIP. Fifth, the STBG (each year FY2016-FY2020) and NHPP (for FY2019-FY2020 only) reserve funds are added to supplement each state's STBG and NHPP amounts calculated from the state's base apportionments. As described above, the procedure currently used to apportion federal highway funds among the states is not based on any particular policy objectives other than ensuring the stability of state shares based on the apportionment shares in the last year of MAP-21, FY2015. In addition, each state is guaranteed an amount at least equal to 95 cents on the dollar of the taxes paid by its residents into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. Some policy-related factors used to distribute highway funds in the past are no longer in use, while other possible factors sometimes mentioned in policy discussions, such as states' rates of population growth and projected increases in truck traffic, have never been used as formula factors. The following tables compare each state's share of highway apportionments under current law to that state's proportion of various factors that have been used in the past in the distribution of federal highway funds.

{"input": "", "context": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent federal agency, with its five members appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. It was established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\") and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The 1934 Act is divided into titles and sections that describe various powers and concerns of the commission. Title I—FCC Administration and Powers. The 1934 Act originally called for a commission consisting of seven members, but that number was reduced to five in 1983. Commissioners are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate to serve five-year terms; the President designates one member to serve as chairman. Title II—Common carrier regulation, primarily telephone regulation, including circuit-switched telephone services offered by cable companies. Common carriers are communication companies that provide facilities for transmission but do not originate messages, such as telephone and microwave providers. The 1934 Act limits FCC regulation to interstate and international common carriers, although a joint federal-state board coordinates regulation between the FCC and state regulatory commissions. Title III—Broadcast station requirements. Much existing broadcast regulation was established prior to 1934 by the Federal Radio Commission, and most provisions of the Radio Act of 1927 were subsumed into Title III of the 1934 Act. Title IV—Procedural and administrative provisions, such as hearings, joint boards, judicial review of the FCC's orders, petitions, and inquiries. Title V—Penal provisions and forfeitures, such as violations of rules and regulations. Title VI—Cable communications, such as the use of cable channels and cable ownership restrictions, franchising, and video programming services provided by telephone companies. Title VII—Miscellaneous provisions and powers, such as war powers of the President, closed captioning of public service announcements, and telecommunications development fund. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms (except when filling an unexpired term). The President designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party as the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. Ajit Pai, Chair (originally sworn in on May 14, 2012; designated chairman by President Trump in January 2017 and confirmed by the Senate for a second term on October 2, 2017); Michael O'Rielly (sworn in for a second term on January 29, 2015); Brendan Carr (sworn in on August 11, 2017); Jessica Rosenworcel (sworn in on August 11, 2017); and Geoffrey Starks (sworn in on January 30, 2019). The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006, largely in response to Hurricane Katrina. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. The bureaus hold the following responsibilities: Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau—Develops and implements consumer policies, including disability access and policies affecting Tribal nations. The Bureau serves as the public face of the Commission through outreach and education, as well as responding to consumer inquiries and informal complaints. The Bureau also maintains collaborative partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments in such critical areas as emergency preparedness and implementation of new technologies. In addition, the Bureau's Disability Rights Office provides expert policy and compliance advice on accessibility with respect to various forms of communications for persons with disabilities. Enforcement Bureau—Enforces the Communications Act and the FCC's rules. It protects consumers, ensures efficient use of spectrum, furthers public safety, promotes competition, resolves intercarrier disputes, and protects the integrity of FCC programs and activities from fraud, waste, and abuse. International Bureau—Administers the FCC's international telecommunications and satellite programs and policies, including licensing and regulatory functions. The Bureau promotes pro-competitive policies abroad, coordinating the FCC's global spectrum activities and advocating U.S. interests in international communications and competition. The Bureau works to promote high-quality, reliable, interconnected, and interoperable communications infrastructure on a global scale. Media Bureau—Recommends, develops, and administers the policy and licensing programs relating to electronic media, including broadcast, cable, and satellite television in the United States and its territories. Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau—Develops and implements policies and programs to strengthen public safety communications, homeland security, national security, emergency management and preparedness, disaster management, and network reliability. These efforts include rulemaking proceedings that promote more efficient use of public safety spectrum, improve public alerting mechanisms, enhance the nation's 911 emergency calling system, and establish frameworks for communications prioritization during crisis. The Bureau also maintains 24/7 operations capability and promotes Commission preparedness to assist the public, first responders, the communications industry, and all levels of government in responding to emergencies and major disasters where reliable public safety communications are essential. Wireless Telecommunications Bureau—Responsible for wireless telecommunications programs and policies in the United States and its territories, including licensing and regulatory functions. Wireless communications services include cellular, paging, personal communications, mobile broadband, and other radio services used by businesses and private citizens. Wireline Competition Bureau—Develops, recommends, and implements policies and programs for wireline telecommunications, including fixed (as opposed to mobile) broadband and telephone landlines, striving to promote the widespread development and availability of these services. The Bureau has primary responsibility for the Universal Service Fund which helps connect all Americans to communications networks. The offices hold the following responsibilities: Administrative Law Judges—Composed of one judge (and associated staff) who presides over hearings and issues decisions on matters referred by the FCC. Communications Business Opportunities—Promotes competition and innovation in the provision and ownership of telecommunications services by supporting opportunities for small businesses as well as women and minority-owned communications businesses. Economics and Analytics—Responsible for expanding and deepening the use of economic analysis into Commission policymaking, for enhancing the development and use of auctions, and for implementing consistent and effective agency-wide data practices and policies. The Office also manages the FCC's auctions in support of and in coordination with the FCC's Bureaus and Offices. In January 2019, the FCC voted along party lines to eliminate the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis and replace it with the Office of Economics and Analytics. Engineering and Technology—Advises the FCC on technical and engineering matters. This Office develops and administers FCC decisions regarding spectrum allocations and grants equipment authorizations and experimental licenses. General Counsel—Serves as the FCC's chief legal advisor and representative. Inspector General—Conducts and supervises audits and investigations relating to FCC programs and operations. Legislative Affairs—Serves as the liaison between the FCC and Congress, as well as other federal agencies. Managing Director—Administers and manages the FCC. Media Relations—Informs the media of FCC decisions and serves as the FCC's main point of contact with the media. Workplace Diversity—Ensures that FCC provides employment opportunities for all persons regardless of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, age, disability, or sexual orientation. Additionally, an FCC Secretary serves to preserve the integrity of the FCC's records, oversee the receipt and distribution of documents filed by the public through electronic and paper filing systems, and give effective legal notice of FCC decisions by publishing them in the Federal Register and the FCC Record . The current FCC Strategic Plan covers the five-year period FY2018-FY2022. The plan outlines four goals: Closing the Digital Divide—Broadband is acknowledged as being critical to economic opportunity, but broadband is unavailable or unaffordable in many parts of the country. The FCC is to seek to help close the digital divide, bring down the cost of broadband deployment, and create incentives for providers to connect consumers in hard-to-serve areas. Promoting Innovation—Fostering a competitive, dynamic, and innovative market for communications services is a key priority for the FCC. The FCC plans to promote entrepreneurship, expand economic opportunity, and remove barriers to entry and investment. Protecting Consumers and Public Safety—Serving the broader public interest is the FCC's core mission. The FCC plans to work to combat unwanted and unlawful robocalls, make communications accessible for people with disabilities, and protect public safety (e.g., ensuring delivery of 9-1-1 calls, restoring communications after disasters). Reforming the FCC's Processes—One of the chairman's top priorities has been to implement process reforms to make the work of the FCC more transparent, open, and accountable to the public. The FCC plans to modernize and streamline its operations and programs to improve decisionmaking, build consensus, and reduce regulatory burdens. The FCC has identified performance objectives associated with each strategic goal. Commission management annually develops targets and measures related to each performance goal to provide direction toward accomplishing those goals. Targets and measures are published in the FCC's Performance Plan, and submitted with the commission's annual budget request to Congress. Results of the commission's efforts to meet its goals, targets, and measures are found in the FCC's Annual Performance Report published each February. The FCC also issues a Summary of Performance and Financial Results every February, providing a concise, citizen-focused review of the agency's accomplishments. Since the 110 th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. The FCC annually collects and retains regulatory fees to offset costs incurred by the agency and to carry out its functions. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities (e.g., cable television systems). The regulatory fees do not apply to governmental entities, amateur radio operator licensees, nonprofit entities, and certain other non-commercial entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. The Commission originally implemented the Regulatory Fee Collection Program by rulemaking on July 18, 1994. The most recent regulatory fee order was released by the Commission on August 29, 2018. The FCC's budgets from FY2010 to FY2020 are in Figure 1 . On March 23, 2018, the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services Act of 2018 (the \"RAY BAUM'S Act\" or \"2018 Act\") became law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ). The 2018 Act requires the FCC to transfer all excess collections for FY2018 and prior years to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for the sole purpose of deficit reduction. The 2018 Act also requires the Commission to transfer any excess collections in FY2019 and in subsequent years to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for the sole purpose of deficit reduction. On October 1, 2018, the Commission transferred over $9 million in excess collections from FY2018 as well as approximately $112 million in excess collections from FY2017 and prior years to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. This is $3,950,000 less than the authorization level of $339,610,000 included in the 2018 FCC Reauthorization in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The FY2020 FCC request also represents a decrease of $3,340,000, or about 1.0%, from the FY2019 appropriated level of $339,000,000. The FCC requested $132,538,680 in budget authority for the spectrum auctions program. For FY2019, Congress appropriated a cap of $130,284,000 for the spectrum auctions program, which included additional funds to implement the requirements of the 2018 Act that mandated significant additional work for the FCC related to the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund. The Commission's FY2020 budget request of $132,538,680 for this program would be an increase of $2,254,680, or 1.7%, over the FY2019 appropriation. This level of funding is intended to enable the Commission to continue its efforts to: reimburse full power and Class A stations, multichannel video programming distributors, Low Power TV, TV translator, and FM stations for reasonable costs incurred as a result of the Commission's incentive auction; make more spectrum available for 5G; and educate consumers affected by the reorganization of broadcast television spectrum. To date, the Commission's spectrum auctions program has generated over $114.6 billion for government use; at the same time, the total cost of the auctions program has been less than $2.0 billion, or less than 1.7% of the total auctions' revenue. Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), the FCC was reauthorized for the first time since 1990 (FCC Authorization Act of 1990, P.L. 101-396 ). The FCC publishes four periodic reports for Congress. Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan is the framework around which the FCC develops its yearly Performance Plan and Performance Budget. The FCC submitted its current four-year Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 in February 2018, in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010, P.L. 111-352 . Performance Budget. The annual Performance Budget includes performance targets based on the FCC's strategic goals and objectives, and serves as the guide for implementing the Strategic Plan. The Performance Budget becomes part of the President's annual budget request. Agency Financial Report. The annual Agency Financial Report contains financial and other information, such as a financial discussion and analysis of the agency's status, financial statements, and audit reports. Annual Performance Report. At the end of the fiscal year, the FCC publishes an Annual Performance Report that compares the agency's actual performance with its targets. All of these reports are available on the FCC website, https://www.fcc.gov/about/strategic-plans-budget . One FCC-related hearing has been held in the 116 th Congress. On April 3, 2019, the House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government held a hearing on the FY2020 FCC budget. The hearing addressed issues including 5G deployment, federal preemption of state and local tower siting requirements, merger reviews, robocalls, and net neutrality. No bills that would affect the operation of the FCC have been introduced in the 116 th Congress. The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69 th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on which of two regulatory philosophies is relied upon to interpret it. The first seeks to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while the second seeks to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances, and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. This evolution can be illustrated in changes to the agency's strategic goals under former Chairman Tom Wheeler to current Chairman Ajit Pai, which, in turn, led to the repeal in 2017 of the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules and to changes in the agency's structure in 2019. The FCC's strategic goals are set forth in its quadrennial Strategic Plan. How these goals change from one plan to the next can illustrate how the priorities of the commission change over time, especially when there is a change in the political majority of the commission and therefore, the political party of the chairman. Table 1 outlines the strategic goals of Chairman Wheeler in the FY2015-FY2018 Strategic Plan compared to those of Chairman Pai in the FY2018-FY2022 Strategic Plan. Chairman Wheeler was a proponent of protecting and benefitting the public through regulation. His support of this regulatory philosophy can be seen in the language used in the strategic goals, such as the \"rights of users\" and the \"responsibilities of network providers.\" Another example can be seen in the following language: \"The FCC has a responsibility to promote the expansion of these networks and to ensure they have the incentive and the ability to compete fairly with one another in providing broadband services.\" On the other hand, Chairman Pai speaks about protecting and benefitting the public through the promotion of market incentives and efficiency. His support of this regulatory philosophy can be seen in the language used in the strategic goals, such as \"reducing regulatory burdens\" and ensuring that \"regulations reflect the realities of the current marketplace, promote entrepreneurship, expand economic opportunity, and remove barriers to entry and investment.\" The use of this particular language may seem somewhat vague, but within the context of the net neutrality debate, discussed below, and the replacement of the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis with the Office of Economics and Analytics, those words take on more specific meaning, each intending to support the policy agenda of the Chairman. Net neutrality is arguably the highest profile issue illustrating the two regulatory philosophies described above. Chairman Pai had long maintained that the FCC under Chairman Wheeler had overstepped its bounds, expressing confidence that the 2015 Wheeler-era net neutrality rules would be undone, calling them \"unnecessary regulations that hold back investment and innovation.\" Although the net neutrality debate originated in 2005, the 2015 Open Internet Order, implemented under the leadership of Chairman Wheeler, and the 2017 Order overturning those rules, promulgated under Chairman Pai, are the most recent. These two orders can be used to illustrate the contrast between the regulatory philosophies of the two chairmen: Some policymakers contend that more proscriptive regulations, such as those contained in the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order (2015 Order), are necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses which could threaten the net neutrality concept. Others contend that existing laws and the current, less restrictive approach, contained in the FCC's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order (2017 Order), provide a more suitable framework. Net neutrality continues to be a highly politicized issue, with most FCC action being approved along party lines. In January 2019, the FCC voted along party lines to eliminate the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis and replace it with a new Office of Economics and Analytics. The Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis (OSP) was created in 2005, replacing the Office of Plans and Policy. OSP had been charged with \"providing advice to the chairman, commissioners, bureaus, and offices; developing strategic plans; identifying the agency's policy objectives; and providing research, advice, and analysis of advanced, novel, and nontraditional communications issues.\" It had also been the home of the Chief Economist and Chief Technologist. The new Office of Economics and Analytics is \"responsible for expanding and deepening the use of economic analysis into FCC policy making, for enhancing the development and use of auctions, and for implementing consistent and effective agency-wide data practices and policies.\" This new office reflects the goals in the current strategic plan: We will modernize and streamline the FCC's operations and programs to … reduce regulatory burdens…. A key priority [is to] … ensure that the FCC's actions and regulations reflect the realities of the current marketplace … and remove barriers to entry and investment. As the FCC continues to conduct its business into the future, the changing regulatory philosophies of the FCC chairmen may continue to drive how the FCC defines its long-term, strategic goals. This, in turn, may affect how the agency structures (and restructures) itself and how it decides regulatory questions, including a continued review of net neutrality. Congress may determine that the public interest standard should remain more static, rather than fluctuating dramatically depending on the regulatory philosophy of the chairman. No legislation on this topic has been introduced in Congress, signaling to some observers that it intends to continue allowing the FCC to define it. Table A-1 .

The agency is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to make available for all people of the United States, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on how \"the public interest\" is interpreted. Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item.

{"input": "", "context": "In our June 2017 report, we found that FirstNet has conducted key efforts to establish the network, namely releasing the request for proposal for the network in January 2016 and awarding the network contract to AT&T in March 2017. As the contractor, AT&T will be responsible for the overall design, development, production, operation, and evolution of the network, as well as the marketing, product management, sales, distribution, and customer care. Further, we found that FirstNet has established a framework to meet the financial requirements established in the 2012 Act, as depicted in figure 1. This framework focuses on leveraging FirstNet’s spectrum through the use of payments and fees with the aim of ensuring that the network is financially sustainable over the life of the contract and that FirstNet sustains self-funding operations. By establishing a single, dedicated network for public safety use, FirstNet’s network is expected to foster greater interoperability and meet public safety officials’ reliability and other needs. However, the actual use (or “adoption”) of the network by public safety users will be voluntary. Thus, even with the establishment of this framework, substantial unknowns remain regarding how many public safety users will adopt the network, the extent to which AT&T will be successful in monetizing the spectrum to retain revenue from commercial users, and the extent to which this revenue will be sufficient or appropriate in relation to the capital needed to build, operate, and maintain the network. Therefore, we noted that, at the time of our report, we could not assess the viability of this framework and whether FirstNet’s structures for overseeing the contractor’s use of the spectrum for commercial users will be appropriate. We also found that FirstNet has made progress consulting with state and local, federal, and tribal stakeholders through a variety of mechanisms. State officials we contacted were generally satisfied with FirstNet’s efforts to engage them. However, tribal stakeholders we contacted expressed concern with FirstNet’s efforts to consult with tribes per the 2012 Act’s requirements. In particular, four of the five tribal organizations we contacted said that FirstNet has not fully engaged in effective communication or has relied on state points of contact too much as opposed to engaging directly with tribes; the other tribal organization was not aware of FirstNet or its mission at all. Further, tribes noted that individuals with first-hand knowledge of tribes’ experiences are not able to represent tribal views directly among FirstNet’s key decision makers. FirstNet has stated that, indeed, the 2012 Act requires that it consult with tribes through state points of contact. Nevertheless, several federal agencies have identified seeking a full understanding of tribal concerns— and reaching consensus where possible—as a key principle of effective tribal communication, noting that agencies should adapt to changing circumstances, contemplate creative problem solving, identify options for addressing concerns, and exhaust alternatives to achieve mutually agreeable solutions. We concluded that, by fully exploring and proposing actions to address tribal stakeholders’ concerns, FirstNet could help improve its relations with tribes and better meet stakeholders’ needs. As such, we recommended in our report that FirstNet fully explore tribal concerns and propose actions, as needed, to address those concerns. FirstNet agreed with this recommendation and, in September 2017, described to us the actions it has taken to implement it. For example, according to FirstNet, in September 2017 it began a process to formally explore the tribal outreach concerns raised in our report and expects to propose improvements by the end of this year. FirstNet has also said that it adopted an organization-wide tribal consultation policy which it expects to take effect towards the end of this year. If implemented as planned, these actions should address the intent of the recommendation. In our report, we found that—according to stakeholders we contacted— FirstNet faces various challenges to ensure the network’s reliability, security, and interoperability. For example, stakeholders raised concerns related to: providing network coverage to rural areas, in buildings, or ensuring the network’s overall resiliency and cybersecurity; and managing frameworks for user identity, credentialing of users, access management, and prioritization of users on the network. However, we also found that both FirstNet and the PSCR have begun research and other efforts to help ensure the reliability, security, and interoperability of the network and address the challenges raised by stakeholders. For example, in November 2016, FirstNet opened an Innovation and Test Lab at its technical headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. According to FirstNet documentation, FirstNet plans to use— and allow AT&T to use—the lab to test public safety devices and applications before deploying them on the network. Additionally, the PSCR has conducted research on behalf of FirstNet and, using $300 million in funds provided to NIST by the 2012 Act, is also planning for and implementing other research activities to support FirstNet. For instance, in January 2016, PSCR launched its Public Safety Innovation Accelerator Program to support these research activities, and in December 2016, NIST issued a funding announcement to fund research in several areas. At the time of our report, we found that PSCR’s research process generally aligned with key phases of sound research programs identified by leading national organizations, including the American Evaluation Association and the National Academy of Sciences. For example, PSCR has established a structured process for developing research priorities that includes both internal and external stakeholders, and has identified criteria it uses to help it select the research areas to fund and procedures to help it guide and monitor its research. Similarly, FirstNet has determined its research priorities to date based on its network- planning needs and in consultation with internal and external stakeholders, and worked with the PSCR to define criteria to help it select research areas. Further, we found that the majority of stakeholders we contacted were satisfied with the planning efforts to ensure the reliability, security, and interoperability of the network. However, many stakeholders also said that there is much remaining uncertainty about how this will be implemented in practice. Additionally, one public safety official we contacted told us that FirstNet and its contractor will have to balance the costs associated with implementing features that make the network reliable and secure with the need to establish compelling and competitively priced service packages and fees that will encourage user adoption of the network. Indeed, numerous stakeholders we contacted cited the cost of subscribing to the network as a key factor affecting user adoption, noting that the pricing must be comparable to what they pay for commercial service now, that budgets are constrained in the public safety community, or that local governments do not want costs to increase. Further, commercial carriers could choose to compete with FirstNet. FirstNet has stated that it expects AT&T to provide services at a competitive price and deliver affordable, high-quality services that will encourage public safety users to adopt the network. Ultimately—because the network must be self-funding and FirstNet has stated that revenue from network users will be critical to this funding—the success of the network depends on whether FirstNet and AT&T generate enough revenue to operate it over the long term and whether public safety users adopt it, no matter how reliable and secure it is. FirstNet must manage and oversee the implementation of the network contract to build, operate, and maintain the network. Federal internal- control standards also state that an entity’s management retains responsibility for the performance of processes assigned to service organizations (such as contractors) and that management should hold these organizations accountable for their performance. In our report, we found that FirstNet has taken a number of steps to establish contract oversight mechanisms, but has not fully assessed the staffing needs of its oversight workforce. FirstNet’s oversight mechanisms include developing policies and procedures to guide contract administration and establishing offices to oversee its network contractor. In particular, FirstNet established the Network Program Office to oversee the contractor’s performance and facilitate quality assurance of contract deliverables, among other things. FirstNet is also receiving assistance from the Department of the Interior, which has experience with contract administration, although FirstNet plans to assume full responsibility for contract administration in the future. We also found that FirstNet’s efforts to develop contract oversight mechanisms aligned with several key actions that we identified as contributing to effective contract oversight. However, although FirstNet’s Network Program Office will perform essential contract administration functions, FirstNet had not conducted long-term projections of staffing needs for the office as of April 2017. Planning for and assigning adequate resources, including people, and performing an assessment of the resources needed to oversee projects is one of the key actions we identified for planning and executing effective contract oversight. We concluded that FirstNet lacks reasonable assurance that it will have sufficient resources to handle increases in its responsibilities over time and that, by performing a long-term staffing assessment for the Network Program Office, FirstNet would be in a better position to fully understand its staffing needs and respond to staffing changes and risks as it assumes full responsibility of contract administration in the future. As such, we recommended in our report that FirstNet assess the long-term staffing needs in the Network Program Office prior to assuming full responsibility for administering the network contract. FirstNet agreed with this recommendation and, in September 2017, described the actions it has taken to implement it. According to FirstNet, in August 2017 the Network Program Office adopted a strategic workforce plan for fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which it expects to update annually. According to FirstNet, this plan provides a comprehensive view of current and future human capital needs required to support the implementation of the network and identifies strategies the office will employ to fill gaps between current and future needs, among other things. If implemented as planned, this action should address the intent of the recommendation. Chairman Donovan, Ranking Member Payne, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

To inform this work, FirstNet is consulting with a variety of stakeholders. In March 2017, FirstNet awarded a 25-year contract to AT&T to build, operate, and maintain the network. FirstNet's oversight of AT&T's performance is important given the scope of the network and the duration of the contract. This testimony provides information on (1) FirstNet's efforts to establish the network; (2) stakeholder views on network reliability, security, and interoperability challenges FirstNet faces and its efforts to address them; and (3) FirstNet's plans to oversee its network contractor. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report ( GAO-17-569 ). For this report, GAO reviewed FirstNet documentation, key contract oversight practices identified in federal regulations and other sources, tribal communication practices identified by federal agencies, and assessed FirstNet's efforts and plans against these practices. GAO also interviewed FirstNet officials and a nongeneralizable selection of public safety, tribal, and other stakeholders selected to obtain a variety of viewpoints. In June 2017, GAO reported that the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) had conducted key efforts to establish the network, namely releasing the request for proposal (RFP) for the network and awarding the network contract to AT&T. As the contractor, AT&T will be responsible for the overall design, development, production, operation, and evolution of the network.

{"input": "", "context": "In November 2011, we reported that over the previous decade, the FBI and GSA conducted a number of studies to assess the Hoover Building and its other headquarters facilities’ strategic and mission needs. Through these studies, they determined the condition of the FBI’s current assets and identified gaps between current and needed capabilities, as well as studied a range of alternatives to meet the FBI’s requirements. According to these assessments, the FBI’s headquarters facilities did not fully support the FBI’s long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since our report, the assessment of the Hoover Building has not materially changed. For example: Security: Since September 11, 2001, the FBI mission and workforce have expanded, and the FBI has outgrown the Hoover Building. As a result, the FBI also operates in annexes, including some located in the National Capital Region. During our 2011 review, FBI security officials told us that they have some security concerns—to varying degrees— about the Hoover Building and some of the headquarters annexes. In our report, we noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes created security challenges, particularly for at least nine annexes that were located in multitenant buildings, where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. While this arrangement did not automatically put FBI operations at risk, it heightened security concerns. In addition, in January 2017, we found that the FBI occupies space leased from foreign owners in at least six different locations, including one in Washington, D.C. Further, federal officials who assess foreign investments told us at that time that leasing space in foreign-owned buildings could present security risks, such as espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access. Space: In 2011, we reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover building’s approximately 2.4 million gross square feet of space is unusable, and the remaining usable space is not designed to meet the needs of today’s FBI. Moreover, the Hoover Building’s original design is inefficient, according to GSA assessments, making it difficult to reconfigure space to promote staff collaboration. For example, in its fiscal year 2017 prospectus for the proposed FBI headquarters consolidation project, GSA noted that the Hoover Building was designed at a time when FBI operated differently, and it cannot be redeveloped to provide the necessary space to consolidate the FBI Headquarters components or to meet the agency’s current and projected operational requirements. As a result, the FBI reported facing several operational and logistical challenges. We similarly noted in our prior work in 2011 that space constraints at the Hoover Building and the resulting dispersion of staff sometimes prevented the FBI from physically locating certain types of analysts and specialists together, which in turn hampered collaboration and the performance of some classified work. Building condition: In our 2011 report, we noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments had identified significant recapitalization needs. At that time, we found that GSA had decided to limit investments in the Hoover Building to those necessary to protect health and safety and keep building systems functioning while GSA assessed the FBI’s facility needs. We found that this decision increased the potential for building system failures and disruption to the FBI’s operations. Given that the FBI would likely remain in the building for at least several more years, we recommended that GSA evaluate its strategy to minimize major repair and recapitalization investments and take action to address any facility condition issues that could put FBI operations at risk and lead to further deterioration of the building. In 2014, in response to our recommendation, GSA evaluated its strategy for the Hoover Building and determined it needed to complete some repairs to ensure safety and maintain tenancy in the building. For example, in 2014, GSA funded contracts to waterproof portions of the building’s mezzanine level to prevent water intrusion into the building and repair the concrete facade, small sections of which had cracked and fallen from the building. In July 2017, GSA and FBI officials stated that they cancelled the procurement for the new FBI headquarters consolidation project, noting that the there was a lack of funding necessary to complete the procurement. GSA added that the cancellation of the procurement did not lessen the need for a new FBI headquarters, and that GSA and the FBI would continue to work together to address the space requirements of the FBI. In July 2014, we reported that the swap exchange approach can help GSA address the challenges of disposing of unneeded property and modernizing or replacing federal buildings. GSA officials told us that swap exchanges can help GSA facilitate construction projects given a growing need to modernize and replace federal properties, shrinking federal budgets, and challenges obtaining funding. Specifically, GSA officials noted that swap exchanges allow GSA to immediately apply the value of a federal property to be used in the exchange to construction needs, rather than attempting to obtain funds through the appropriations process. In our 2014 report, GSA officials stated that the exchanges can be attractive because the agency can get construction projects accomplished without having to request full upfront funding for them from Congress. In addition, because swap exchanges require developers or other property recipients to complete the agreed-upon GSA construction projects prior to the transfer of the title to the current property GSA is exchanging, federal agencies can continue to occupy the property during the construction process for the new project, eliminating the need for agencies to lease or acquire other space to occupy during the construction process. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and has cancelled several recently proposed swap exchanges. More specifically, in 2016 we reported that GSA had only completed transactions using the swap exchange authority for two small (under $10-million each) swap exchanges completed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2001 and in San Antonio, Texas, in 2012. Furthermore, GSA has faced a number of obstacles in its use of this authority. For example, for our 2014 report, we reviewed five projects identified since August 2012 in which GSA solicited market interest in exchanging almost 8-million square feet in federal property for construction services or newly constructed assets. However, GSA chose not to pursue swap-exchanges in all five of these projects, including the proposed FBI headquarters consolidation project. For example, GSA officials told us that there was little or no market interest in potential swap exchanges in Baltimore, Maryland, and Miami, Florida, and that GSA chose to pursue different approaches. Respondents to the solicitations for these two GSA swap exchanges noted that GSA did not provide important details, including the amount of investment needed in the federal properties and GSA’s specific construction needs. In addition, from 2012 to 2015, GSA pursued a larger swap exchange potentially involving up to 5 federal properties located in the Federal Triangle South area of Washington, D.C., to finance construction at GSA headquarters and other federal properties. In 2013, GSA decided to focus on exchanging two buildings, the GSA Regional Office Building and the Cotton Annex, based on input from potential investors. On February 18, 2016, GSA decided to end its pursuit of the exchange, saying in a memorandum supporting this decision that private investor valuations for the two buildings fell short of the government’s estimated values. After the discontinuation of the Federal Triangle swap exchange project, we reported in 2016 that GSA officials noted they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential project risks for future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. However, we also reported that several factors may continue to limit the applicability of the agency’s approach. Specifically, the viability of swap exchanges may be affected by specific market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties. In addition, the specific valuation approach used by appraisers or potential investors may reduce the viability of the swap exchange. For example, in reviewing the proposed Federal Triangle project, we found in 2016 that the proposals from two of the investment firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA’s appraised property value. In addition, swap exchanges can require developers to spend large sums on GSA’s construction needs before receiving title to the federal property used in the exchanges. We found in 2014 that GSA’s solicitations have not always specified these construction needs in sufficient detail. Consequently, developers may be unable to provide meaningful input, and GSA could miss swap exchange opportunities. In 2014, we recommended that GSA develop criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange. GSA agreed with the recommendation and has since updated its guidance to include these criteria. In January 2017, GSA agreed to a swap exchange for the U.S. Department of Transportation Volpe Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After a competitive process, GSA selected the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as its exchange partner for the existing Department of Transportation (DOT) facility. Per the agreement, MIT will construct a new DOT facility on a portion of a 14 acre site to which DOT has title and, in exchange, will receive title to the remaining portion of the site that will not be used by DOT, which is located near its main campus. GSA indicated that, once completed, the project will provide $750 million in value to the federal government in the form of the design and construction services and value-equalization funds from MIT. Our prior work has identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. In March 2014, we reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and to maintain fiscal controls. However, obtaining upfront funding for large acquisitions such as the Hoover Building replacement can be challenging. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding. Table 1 outlines selected funding mechanisms, and considerations for each mechanism we identified in our 2014 report. Some of these alternative mechanisms allow selected agencies to meet their real property needs by leveraging other authorized resources, such as retained fees or land swaps with a private sector partner. Funding mechanisms leverage both monetary resources, such as retained fees, and non-monetary resources, such as property exchanged in a land swap or space offered in an enhanced use lease. In some cases, the funding mechanism may function as a public-private partnership intended to further an agency’s mission by working with a partner to leverage resources. Some of these mechanisms allow the private sector to provide the project’s capital—at their cost of borrowing. The U.S. federal government’s cost of borrowing is lower than the private sector’s. When the private sector provides the project capital, the federal government later repays these higher private sector borrowing costs (e.g., in the form of lease payments). In some cases, factors such as lower labor costs or fewer requirements could potentially help balance the higher cost of borrowing, making partner financing less expensive. Our 2014 report also identifies budgetary options—within the bounds of the current unified budget—to meet real property needs while helping Congress and agencies make more prudent long-term decisions. In 2014, we reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. Further, we noted project decisions should reflect both the likely risk and the organization’s tolerance for risk. Incorporating risk assessment and management practices into decisions can help organizations recognize and prepare to manage explicit risks (e.g. financial and physical) and implicit risks (e.g. reputational). For example, clearly defined lease terms may help agencies manage risks of costs for unexpected building repairs. Further considerations we noted in our 2014 report include the availability of an appropriate partner—and that partners should bring complementary resources, skills, and financial capacities to the relationship—and management of the relationship with that partner. While different funding mechanisms have been used as an alternative to obtaining upfront funding for federal real property projects, changes to the budgetary structure itself—within the bounds of the unified budget that encompasses the full scope of federal programs and transactions—may also help agencies meet their real property needs. Such alternatives may include changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. Our previous work identified options for changes within the current discretionary budget structure and options on the mandatory side of the budget. Alternative budgetary structures may change budgetary incentives for agencies and therefore help Congress and agencies make more prudent long-term fiscal decisions.

One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building. GSA agreed with these two recommendations and addressed them."], "length": 2981, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e590c1f5c3246e8822dc120c17ff9599e227ee1a763b2bba"}
{"input": "", "context": "Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) constitute the Army's \"light\" ground forces and are an important part of the nation's ability to rapidly project forces overseas. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as current thinking as to where and how future conflicts would be fought, suggest IBCTs are limited operationally by their lack of assigned transport and reconnaissance vehicles as well as firepower against hardened targets and armored vehicles. To address these limitations, the Army is undertaking three programs: the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)/Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), formerly known as the Ultra-Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV); the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV); and the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) programs. These programs would be based on vehicles that are commercially available. This is in order to reduce costs and the time it takes to field combat vehicles associated with traditional developmental efforts. Congress may be concerned with the effectiveness of ground forces over the full spectrum of military operations. A number of past unsuccessful Army acquisition programs have served to heighten congressional oversight of Army programs, including nondevelopmental programs such as those currently being proposed for IBCTs. In addition to these primary concerns, how these new programs affect deployability and sustainability of IBCTs as well as affordability could be potential oversight issues for Congress. Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) are the basic combined-arms formations of the Army. They are permanent, stand-alone, self-sufficient, and standardized tactical forces consisting of between 3,900 to 4,100 soldiers. There are three types of BCTs: Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs); Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs); and Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs). BCTs are found both in the Active Component and the U.S. Army National Guard (USARNG). In February 2017 the Army announced it would establish six Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs)—five in the Active Component and one in the Army National Guard (ARNG). SFABs are to be capable of conducting security force assistance (SFA) operations at the tactical (brigade and below) level. While not combat brigades per se, the Army plans for SFABs to be expanded, if the need arises, into fully operational ABCTs or IBCTs capable of conducting major combat operations. Light IBCTs are primarily foot-mobile forces. Light IBCTs can move by foot, vehicle, or air (either air landed or by helicopter). While IBCTs have light- and medium-wheeled vehicles for transport, there are not enough vehicles to transport all or even a significant portion of the IBCT's infantry assets in a single movement. Airborne IBCTs are specially trained and equipped to conduct parachute assaults. They are equipped with limited vehicular assets, and once they have conducted a parachute assault, they move by foot, vehicle, or helicopter, just like Light IBCTs. Air Assault IBCTs are specially trained and equipped to conduct helicopter assaults. What sets them apart from Light and Airborne IBCTs (which can also conduct helicopter assaults) is that they receive additional specialized training; the division to which these BCTs are assigned—the 101 st Airborne Division—has the primary mission and organic helicopter assets to conduct large-scale helicopter assaults. The Army's Field Manual on Brigade Combat Teams describes how IBCTs are employed as follows: The role of the IBCT is to close with the enemy using fire and movement to destroy or capture enemy forces, or to repel enemy attacks by fire, close combat, and counterattack. Fire and movement is the concept of applying fires from all sources to suppress, neutralize, or destroy the enemy, and the tactical movement of combat forces in relation to the enemy (as components of maneuver applicable at all echelons). At the squad level, fire and movement entails a team placing suppressive fire on the enemy as another team moves against or around the enemy. The IBCT performs complementary missions to SBCTs and ABCTs. IBCT complementary missions include control of land areas, populations, and resources. The IBCT optimizes for the offense against conventional, hybrid, and irregular threats in severely restrictive terrain. The IBCT performs missions such as reducing fortified areas, infiltrating and seizing objectives in the enemy's rear, eliminating enemy force remnants in restricted terrain, securing key facilities and activities, and conducting stability in the wake of maneuvering forces. IBCTs easily configure for area defense and as the fixing force component of a mobile defense. The IBCT's lack of heavy combat vehicles reduces its logistic requirements. Not having heavy combat vehicles gives higher commanders greater flexibility when adapting various transportation modes to move or maneuver the IBCT. Chief of Staff of the Army General Mark A. Milley characterizes the operational environment confronting the Army as follows: I believe we are on the cusp of a fundamental change in the character of war. Technology, geopolitics and demographics are rapidly changing societies, economies, and the tools of warfare. They are also producing changes in why, how and where wars are fought—and who will fight them. The significantly increased speed and global reach of information (and misinformation) likewise will have unprecedented effects on forces and how they fight. For example, the proliferation of effective long-range radars, air defense systems, long-range precision weapons, electronic warfare, and cyber capabilities enables adversary states to threaten our partners and allies. Even if we do not fight the producers of these sophisticated weapons, warfare will become more lethal as they export this advanced equipment to their surrogates or customers. Crises involving such adversaries will unfold rapidly, compressing decision cycles and heightening the risks of miscalculation or escalation. Conflict will place a premium on speed of recognition, decision, assembly and action. Ambiguous actors, intense information wars and cutting-edge technologies will further confuse situational understanding and blur the distinctions between war and peace, combatant and noncombatant, friend and foe—perhaps even humans and machines. Warfare in the future will involve transporting, fighting and sustaining geographically dispersed Army, joint and multinational forces over long and contested distances, likely into an opposed environment and possibly against a technologically sophisticated and numerically superior enemy. All domains will be viciously contested, and both air and maritime superiority—which have been unquestioned American advantages for at least 75 years—will no longer be a given. Forces in theater should expect to operate under increased public scrutiny, persistent enemy surveillance, and massed precision long-range fires with area effects. Close combat on sensor-rich battlefields of the future will be faster, more violent and intensely lethal, unlike anything any of us have witnessed. And the majority of our operations will likely occur in complex, densely populated urban terrain. In relation to this operational environment, IBCTs are presented with the following challenges: In the past, light infantry of the 82 nd Airborne, 101 st or 10 th Mountain Division would either air drop by parachute, helicopter air assault, or air land at a friendly or secured airfield or land near one to seize it. However, Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) technology and weapons, like air defense systems and anti-armor, mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), have become both more effective and prevalent. These open the question of whether traditional insertion drop or landing zone is feasible any longer. It is increasingly likely that an \"off set insertion\" will be necessary with the ground force then moving by land to the objective or operating area. The concept itself is largely an upscaling of what U.S. and other nations' special operations, reconnaissance, and even some airborne units have been doing for some time: using light vehicles, including light armored vehicles that are inserted by airdrop, helicopter, or tactical transport air landing. Using the vehicles they are able to insert discretely where they are unlikely to be detected and then conduct their missions. The Army describes IBCT critical capability gaps as The IBCT lacks the ability to decisively close with and destroy the enemy under restricted terrains such as mountains, littorals, jungles, subterranean areas, and urban areas to minimize excessive physical burdens imposed by organic material systems. The IBCT lacks the ability to maneuver and survive in close combat against hardened enemy fortifications, light armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel. IBCTs lack the support of a mobile protected firepower capability to apply immediate, lethal, long-range direct fires in the engagement of hardened enemy bunkers, light armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel in machine gun and sniper positions; with all-terrain mobility and scalable armor protection; capable of conducting operations in all environments. In its current configuration, Army officials note that IBCTs \"can get there fast with low logistics demand, and they can work in severely restricted terrain, but they lack mobility and protected firepower\" to \"enter a foreign territory, immediately overcome armed opposition and hold an area that enables further troops to enter, like an airfield.\" The Army's concept of operation for these vehicles is to increase ground tactical mobility in the IBCT; allow infantry squads and rifle companies to quickly move extended distances over difficult terrain to seize assault objectives; allow rapid deployment into contested areas while providing high mobility and flexibility upon arrival; and limit the impact on strategic mobility of the IBCT. In this regard, the GMV/ISV is intended to provide mobility to the rifle squad and company; the LRV to provide protection to the moving force by means of scouts, sensors, and a variety of medium-caliber weapons; and the MPF to provide the overall IBCT the capability to more effectively engage and destroy fortifications, bunkers, buildings, and light to medium armored vehicles. The GMV/ISV, LRV, and MPF are briefly described in the following sections based on each individual vehicle's requirements. Payload: Nine soldiers/3,200 pounds capacity. Transportability: UH-60 sling load/CH-47 internal load; Air drop from C-130. Mobility: Provide mobility 75% cross-country; 10% primary roads; 10% secondary roads; 5% urban rubble environment. Protection: Provided by high mobility avoiding enemy contact and soldier Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). Lethality: Provide capability to host crew-served weapons assigned to the infantry squad. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Reconnaissance, and Surveillance (C4ISR): No requirement for added communication equipment or Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) organic equipment of the infantry squad. Transportability: CH-47 internal load (in combat configuration). Air drop from C-130. Range: Greater than 300 miles on internal fuel. Mobility : Provide mobility 75% cross-country; 10% primary roads; 10% secondary roads; 5% urban rubble environment. Lethality: Medium-caliber weapon system to provide precision \"stand-off\" lethality against small arms and offense against light armored vehicles. Protection: Protection from small arms. Capacity: Six scouts with combat equipment. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Reconnaissance, and Surveillance (C4ISR): Ensure sufficient Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) to facilitate the integration of current and future communications organic to an IBCT. Support scout sensor package. R ange: 300 kilometer range; 24-hour operations \"off the ramp\" or on \"arrival at drop zone (DZ).\" Mobility: Capable of traversing steep hills, valleys typical in cross-country and urban terrain, and ford depths equal to that of other organic IBCT vehicles. Lethality: Ability to defeat defensive fortifications (bunkers), urban targets (behind the wall), and armored combat vehicles. Protection: Scalable armor to include underbelly protection. Communications Network: SWaP-C sufficient to support current and future communications organic to an IBCT. The following sections provide brief programmatic overviews of the vehicles. Figure 4 depicts the Department of Defense (DOD) Systems Acquisition Framework, which illustrates the various phases of systems development and acquisitions and is applicable to the procurement of these three systems. The Army plans to acquire the vehicles as modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI) platforms. Because the Army adopted the NDI acquisition approach for all three vehicles, the Army can enter the programs at Acquisition Milestone C: Production and Deployment, and forgo the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase associated with developmental items (systems developed \"from scratch\") if so desired. Variations of these vehicles already exist commercially, and in order to meet Army requirements, they would require minor modifications. The Army chose this acquisition strategy because a survey of potential candidates suggested a number of existing vehicles—with minor modifications—could meet the Army's requirements. In the case of the MPF, which was less well-developed than the GMV, the MPF underwent an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) as part of the Material Solution Analysis phase, which was completed September 7, 2017. Theoretically, adopting a NDI approach for all three vehicles could lead to a shorter acquisition time line and a less expensive overall acquisition. The NDI approach is not without risk, however, as the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase permits a more detailed examination of candidate systems, which can help identify and address requirement shortfalls earlier in the acquisition process (a less expensive solution as opposed to identifying and correcting problems later in a system's development). In all cases, a full and open competition is expected for all three vehicles. In June 2018, the Army established the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program to replace the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV), which has been in service since the early 1980s. In October 2018, Army leadership reportedly decided to add additional vehicle programs to what would be called the NGCV Program. Under the new NGCV Program, the following systems are planned for development: The Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV): the M-2 Bradley IFV replacement. The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV): the M-113 vehicle replacement. Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF). Robotic Combat Vehicles (RCVs): three versions—Light, Medium, and Heavy. The Decisive Lethality Platform (DLP): the M-1 Abrams tank replacement. Previously, the MPF program was overseen by the Program Executive Office (PEO) Ground Combat Systems, but the NGCV program is overseen by the recently established Army Futures Command (AFC) NGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT). MPF will continue to be overseen by PEO Ground Combat Systems, but the NGCV CFT will determine operational requirements and acquisition schedule. In March 2015, the Army changed the name of its Ultra-Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV) to the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV). The overall GMV Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) was 2,065 vehicles for the Army and 317 vehicles for U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). The specific near-term requirement is 295 vehicles for the five Airborne IBCTs and 317 vehicles for USASOC. The Army's FY2018 budget request modified the Army's original acquisition strategy for the GMV, essentially splitting it into two phases. In the first phase, the Army planned to procure GMVs for the five Airborne IBCTs through a U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) contract already in place for a similar vehicle (GMV 1.1) for USSOCOM forces. In this case, the Army planned to purchase the Flyer 72 vehicle from General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems. The Army contended that the limited buy of 295 GMV 1.1 vehicles for the five Airborne IBCTs was the quickest way to field this interim capability that has gone through USSOCOM-sponsored testing and shares the same repair parts, thereby reducing costs. The second phase of the GMV program would be to acquire 1,700 GMVs through a full and open competition once the Army has refined its requirements, which was intended to reduce the overall cost. Army officials noted the GMV 1.1 procurement cost will be higher, however, than the cost of the GMVs procured through full and open competition. The Army planned to spend $194.8 million for 718 vehicles from FY2018 to FY2022, with an expectation that a contract award would be made in FY2020. To equip other types of IBCTs, the Army established the Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) program. The ISV is planned to be a larger competitive program than the GMV program and is to have similar operational requirements as the GMV. ISV is planned to be fielded to Active and Reserve Components. The estimated total requirement is for 2,065 vehicles, with projected target production quantities for the next five fiscal years as follows: FY2020: 17 vehicles. FY2021: 118 vehicles. FY2022: 177 vehicles. FY2023: 177 vehicles. FY2024: 162 vehicles. The targeted ISV program acquisition timeline is as follows: Draft Request for Proposal (RFP): March 29, 2019. Industry Day: April 11, 2019. Final RFP Release: April 18, 2019. Prototype Contract Awards (up to three vendors): August 20, 2019. Prototype Vehicle Delivery (two vehicles up to three vendors): November 1, 2019. Production Contract Award: March 31, 2020. Army officials were planning to use the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) to serve as the LRV on an interim basis. From a programmatic perspective, the Army refered to its interim LRV solution as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle-Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV). The JLTV, which is currently in production, could be equipped with additional firepower and sensors to serve in this role while the Army continues to refine its requirements for the LRV. The standard JLTV—at around 18,000 pounds and carrying only four soldiers—does not meet the Army's weight and crew requirements for the LRV as currently envisioned. The Army planned for the LRV to be fielded in IBCT Cavalry Squadrons and Infantry Battalion Scout Platoons. The Army's decision to not request funds for JLTV - RV in its FY2020 budget request calls into question the future of this effort. In October 2016 the Army began its Analysis of Alternatives for MPF candidates. MPF would also be a modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI) platform. The Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase is planned to begin in FY2019 and last through FY2022, with an anticipated Milestone C—beginning of Production and Deployment—by FY2022. Reports suggested the Army had a requirement for about 500 MPF vehicles with an average unit manufacturing cost of $6 million to $7 million per vehicle, which suggests a total program cost of approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The Marine Corps is reportedly monitoring MPF development for possible use in its Marine tank battalions, which could raise the overall MPF procurement to around 600 vehicles. On November 17, 2017, the Army released a request for proposal (RFP) for MPF. The RFP reportedly noted the Army wished to procure 504 MPF vehicles at a unit manufacturing cost target of $6.4 million per vehicle. In December 2018, the Army reportedly awarded contracts to BAE Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to build MPF prototypes. Both companies were reportedly awarded contracts not to exceed $376 million to build 12 prototypes for testing before one company is selected to deliver up to 28 low-rate initial production (LRIP) vehicles. BAE was said to have proposed a modified version of the Army's old M-8 Armored Gun System, and GDLS integrated an M-1 Abrams turret onto the British Ajax Scout Vehicle hull into what is called the Griffin III. The FY2020 Army GMV budget request for $37 million in procurement funding supports the procurement of 69 GMVs for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and 15 ISVs for the Army. The FY2020 GMV Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) request is for $3 million to support operational testing. The Army did not submit a FY2020 budget request for the LRV program. From a programmatic perspective, the Army refers to its interim LRV solution as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle-Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV). The FY2020 Army MPF budget request for $310.152 million in RDT&E funding supports the continuation of rapid prototyping efforts and the completion of 24 prototypes. As previously noted, the Army did not submit a FY2020 budget request for LRV funding. Absent any formal announcement, it is unknown if the Army has decided to cancel this effort, initiate a new effort, or if it is putting this effort on hold to free up funding for other priorities. Another potential issue is if this effort has been cancelled, how the Army will address the operational need for reconnaissance in the IBCTs that the LRV was intended to satisfy. As previously noted, in February 2017 the Army announced it would establish six Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs)—five in the Active Component and one in the Army National Guard (ARNG). While not combat brigades per se, the Army plans for SFABs to be expanded, if the need arises, into fully operational ABCTs or IBCTs capable of conducting major combat operations. If the Army plans to expand some of its SFABs into IBCTs it could have an impact on the number of ISVs, LRVs, and MPF systems needed to fully equip these units. While these numbers would likely be modest, it might be of interest to Congress to know how many additional vehicles would be required. Since they would not be part of the SFAB's organic equipment and only needed in the event of Army expansion, how and when will these vehicles be procured and how will they be maintained so that they would be available when needed? Apart from fielding GMVs to Airborne IBCTs, little is known about the Army's overall fielding plan for these vehicles. Would active IBCTs receive these vehicles first, followed by National Guard IBCTs, or would both components receive the vehicles concurrently? When would these vehicles begin arriving at units, and when is the overall fielding anticipated to conclude? Does the Army plan to field these vehicles to prepositioned stocks in addition to units? What are some of the challenges associated with fielding three different vehicles with different production and delivery dates? ", "answers": ["Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) constitute the Army's \"light\" ground forces and are an important part of the nation's ability to project forces overseas. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as current thinking by Army leadership as to where and how future conflicts would be fought, suggest IBCTs are limited operationally by their lack of assigned transport and reconnaissance vehicles as well as firepower against hardened targets and armored vehicles. There are three types of IBCTs: Light, Airborne, and Air Assault. Light IBCTs are primarily foot-mobile forces. Light IBCTs can move by foot, by vehicle, or by air (either air landed or by helicopter). Airborne IBCTs are specially trained and equipped to conduct parachute assaults. Air Assault IBCTs are specially trained and equipped to conduct helicopter assaults.

IBCTs lack the support of a mobile protected firepower capability to apply immediate, lethal, long-range direct fires in the engagement of hardened enemy bunkers, light armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel in machine gun and sniper positions; with all-terrain mobility and scalable armor protection; capable of conducting operations in all environments. To address these limitations, the Army is undertaking three programs: the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)/Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), formerly known as the Ultra-Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV); the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV); and the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) programs. These programs would be based on vehicles that are commercially available. This approach serves to reduce costs and the time it takes to field combat vehicles. The GMV/ISV is intended to provide mobility to the rifle squad and company. The LRV would provide protection to the moving force by means of scouts, sensors, and a variety of medium-caliber weapons, and the MPF would offer the IBCT the capability to engage and destroy fortifications, bunkers, buildings, and light-to-medium armored vehicles more effectively. The FY2020 Army GMV budget request for $37 million in procurement funding supports the procurement of 69 GMVs for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and 15 ISVs for the Army. The FY2020 GMV Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) request is for $3 million to support operational testing. The Army did not submit a FY2020 budget request for the LRV program. The FY2020 Army MPF budget request for $310.152 million in RDT&E funding supports the continuation of rapid prototyping efforts and the completion of 24 prototypes. Potential issues for Congress include the future of the LRV effort; Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs) and GMV/ISV, LRV, and MPF requirements; and GMV/ISV, LRV, and MPF fielding plans."], "length": 3948, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4f5ecfa493399d3d05b461bf13424dd8257125036b3f0f0e"}
{"input": "", "context": "In our September 2014 report, we found that DHS and GSA planning for the DHS headquarters consolidation did not fully conform with leading capital decision-making practices intended to help agencies effectively plan and procure assets. Specifically, we found that DHS and GSA had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs, identified capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives that would help officials adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and address funding issues as reflected in leading practices. At that time, DHS and GSA officials reported that they had taken some initial actions that may facilitate consolidation planning in a manner consistent with leading practices. For example, DHS had an overall goal of reducing the square footage allotted per employee across the department in accordance with workplace standards, such as standards for telework and hoteling. As we reported in 2014, DHS and GSA officials acknowledged that new workplace standards could create a number of new development options to consider, as the new standards would allow for more staff to occupy the space at St. Elizabeths than previously anticipated. DHS and GSA officials also reported at that time that analyzing different leasing options could affect consolidation efforts. However, we found that the consolidation plans, which were finalized between 2006 and 2009, had not been updated to reflect these actions. In addition, we found in September 2014 that funding for the St. Elizabeths project had not aligned with what DHS and GSA initially planned. We reported that according to DHS and GSA officials, the funding gap between what DHS and GSA requested and what was received from fiscal years 2009 through 2014, was over $1.6 billion. According to these officials, this gap created cost escalations of over $1 billion and schedule delays of over 10 years relative to original estimates. We found in 2014 that these delays posed challenges for DHS in terms of its leasing portfolio. Specifically, DHS’s long-term leasing portfolio was developed based on the original expected completion date for St. Elizabeths development in 2016. In 2014, DHS and GSA reported that they had begun to work together to consider changes to the DHS headquarters consolidation plans, but they had not announced when new plans would be issued. Furthermore, because final documentation of agency deliberations or analyses had not yet been developed, it was unclear if any new plans would be informed by an updated comprehensive needs assessment and capability gap analysis as called for by leading capital decision-making practices. Therefore, in our September 2014 report we recommended that DHS and GSA conduct various assessments and analyses and use the results to inform updated DHS headquarters consolidation plans. DHS and GSA concurred with this recommendation and stated that their forthcoming draft St. Elizabeths Enhanced Consolidation Plan would contain these analyses. As of April 2018, however, the agencies had not submitted updated plan information to Congress that would either meet the requirements of the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act or address our recommendation. According to DHS officials, the agencies prepared a comprehensive response to the Act, including updated analyses, but the information is no longer current and now needs to be revised and revalidated before it is submitted to Congress. Officials told us that the updated consolidation plans and analyses assumed that the project would receive more funding in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 than was appropriated. Further, officials told us that the current Administration is expected to provide input on the planned DHS component occupancies at the St. Elizabeths campus. We continue to believe that DHS and GSA attention to following leading capital decision-making practices—including having a consolidation plan that justifies future actions—is critical given the project’s multi-billion dollar cost and impact on departmental operations. In our September 2014 report, we found that DHS and GSA cost and schedule estimates for the headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths did not conform or only minimally or partially conformed with leading estimating practices, and were therefore unreliable. Furthermore, we found that in some areas, the cost and schedule estimates did not fully conform with GSA guidance relevant to developing estimates. In 2014, we found that DHS and GSA cost estimates for the headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths did not reflect leading practices, which rendered the estimates unreliable. For example, we found that the 2013 cost estimate—the most recent available at the time of our 2014 report—did not include (1) a life-cycle cost analysis of the project, including the cost of repair, operations, and maintenance; (2) was not regularly updated to reflect significant changes to the program including actual costs; and (3) did not include an independent estimate to determine whether other estimating methods produce similar results. In addition, a sensitivity and a risk and uncertainty analysis had not been performed to assess the reasonableness of the cost estimate. We have previously reported that a reliable cost estimate is critical to the success of any program. Specifically, we have found that such an estimate provides the basis for informed investment decision making, realistic budget formulation and program resourcing, meaningful progress measurement, proactive course correction when warranted, and accountability for results. Accordingly, in 2014, we concluded that DHS and GSA would benefit from maintaining current and well-documented estimates of project costs at St. Elizabeths—even if project funding is not fully secured. In 2014, we also found that the 2008 and 2013 schedule estimates (the estimates available at the time of our review) did not include all activities for both the government and its contractors necessary to accomplish the project’s objectives and did not include schedule baseline documents to help measure performance as reflected in leading practices and GSA guidance. For the 2008 schedule estimate, we found that resources (such as labor, materials, and equipment) were not accounted for and a risk assessment had not been conducted to predict a level of confidence in the project’s completion date. In addition, we found the 2013 schedule estimate was unreliable because, among other things, it was incomplete in that it did not provide details needed to understand the sequence of events, including work to be performed in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. In 2014, we concluded that developing cost and schedule estimates consistent with leading practices could promote greater transparency and provide decision makers needed information about the St. Elizabeths project and the larger DHS headquarters consolidation effort. However, in commenting on our analysis of St. Elizabeths cost and schedule estimates, DHS and GSA officials said that it would be difficult or impossible to create reliable estimates that encompass the scope of the entire St. Elizabeths project. In response to our findings, officials said that given the complex, multiphase nature of the overall development effort, specific estimates are created for smaller individual projects, but not for the campus project as a whole. Therefore, in their view, leading estimating practices and GSA guidance cannot reasonably be applied to the high-level projections developed for the total cost and completion date of the entire St. Elizabeths project. GSA stated that the higher-level, milestone schedule currently being used to manage the program was more flexible than the detailed schedule we proposed, and had proven effective even with the highly variable funding provided for the project. However, our September 2014 review found this high-level schedule was not sufficiently defined to effectively manage the program. For example, our review showed that the schedule did not contain detailed schedule activities that included all government, contractor, and applicable subcontractor efforts. In our 2014 report, we recognized the challenges of developing reliable cost and schedule estimates for a large-scale, multiphase project like St. Elizabeths, particularly given its unstable funding history and agreed that incorporating cost- and schedule- estimating leading practices could involve additional costs. However, we also concluded that unless DHS and GSA invest in these practices, Congress risked making funding decisions and DHS and GSA management risked making resource allocation decisions without the benefit that a robust analysis of levels of risk, uncertainty, and confidence provides. Therefore, in our September 2014 report we recommended that DHS and GSA develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the remaining portions of the consolidation project in accordance with leading practices. DHS and GSA concurred with the recommendation. As of April 2018, however, the agencies had not submitted revised cost and schedule information to Congress that would either meet the requirements of the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act or address our recommendation. GSA is leading efforts to revise the project’s cost and schedule estimates, and according to GSA officials, the revised figures will take into account leading cost- and schedule- estimation practices, including a risk assessment. We continue to believe that creating up-to-date, reliable cost and schedule estimates for DHS headquarters consolidation should be an integral part of DHS and GSA efforts to reassess the project. Without this information, it will be more difficult for agency officials and Members of Congress to make informed decisions regarding resource allocations and compare competing funding priorities. In our September 2014 report, we also found that DHS had not consistently applied its major acquisition guidance for reviewing and approving the headquarters consolidation project. Specifically, we found that DHS had guidelines in place to provide senior management the opportunity to review and approve its major projects, but DHS had not consistently applied these guidelines to its efforts to work with GSA to plan and implement headquarters consolidation. Part of the inconsistency was the result of DHS designating the headquarters consolidation project as a major acquisition in some years but not in others. For example, we found that in 2010 and 2011, DHS identified the headquarters consolidation project as a major acquisition and included the project on DHS’s Major Acquisitions Oversight List. Thus, the project was subject to the oversight and management policies and procedures established in DHS major acquisition guidance; however, the project did not comply with major acquisition requirements as outlined by DHS guidelines. For example, we found that the project had not produced any of the required key acquisition documents requiring department-level approval, such as life-cycle cost estimates and an acquisition program baseline, among others. As we reported in 2014, in 2012, the project as a whole was dropped from the list. Subsequently, in 2013 and 2014, DHS included the information technology (IT) acquisition portion of the project on the list, but not the entire project. DHS officials explained that they considered the St. Elizabeths project to be more of a GSA acquisition rather than a DHS acquisition because GSA owns the site and the majority of the building construction is funded through GSA appropriations. In our 2014 report, we recognized that GSA had responsibility for managing contracts associated with the headquarters consolidation project. However, we also noted that a variety of factors, including the overall cost, scope, and visibility of the project, as well as the overall importance of the project in the context of DHS’s mission, made the consolidation project a viable candidate for consideration as a major DHS acquisition. By not consistently applying this review process to headquarters consolidation, we concluded that DHS management risked losing insight into the progress of the St. Elizabeths project, as well as how the project fits in with its overall acquisitions portfolio. Thus, in our September 2014 report we recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security designate the headquarters consolidation program a major acquisition and apply DHS acquisition policy requirements. DHS concurred with the recommendation. As of April 2018, DHS has made some progress implementing this recommendation. For example, on September 16, 2014, DHS issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum designating the DHS-funded portions of the headquarters consolidation program as a Major Acquisition Program to be overseen by the departmental Acquisition Review Board (ARB). DHS also made progress implementing this recommendation by conducting and documenting an ARB of the program in November 2016. The ARB process provided DHS greater oversight of headquarters consolidation, and provided a forum for officials to consider a wide range of issues affecting consolidation efforts, such as funding and project scope. In addition, in January 2018, DHS officials reported that they were working to align headquarters consolidation program documentation to meet the spirit of DHS acquisition policy guidance. We will reassess the status of this recommendation after the consolidation plan and cost and schedule estimates are updated and submitted to Congress per the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act. At that time, we believe there will be more certainty about the future direction of the project overall, and DHS’s funded portion in particular, and we will be better able to assess the level of DHS acquisitions oversight for the project.

The consolidation is to include the development of multi-billion dollar headquarters facilities at the St. Elizabeths campus in Washington, D.C. In September 2014, GAO issued a report entitled: Federal Real Property: DHS and GSA Need to Strengthen the Management of DHS Headquarters Consolidation (GAO-14-648). This statement summarizes the key findings and recommendations from this report, and provides a status update as of April 2018 on DHS and GSA implementation of GAO's recommendations. To complete the September 2014 report, GAO compared DHS and GSA capital planning efforts against applicable leading practices, interviewed officials, and reviewed cost and schedule estimates for the St. Elizabeths project. To assess subsequent DHS and GSA actions to implement GAO's September 2014 recommendations, GAO conducted periodic follow-up with agency officials. In its September 2014 report, GAO found that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and General Services Administration (GSA) planning for the DHS headquarters consolidation at the St. Elizabeths campus in Washington, D.C. did not fully conform with leading capital decision-making practices intended to help agencies effectively plan and procure assets. Specifically, GAO found that DHS and GSA had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs, identified capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives that would help officials adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and address funding issues as reflected in leading practices.

The DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015, enacted in April 2016 would, according to the accompanying Senate committee report, ensure that DHS and GSA fully address the recommendations from GAO's September 2014 report and provide Congress the information needed to make sound decisions regarding the project. Among other things, the Act required DHS, in coordination with GSA, to submit information to Congress, including various assessments and updated cost and schedule estimates related to the DHS headquarters consolidation. As of April 2018, however, DHS and GSA had not submitted the information to Congress that would either meet the requirements of the Act or address GAO's recommendations. DHS and GSA officials cited funding instability as one challenge to updating consolidation plans and cost and schedule estimates.

{"input": "", "context": "On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 into law ( P.L. 115-123 ). Subtitle B of Title IV provided for the creation of a Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. The creation of this committee echoed a number of special panels created by Congress in the past in order to study and make recommendations on various issues unconstrained by existing committee jurisdictions. Prior examples include committees tasked with studying a wide spectrum of issues, including both budget process—such as the Joint Committee to Study Budget Control (created by P.L. 92-599)—and other topics, such as the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (also known as the Church Committee after its chairman, Senator Frank Church, created by S.Res. 2 , 94 th Congress). The act directed the joint select committee to \"provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly reform the budget and appropriations process.\" The act required that the committee be composed of 16 members, with 4 members appointed by each of the Speaker of the House, the minority leader of the House, the majority leader of the Senate, and the minority leader of the Senate. Members were appointed to serve for the life of the committee, with any vacancy to be filled within 14 calendar days. The act further stated that the committee would be led by cochairs. One cochair was to be appointed jointly by the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate, with the other cochair to be appointed jointly by the House and Senate minority leaders. The four members of the joint select committee appointed by then-Speaker Paul Ryan were House Budget Committee Chairman Steve Womack (who served as committee cochair), House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, and Representatives Rob Woodall and Jodey Arrington. The four members appointed by then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi were House Appropriations Committee ranking member Nita M. Lowey (who served as committee cochair), House Budget Committee ranking member John Yarmuth, and Representatives Lucille Roybal-Allard and Derek Kilmer. The four members appointed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were Senators Roy Blunt, David Perdue, James Lankford, and Joni Ernst. The four members appointed by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer were Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Michael Bennet, Brian Schatz, and Mazie Hirono. Under the act, the joint select committee terminated on December 31, 2018. Federal agencies (including legislative branch agencies) were tasked with providing technical assistance to the committee if requested in writing by the cochairs, and employees of the legislative branch could be detailed to the committee on a nonreimbursable basis consistent with the rules and regulations of the Senate. The act provided an authorization for use of not more than $500,000 from the appropriations account for ''Expenses of Inquiries and Investigations'' of the Senate with such sums to be disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, in accordance with Senate rules and procedures, upon vouchers signed by the joint panel's cochairs. The committee was required to hold its first meeting not later than 30 calendar days after the date of enactment, with the cochairs of the committee required to provide an agenda to committee members at least 48 hours in advance of any meeting. The initial organizing meeting was held on March 7, 2018, with additional working group meetings held on August 22, September 13, and September 26, 2018, and a markup held on November 15, 27, and 29, 2018. The committee was also authorized and expected to hold hearings and take testimony from witnesses. Each cochair was entitled to select an equal number of witnesses for each hearing. Witnesses appearing before the committee were required to file a written statement of proposed testimony at least two calendar days before his or her appearance. The law specified that nine members of the committee would constitute a quorum for purposes of voting and meeting, and five members of the committee would constitute a quorum for holding hearings. The act stated that the committee provide recommendations and legislative language to significantly reform the budget and appropriations process. The committee was required to vote by November 30, 2018, on (1) a report containing a detailed statement of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the committee and (2) proposed legislative language to carry out those recommendations. The text of any report and proposed legislative language were required to be made publicly available in electronic form at least 24 hours prior to its consideration by the joint select committee. The act required the report and the proposed legislative language to be approved by a majority of each of (1) the committee members appointed by the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate and (2) the committee members appointed by the House and Senate minority leaders. The law specified that nine members of the committee would constitute a quorum for purposes of voting, with no proxy voting permitted. If the committee voted to report recommendations and legislative language, members were to be allowed the opportunity to file supplemental, minority, or additional views to be included in a committee report. Under the act, if the committee had approved a report and legislative language, it would have been required to make them available to the public \"promptly\" and submit them to the President, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the majority and minority leaders of each chamber within 15 calendar days of approval. Upon receipt of proposed legislative language, the Senate majority leader (or his designee) was required to introduce it in the Senate (by request) on the next day on which the Senate was in session. There were no provisions in the law concerning the introduction of the recommendations of the joint select committee in the House. The Bipartisan Budget Act established certain unique procedures for Senate consideration of any legislative language reported by the joint select committee. These procedures were intended to allow the Senate to reach a timely vote on the question of whether or not to consider legislation embodying the recommendations of the joint select committee, but the act did not specify any procedures governing consideration of the bill once the Senate agreed to take it up. There were no provisions in the act concerning the consideration of the recommendations of the joint select committee in the House. There were also no provisions concerning resolving any differences between the House and Senate or the consideration of a veto message from the President. Such actions would have occurred under the regular procedures of each chamber. Once any recommendations of the joint select committee were introduced in the Senate, the bill would be referred to the Senate Committee on the Budget, which was required to report the bill favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation within seven session days—but without any revisions. If the Budget Committee failed to report the bill within that period, it would be automatically discharged from consideration of the bill, and the bill would be placed on the Senate Calendar of Business. Not later than two days of Senate session after a joint committee bill was reported or discharged from the Budget Committee, the majority leader (or his designee) could move to proceed to consider it. Should the majority leader (or his designee) not make such a motion within two session days, any Senator could do so. The motion to consider a joint committee bill—and all debatable motions and appeals in connection with the motion—would be considered for a maximum of 10 hours, evenly divided between the majority leader and the minority leader (or their designees). A nondebatable motion to further limit debate would be in order and would require a vote of three-fifths of all Senators—60 votes if there is not more than one vacancy—to pass. In order for the recommendations of the joint select committee to be considered by the full Senate, the act required that the motion to proceed be agreed to by a vote of three-fifths of all Senators—60 votes if there is not more than one vacancy. The act further specified that all points of order against the motion to proceed are waived and that a motion to postpone the motion to proceed or a motion to reconsider a vote on it are not in order. Finally, the act directed that not later than the last day of the 115 th Congress (2017-2018), the Senate must vote on a motion to proceed to a bill containing recommendations of the joint select committee. If the Senate approved the motion to proceed, the joint committee bill could then be considered under the regular rules of the Senate, meaning that it would be fully debatable and fully amendable (possibly including by nongermane amendments) and that cloture might need to be invoked on one or more questions (requiring the support of three-fifths of all Senators) in order to reach a final vote. The joint select committee held five days of public hearings. April 17: current challenges facing the budget and appropriations process in Congress and possibilities for improvement; May 9: challenges of the current procedural framework, particularly as it relates to the ability of Members to work effectively and in a bipartisan manner regardless of political dynamics; May 24: the role of the budget resolution and possible options to bolster its impact and influence on subsequent budgetary actions; June 27: testimony heard from 27 Members of the House and Senate (and written statements received from 5 others), including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Hou se Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi; July 17: former Members' historical perspective on enacting budgetary legislation in the context of the challenges presented by both the politics and the framework of the budget and appropriations process. The committee held multiple meetings, both formal and informal, to provide its members a forum to discuss reforms to the budget and appropriations process. These meetings—including working sessions on August 22, September 13, and September 26, 2018—provided the basis for the recommendations that were subsequently incorporated into draft legislation to be considered by the committee as the cochair's mark. The cochair's mark included a recommendation that the budget resolution be adopted for a two-year cycle rather than the current annual cycle. The draft also addressed a number of related concerns, such as allowing reconciliation instructions for both years of a biennium, providing for a revision of the budget resolution in the second session of a Congress to update it for scoring purposes, and revising the requirements concerning the submission and content of the President's budget in the second year of a biennium. The recommendations also provided for a change in the membership of the Senate Budget Committee to be comprised of eight members from the majority and seven members from the minority, including the chairs and ranking members from the Appropriations and Finance Committees, and for the House and Senate Budget Committees to hold a joint hearing on the fiscal state of the nation. On November 15, 2018, the committee began marking up the draft legislation. In that markup, the committee agreed by unanimous consent to apply a voting rule for the adoption of amendments consistent with the rule required by the act for final adoption of any recommendations. This agreement required separate majorities of the appointees from each party. The markup continued on November 27 and 29. The final vote on reporting the draft bill, as amended, was not agreed to by a roll-call vote of one aye and seven noes of the Members appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader and seven ayes and zero noes of the Members appointed by the House minority leader and the Senate minority leader.", "answers": ["The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), signed into law on February 9, 2018, created a joint select committee of the House and Senate.

{"input": "", "context": "Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to \"declare\" a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). The current FMAG system was established by regulation in October of 2001. These grants provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities. This authority has been delegated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Regional Administrators. Once issued, the FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal assistance such as the provision of equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the control, management, and mitigation of any fire on certain public or private forest land or grassland that might become a major disaster. This federal assistance requires a cost-sharing component such that state, local, and tribal governments are responsible for 25% of the expenses. This report discusses the most frequently asked questions received by the Congressional Research Service on FMAGs. It addresses questions regarding how FMAGs are requested, how requests are evaluated using thresholds, and the types of assistance provided under an FMAG declaration. FMAGs can be requested by a state when the governor determines that a fire is burning out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. At that point, a request for assistance can be submitted to FEMA. Typically, requests are submitted to the FEMA Regional Administrator. Requests can be submitted any time—day or night—and can be submitted by telephone to expedite the process. Telephone requests must be followed by written confirmation within 14 days of the phone request. Under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (SRIA, Division B of P.L. 113-2 ), tribes are equivalent to states in their ability to request a major disaster declaration, an emergency declaration, or a request for an FMAG declaration. Note that some tribal land holdings are administered by the federal government and, therefore, receive fire suppression support through the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The NIFC supports interagency \"wildland\" firefighting efforts on federal lands by the U.S. Forest Service, National Weather Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and FEMA's U.S. Fire Administration. Unlike FMAGs, such support generally does not require tribes to reimburse firefighting costs (FMAGs require the state to pay a 25% cost-share). In addition, tribes with their own fire suppression resources may receive reimbursement from BIA for their costs related to fire suppression on tribal lands. The FMAG request should include cost estimates to support the request as well as information about the fire including the size of the fire(s) in acres or square miles, the population of the community (or communities) threatened, the number of persons evacuated (if applicable), weather conditions, and the degree to which state and local resources are committed to this fire and other fires in federal, state, and/or local jurisdictions. The verbal request must be followed up with a completed \"Request for Fire Management Assistance Declaration\" (FEMA form 078-0-1) and the \"Principal Advisor's Report\" (FEMA form 078-0-2). The following criteria are used to evaluate wildfires and make a determination whether to issue an FMAG: the threat to lives and property including critical facilities, infrastructures, and watershed areas; the availability of state and local fire resources; high fire danger conditions based on nationally accepted indices such as the National Fire Danger Ratings System; and the potential economic impacts of the fire. In addition, FEMA has developed fire cost thresholds that are typically updated on an annual basis. There are two types of fire cost thresholds used to help determine if a state or tribal nation is eligible for fire assistance: (1) individual thresholds for a single fire, and (2) cumulative thresholds for multiple fires. Cumulative thresholds are applied to multiple fires burning simultaneously, or the accumulation of multiple fires in a single fire season. Threshold amounts vary by state (see Table 1 ). Taking Pennsylvania as an example, generally, a single fire would need to meet or exceed $927,274 in damages for Pennsylvania to be eligible for an FMAG declaration. In contrast, the formula for the cumulative fire threshold for a given state is one of two amounts—$500,000 or the amount of that state's individual fire threshold multiplied by three, whichever is greater. Returning to the Pennsylvania example, the sum of three individual fire thresholds equals $2,781,822. Since that amount is larger than $500,000, cumulative fire damages in Pennsylvania must meet or exceed $2,781,822 to be eligible for assistance. In contrast, the individual fire threshold for Alaska is $100,000, but the cumulative threshold is $500,000, not the sum of three individual fire thresholds ($300,000). If FEMA denies the request for assistance, the state has one opportunity to appeal the denial. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the date of the denial letter. The appeal should contain any additional information that strengthens the original request for assistance. The Regional Administrator will review the appeal, prepare a recommendation, and forward the appeal package to the FEMA Headquarters Office. The FEMA Headquarters Office will notify the state of its determination in writing within 90 days of receipt of the appeal (or receipt of additional requested information). The state may request a time extension to submit the appeal. The request for an extension must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the date of the denial letter. The request for an extension must include a justification for the need for an extension. The FEMA Headquarters Office will notify the state in writing whether the extension request is granted or denied. No, an emergency or major disaster can be declared after an FMAG declaration has been issued. However, the emergency or major disaster declaration must be initiated by a separate request for assistance by the state or tribal government. FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), the main account FEMA uses to provide disaster assistance. The DRF is a no-year account—unused funds from the previous fiscal year are carried over to the next fiscal year. Funds in the DRF fall into two categories. The first category is for disaster relief costs associated with major disasters under the Stafford Act. This category reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act ( P.L. 112-25 , BCA), which allows appropriations to cover the costs incurred as a result of major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to the discretionary spending limits. The second category is colloquially known as \"base funding.\" Base funding includes activities not tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act. Base funding is scored as discretionary spending that counts against the discretionary spending limits, whereas FMAGs are funded through the DRF's base funding category. The decision to issue a FMAG declaration is not contingent on the DRF balance. Similarly, FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters. When the DRF balance was low in the past, FEMA used its \"immediate needs funding\" (INF) policy until supplemental appropriations were passed to replenish the DRF. Under INF, long-term projects (such as mitigation work) are put on hold and only activities deemed urgent are funded. FMAGs would most likely fall into the category of events with an \"urgent\" need. Under the INF policy, FEMA also delays interagency reimbursements, and recovers funds from previous years in order to stretch its available funds. As with many other Stafford Act disaster assistance grant programs (Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation Grant assistance, Other Needs Assistance) the cost-share for FMAGs is based on a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses. The grantee (the state) and subgrantees (local communities) assume the remaining 25% of eligible costs. Under the FMAG process, FEMA reimburses grantees for eligible activities they have undertaken. The state application for specific grant funds must be submitted within 90 days after the FMAG is granted. That time frame permits the state to gather all information and supporting data on potentially eligible spending to include in their grant application package. The package must also stipulate that the fire cost threshold was met. Following submission of the grant application FEMA has 45 days to approve or deny the application. FMAG assistance is similar in some basic respects to other FEMA assistance. For example, FMAGs will not replicate or displace the work of other federal agencies, nor will FEMA pay straight-time salaries for public safety forces, though it will reimburse overtime expenses for the event. Other eligible expenses can include costs for equipment and supplies (less insurance proceeds); mobilization and demobilization; emergency work (evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control, arson investigation); prepositioning federal, out-of-state, and international resources for up to 21 days when approved by the FEMA Regional Administrator; personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety; field camps and meals in lieu of per diem; and/or the mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on comingled federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another federal agency. Until recently, only major disaster declarations made statewide hazard mitigation grants available. Division D of P.L. 115-254 (Disaster Recovery Reform Act, hereinafter DRRA) amended the Stafford Act to make hazard mitigation available for FMAG declarations as well. Under Section 404 of the Stafford Act as amended by DRRA, mitigation grants from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are provided to states and tribes on a sliding scale based on the percentage of funds spent for FMAG assistance. For states and federally recognized tribes with a FEMA-approved Standard State or Tribal Mitigation Plan, the formula provides for up to 15% of the first $2 billion of estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance, up to 10% for amounts between $2 billion and $10 billion, and 7.5% for amounts between $10 billion and $35.333 billion. FEMA assistance through FMAGs is a direct relationship with the states to assist the state in fighting the fire on state lands. FMAGs are employed so a disaster declaration may not be necessary. The Forest Service and other federal agencies do provide other types of assistance related to wildfire management, such as postfire recovery assistance, or assistance planning and mitigating the potential risk from future wildfires. Most of these programs provide financial and technical assistance to state partners. In addition, other USDA agencies administer various other programs to provide disaster recovery assistance to nonfederal forest landowners, including the Emergency Forest Restoration Program and the Emergency Watershed Program. This depends on the type of assistance being provided by the Forest Service. FMAG assistance is not generally available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service, or any other federal agency engaged in suppression operations. FMAGs provide assistance for suppression operations on nonfederal lands, whereas suppression operations on federal lands are the responsibility of the federal agency with jurisdiction. Limited exceptions may occur for declared fires on lands in which the ownership is comingled federal and nonfederal, and the costs incurred by the eligible entity are not entitled to any other type of federal reimbursement. However, FMAGs may be provided in conjunction with other Forest Service assistance programs, such as any technical and financial assistance provided through the agency's state and volunteer fire assistance programs or state and private forestry office. FMAG and other federal assistance may potentially occur in conjunction when there is a cooperative agreement between federal, state, and other governmental or tribal partners to coordinate emergency wildfire protection and response activities. The cooperative agreement often delineates different geographic areas where the state government is responsible for initial suppression operations, regardless of land ownership, and vice versa, where the federal government may be responsible for providing suppression operations in lands under nonfederal ownership. The cooperative agreements (sometimes referred to as \"fire compacts\") specify how costs are to be apportioned among the partners, including provisions allowing for reimbursement, in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes. In the circumstance where a state (or other eligible entity) conducted suppression operations on federal land and the costs were not reimbursable, an FMAG may potentially be applied for and used to cover eligible costs. No, most fires that begin on federal land are the responsibility of the federal agency that owns or manages the land, and are not eligible to receive FMAG assistance. There are some exceptions, however. For example, FMAGs may be available to assist with declared fires that occur in areas with a mix of federal and nonfederal land, if the state has a responsibility for suppression activities under a cooperative agreement with the applicable federal agency, and those costs are not reimbursable under another federal statute.", "answers": ["Section 420 of the Robert T.

{"input": "", "context": "Social Security, which paid about $989 billion in benefits in 2018, is the largest program in the federal budget in term s of outlays. There are currently about 63 million Social Security beneficiaries. Most Social Security beneficiaries are retired or disabled workers, whose monthly benefits depend on their past earnings, their age, and other factors. Benefits are also paid to workers' dependents and survivors, based on the earnings of the workers upon whose work record they claim. Social Security has a significant impact on beneficiaries, both young and old, in terms of income support and poverty reduction. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035. For both of those reasons, Social Security is of ongoing interest to policymakers. Most proposals to change Social Security outlays would change the benefit computation rules. Evaluating such proposals requires an understanding of how benefits are computed under current law. A person who has a sufficient history of earnings in employment subject to Social Security payroll taxes becomes insured for Social Security, which makes the worker and qualified dependents eligible for benefits. Insured status is based on the number of quart ers of coverage (QCs) earned. In 2019, a worker earns one QC for each $1,360 of earnings, and a worker may earn up to four QCs per calendar year. The amount needed for a QC increases annually by the growth in average earnings in the economy, as measured by Social Security's average wage index. To be eligible for most benefits, workers must be fully insured , which requires one QC for each year elapsed after the worker turns 21 years old, with a minimum of 6 QCs and a maximum of 40 QCs. A worker is first eligible for Social Security retirement benefits at 62, so to be eligible for retirement benefits, a worker must generally have worked for 10 years. Workers are permanently insured when they are fully insured and will not lose fully insured status when they stop working under covered employment, for example, if a worker has the maximum 40 QCs. Benefits may be paid to eligible survivors of workers who were fully insured at the time of death. Some dependents are also eligible if the deceased worker was currently insured , which requires earning 6 QCs in the 13 quarters ending with the quarter of death. To be eligible for disability benefits, workers must also satisfy a recency of work requirement. Workers aged 31 and older must have earned 20 QCs in the 10 years before becoming disabled. Fewer QCs are required for younger workers. In the case of workers having work history in multiple countries, international totalization agreements allow workers who divide their careers between the United States and certain countries to fill gaps in Social Security coverage by combining work credits under each country's system to qualify for benefits under one or both systems. The first step of computing a benefit is determining a worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), a measure of a worker's past earnings. Rather than using the amounts earned in past years directly, the AIME computation process first updates past earnings to account for growth in overall economy-wide earnings. That is done by increasing each year of a worker's taxable earnings after 1950 by the growth in average earnings in the economy, as measured by the national average wage index, from the year of work until two years before eligibility for benefits, which for retired workers is at 62. For example, the Social Security average wage grew from $32,155 in 2000 to $41,674 in 2010. So if a worker earned $20,000 in 2000 and turned 60 in 2010, the indexed wage for 2000 would be $20,000 x ($41,674/$32,155), or $25,921. Earnings from later years—for retired workers, at ages 61 and above—are not indexed. For retired workers, the AIME equals the average of the 35 highest years of indexed earnings, divided by 12 (to change from an annual to a monthly measure). Those years of earnings are known as computation years . If the person worked fewer than 35 years in employment subject to Social Security payroll taxes, the computation includes some years of zero earnings. In the case of workers who die before turning 62 years old, the number of computation years is generally reduced below 35 by the number of years until he or she would have reached 62. For example, the AIME for a worker who died at 61 is based on 34 computation years. For disabled workers, the number of computation years depends primarily on the age at which they become disabled, increasing from 2 years for those aged 24 or younger to 35 years for those aged 62 or older. The next step in determining a benefit is to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA) by applying a benefit formula to the AIME. First, the AIME is sectioned into three brackets (or segments) of earnings, which are divided by dollar amounts known as bend points. In 2019, the bend points are $926 and $5,583. Those amounts are indexed to the national average wage index, so they generally increase each year. Three factors, which are fixed by law at 90%, 32%, and 15%, are applied to the three brackets of AIME. For workers with AIMEs of $926 or less in 2019, the PIA is 90% of the AIME. Because the other two factors are lower, that share declines as AIMEs increase, which makes the benefit formula progressive. For workers who become eligible for retirement benefits, become disabled, or die in 2019, the PIA is determined as shown in the example in Table 1 and in Figure 1 . Benefits are based on covered earnings. Earnings up to the maximum taxable amount ($132,900 in 2019) are subject to the Social Security payroll tax. If a worker earns the maximum taxable earnings in every year of a full work history and becomes eligible in 2019, the maximum PIA is $2,861. In the AIME computation, earnings are indexed to the average wage index, and the bend points in the benefit formula are indexed to growth in the average wage index. As a result, replacement rates—the portion of earnings that benefits replace—remain generally stable. That is, from year to year, the average benefits that new beneficiaries receive increase at approximately the same rate as average earnings in the economy. A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is applied to the benefit beginning in the second year of eligibility, which for retired workers is age 63. The COLA applies even if a worker has not yet begun to receive benefits. The COLA usually equals the growth in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) from the third quarter of one calendar year to the third quarter of the next year. Beneficiaries will receive a COLA of 2.8% for benefits paid in January 2019. The full retirement age (FRA, also called the normal retirement age) is the age at which a worker can receive the full PIA, increased by any COLAs. The FRA was 65 for people born before 1938, but the Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ) raised the FRA for those born later, as shown in Table 2 . Retired workers may claim benefits when they turn 62 years old, but the longer that they wait, the higher their monthly benefit. The higher monthly benefit is intended to offset the fewer number of payments that people who delay claim will receive over their lifetimes, so that the total value of lifetime benefits is approximately the same regardless of when they claim based on average life expectancy. The permanent reduction in monthly benefits that applies to people who claim before the FRA is called an actuarial reduction. It equals 6⅔% per year for the first three years of early claim and 5% for additional years. The permanent increase in monthly benefits that applies to those who claim after the FRA is called the delayed retirement credit. For people born in 1943 and later, that credit is 8% for each year of delayed claim after the FRA, up to age 70. For people with an FRA of 66, therefore, monthly benefits are 75% of the PIA for those who claim benefits at the age of 62 and 132% of the PIA for people who wait until the age of 70 to claim (see Figure 2 ). Because people who claim earlier receive more payments over a lifetime, the overall effect of claiming at different ages depends on how long the beneficiary lives. For example, someone who dies at 71 years old would be better off claiming early, but someone who survives to 95 would be better off claiming late. An increase in the FRA can result in lower benefits in two ways. First, monthly benefits will be different for individuals who have identical work histories and the same age of claiming benefits, but who have different FRAs. For example, someone with an FRA of 66 and who claims at age 62 will receive a monthly benefit equal to 75% of the PIA. For someone with an FRA of 67, claiming at 62 will result in a monthly benefit that is 70% of the PIA. Depending on the claim age, the scheduled increase in the FRA from 66 to 67 will reduce monthly benefits by between 6.1% and 7.7%. Second, lifetime benefits will be different for workers who have identical work histories and identical age of death, but different FRAs. For example, consider two workers who have FRAs of 65 and 67, respectively, both of whom claim at their FRA, and thus receive identical monthly benefits. If both workers die at age 75, the worker with an FRA of 65 will have received monthly benefits for 10 years, compared with the worker with an FRA of 67, who will have received monthly benefits for 8 years. Social Security benefits are payable to the spouse, divorced spouse, or dependent child of a retired or disabled worker and to the widow(er), divorced widow(er), dependent child, or parent of a deceased worker. When dependent beneficiaries also earned worker benefits, they receive the larger of the worker or the dependent benefit. A spouse's base benefit (that is, before any adjustments) equals 50% of the worker's PIA. A widow(er)'s base benefit is 100% of the worker's PIA. The base benefit for children of a retired or disabled worker is 50% of the worker's PIA, and the base benefit for children of deceased workers is 75% of the worker's PIA. Other benefit adjustments apply in certain situations, notably the windfall elimination provision (WEP), which reduces benefits for worker beneficiaries who have pensions from employment that was not subject to Social Security payroll taxes; the government pension offset (GPO), which reduces Social Security spousal benefits paid to people who have pensions from employment that was not subject to Social Security payroll taxes; the retirement earnings test , which results in a withholding of monthly Social Security benefits paid to beneficiaries who are younger than the full retirement age and have earnings above a certain level; and the maximum family benefit , which limits the amount of benefits payable to a family based on a worker's record. In some cases, a portion of Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income tax. Taxation is not a benefit adjustment, but it does affect the net income of beneficiaries. For additional information, see CRS Report RL32552, Social Security: Calculation and History of Taxing Benefits .", "answers": ["Social Security, the largest program in the federal budget (in terms of outlays), provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members as well as to the family members of deceased workers. In 2018, benefit outlays were approximately $989 billion, with roughly 63 million beneficiaries and 176 million workers in Social Security-covered employment. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035. Monthly benefit amounts are determined by federal law. Social Security is of ongoing interest both because of its role in supporting a large portion of the population and because of its long-term financial imbalance, and policymakers have considered numerous proposals to change its benefit computation rules. The Social Security benefits that are paid to worker beneficiaries and to workers' dependents and survivors are based on workers' past earnings. The computation process involves three main steps First, a summarized measure of lifetime earnings is computed. That measure is called the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Second, a benefit formula is applied to the AIME to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA). The benefit formula is progressive. As a result, workers with higher AIMEs receive higher Social Security benefits, but the benefits received by people with lower earnings replace a larger share of past earnings. Third, an adjustment may be made based on the age at which a beneficiary chooses to begin receiving payments. For retired workers who claim benefits at the full retirement age (FRA) and for disabled workers, the monthly benefit equals the PIA. Retired workers who claim earlier receive lower monthly benefits, and those who claim later receive higher benefits. Retired worker benefits can be affected by other adjustments. For example, the windfall elimination provision can reduce benefits for individuals who receive a pension from non-Social Security-covered earnings, and benefits can be withheld under the retirement earnings test if an individual continues to work and earns above a certain amount. Although not an adjustment, Social Security benefits can be subject to income tax, thereby affecting the beneficiary's net income. Benefits for eligible dependents and survivors are based on the worker's PIA. For example, a dependent spouse receives a benefit equal to 50% of the worker's PIA, and a widow(er) receives a benefit equal to 100% of the worker's PIA. Dependent benefits may also be adjusted based on the age at which they are claimed and other factors."], "length": 2326, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a3e31f3e367f2a3c656ff833c4ec78e6560f8d8f2fa4c168"}
{"input": "", "context": "TSA allocates TSOs to airports using its Resource Allocation Plan, which is intended to provide each airport with the optimum number of TSOs needed to screen passengers for threats to aviation security, such as prohibited and other potentially dangerous items. To implement passenger screening and pursue efficient operations, in addition to relying on TSOs, TSA works with officials from airlines and airports, as well as officials from associations that represent airlines and airports. At airports, FSDs and their designees work with individual airport operators and airlines to, among other things, adjust TSA resources (i.e., TSOs and screening assets such as metal detectors) in response to increases in passenger throughput at each checkpoint, and monitor passenger wait times at checkpoints. At TSA headquarters, the Office of Security Operations (OSO) has primary responsibility for operation of the Resource Allocation Plan and allocation of TSOs across airports. To allocate staff to the nearly 440 TSA-regulated airports in the United States, OSO is to use a combination of computer-based modeling and line-item adjustments based on airport- specific information. First, the agency is to work with a contractor to evaluate the assumptions—such as rates of expedited screening—used by the computer-based staffing allocation model to determine the optimal number of TSOs at each airport based on airport size and configuration, flight schedules, and the time it takes to perform checkpoint and baggage screening tasks. Second, after the model has determined how many TSOs are required for each airport, headquarters-level staff are to make line item adjustments to account for factors such as differences in staff availability and training needs that affect each airport. In 2007, we reviewed the Resource Allocation Plan (referred to as the Staffing Allocation Model at that time) and recommended, among other things, that TSA establish a mechanism to ensure periodic assessment of the assumptions, such as passenger and checked baggage screening rates, underlying the plan. TSA agreed with the recommendation, and in December 2007 developed and implemented a plan to periodically assess the plan’s assumptions. At each airport, TSA is to collect throughput data on the number of passengers screened under both expedited and standard screening and monitor passenger wait times at screening checkpoints. TSA airport officials are to submit passenger throughput and wait time data on a daily basis to OSO’s Performance Management Division at TSA headquarters, which compiles the data through the Performance Measurement Information System, TSA’s web-based data collection system. TSA required FSDs and their designees to collect actual wait times from 2002 through 2007 and beginning again in July 2014. From 2008 through June 2014, TSA required that FSDs collect data on wait time ranges, such as between 20 to 29 minutes or greater than 30 minutes. In February 2018, we reported that TSA headquarters officials have taken steps intended to improve information sharing with stakeholders—officials from airlines and airports, as well as officials from associations that represent airlines and airports—about staffing and related screening procedures at airports. For example, we reported that TSA holds daily conference calls with stakeholders at selected airports intended to ensure timely communication and to help identify and address challenges in airport operations such as increases in passenger wait times. Additionally, we reported that TSA conducted a series of presentations and meetings to discuss the Resource Allocation Plan, security enhancements at airports, and airport screening processes, among other things. In February 2018, we reported that TSA collects passenger wait time and throughput data and uses those data to monitor daily operations at airports. TSA’s Operations Directive (directive), Reporting Customer Throughput and Wait Times, provides instructions for collecting and reporting wait time and passenger throughput data for TSA screening lanes. Regarding wait time data, according to the directive, FSDs or their designees at all Category X, I, and II airports must measure wait times every operational hour in all TSA expedited and standard screening lanes. The directive requires wait times to be measured in actual time, using a verifiable system such as wait time cards, closed circuit television monitoring, or another confirmable method. The directive indicates that wait times should be measured from the end of the line in which passengers are waiting to the walk through metal detector or advanced imaging technology units. According to TSA officials at that time, at the beginning of each hour, wait time cards are handed to passengers at the end of the checkpoint line and are collected when a passenger reaches the metal detector or imaging unit. Closed circuit television is monitored from a location other than the checkpoint, such as at the airport’s coordination center. According to TSA headquarters officials, TSA does not require FSDs or their designees to collect wait times from a statistical sample of passengers throughout the hour, but rather requires that one wait time is collected for every operational hour in all screening lanes. If more than one wait time is collected during the hour, the directive indicates that the maximum wait time should be reported. TSA officials at airports we visited for our February 2018 report stated that TSOs return completed wait time cards to supervisors, who then enter the information into a shared spreadsheet and eventually into the Performance Measurement Information System. Each hour’s reported wait time is then applied to all of a lane’s throughput for that given hour. FSDs or their designees at Category III and IV airports may estimate wait times initially, but the directive requires them to measure actual wait times when wait times are estimated at 10 minutes or greater. The directive also requires FSDs or their designees to collect passenger throughput data directly from the walkthrough metal detectors and advanced imaging technology units. According to TSA headquarters officials, the machines have sensors that collect the number of passengers who pass through each hour, and TSOs retrieve the data directly from the units. All airports regardless of category are required to enter their wait time and throughput data daily into the information system no later than 3:30 AM Eastern Time of the next calendar day so that the data can be included in the morning’s Daily Leadership Report (discussed in more detail below). To monitor operations for all airports, TSA compiles a daily report utilizing a variety of data points from the information system, including wait time and throughput data. The Office of Security Operations’ Performance Management Division disseminates the Daily Leadership Report to TSA officials, including regional directors and FSDs and their designees every morning detailing the previous day’s wait times and throughput figures, among other data points. The Performance Management Division includes a quality assurance addendum with each Daily Leadership Report, indicating missing or incorrect data, to include wait time and throughput data, and TSA has procedures in place intended to ensure officials at the airports correct the data in the Performance Measurement Information System within 2 weeks. In addition to the Daily Leadership Report, we reported that TSA utilizes wait time and throughput data to monitor airport operations at 28 airports in near real time. In May 2016, TSA established the Airport Operations Center partly in response to the long screening checkpoint lines in the spring of 2016 at certain airports. The center conducts near real time monitoring of the operations of 28 airports that, according to TSA headquarters officials, represent the majority of passenger throughput nationwide or are operationally significant. TSA requires the 28 airports monitored by the center to enter passenger wait time data and throughput data hourly (whereas the remaining airports are only required to submit data once daily, by 3:30 AM Eastern Time, as described above) so that officials can monitor the operations in near real time. In addition, TSA officials at airports are required to report to the center when an event occurs—such as equipment malfunctions, weather-related events, or unusually high passenger throughput—that affects airport screening operations and results in wait times that are greater than TSA’s standards of 30 minutes in standard screening lanes or greater than 15 minutes in expedited screening lanes. If an airport is undergoing a period of prolonged wait times, we found that officials at the Airport Operations Center reported coordinating with the Regional Director and the FSD to assist in deploying resources. For example, over the course of the summer of 2016, after certain airports experienced long wait times in the spring of 2016 as confirmed by our analysis, the center assisted in deploying additional passenger screening canines and TSOs to those airports that experienced longer wait times. The center disseminates a morning and evening situational report to TSA airport-level officials and airport stakeholders summarizing nationwide wait times, highlighting wait times at the top airports and any hot spots (unexpected passenger volume or other operational challenges) that may have occurred since the most recent report was issued. In addition to the near real-time monitoring of 28 airports, the center also monitors operations at all other airports and disseminates information to airports and stakeholders as needed. For our February 2018 report, to determine the extent to which TSA exceeded its wait time standards, we analyzed wait time data for the 28 airports monitored by the Airport Operations Center for the period of January 2015 through May 2017 for both standard and expedited screening. Our analysis showed that TSA met its wait time standard of less than 30 minutes in standard screening at the 28 airports 99.3 percent of the time for the period of January 2015 through May 2017. For expedited screening for the same time period at the same airports, we found that 100 percent of the time passengers were reported to have waited 19 minutes or less. Additionally, our analysis confirmed that the percentage of passengers in standard screening who waited over 30 minutes increased in 2016 during the months of March, April, and May as compared to 2015 at all 28 airports. Our analysis also confirmed that reported wait times increased in the spring of 2016 at selected airports, as mentioned in the news media. For example, in May 2016, approximately 22 percent of passengers at Chicago O’Hare International airport and 26 percent of passengers at Chicago Midway International airport waited over 30 minutes in standard screening as opposed to zero percent for both airports in May 2015, which accounted for the longest wait times in the spring of 2016. These two airports were part of the 28 airports for which we analyzed wait time data for the period of January 2015 through May 2017. In February 2018, we reported that FSDs and their staff at the airports we visited identified a variety of tools that they utilize to respond to increases in passenger wait times and/or throughput. TSOs from the National Deployment Force —teams of additional TSOs—are available for deployment to airports to support screening operations during major events and seasonal increases in passengers. For example, TSA officials at one airport we visited received National Deployment Force officers during busy holiday seasons and officials at another airport received officers during the increase in wait times in the spring and summer of 2016. TSA officials at selected airports used passenger screening canines to expedite the screening process and support screening operations during increased passenger throughput and wait time periods. For example, TSA officials at one airport we visited emphasized the importance of passenger screening canines as a useful tool to minimize wait times and meet passenger screening demands at times when throughput is high. Officials at another airport we visited relied on these canines in busy terminals during peak periods. According to officials at two of the airports we visited, the use of passenger screening canines helped them to reduce wait times due to increased passenger volumes in the spring and summer of 2016. TSA officials at selected airports also utilize part-time TSOs and overtime hours to accommodate increases in passenger throughput and wait times. For example, according to officials at all eight of the airports we visited, they used overtime during peak travel times, such as holiday travel seasons, and officials usually planned the use of overtime in advance. Additionally, TSA officials at four of the airports we visited told us they used part-time TSOs to help manage peak throughput times throughout the day. According to TSA officials at two of the airports we visited, they moved TSOs between checkpoints to accommodate increases in passenger throughput at certain checkpoints and to expedite screening operations. For example, TSA officials at one airport we visited have a team of TSOs that terminal managers can request on short notice. Officials at the other airport estimated that they move TSOs between terminals about 40 times per day.

TSA allocates TSOs to airports using both a computer-based staffing model and information from airports intended to provide each airport with the optimum number of TSOs. In the spring of 2016, long screening checkpoint lines at certain U.S. airports raised questions about TSA's process for allocating TSOs to airports. This testimony addresses (1) how TSA monitors wait times and throughput, and (2) tools TSA uses to respond to increases in passenger wait times. This testimony is based on a report GAO issued in February, 2018: GAO, Aviation Security: TSA Uses Current Assumptions and Airport-Specific Data for Its Staffing Process and Monitors Passenger Wait Times Using Daily Operations Data . GAO-18-236 , Washington, D.C.: February 1, 2018. For that report, among other things, GAO analyzed TSA documentation and passenger wait time and throughput data. In February 2018, GAO reported that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses data to monitor passenger wait times and throughput, the number of passengers that are screened at each airport checkpoint, on a daily basis and responds to increases. For example, TSA's Airport Operations Center (AOC) monitors daily wait times and passenger throughput from 28 airports that TSA officials say represent the majority of passenger throughput nationwide or are operationally significant. Furthermore, TSA officials at airports are required to report to the AOC when an event occurs--such as equipment malfunctions--that affects airport screening operations and results in wait times that are greater than 30 minutes in standard screening lanes. For its February 2018 report, GAO analyzed wait time data for the AOC-monitored airports for the period of January 2015 through May 2017 and found that TSA's reported wait times met its standard of less than 30 minutes in standard screening 99 percent of the time. Within that time frame, two airports accounted for the longest wait times in the spring of 2016. TSA officials also identified several tools, such as passenger screening canines, that they reported using to respond to increases in passenger wait times at these airports. GAO is not making any recommendations."], "length": 2622, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ac3beec6d8ea16fc38a432eef50ad9d8df9c5b7d3334123f"}
{"input": "", "context": "The total number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer— one indicator of program participation—increased from 113 million meals in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016, or by 32 percent. Although almost half of the total increase in meals served in the summer months was due to increases in lunches, when comparing across each of the meal types, supper and breakfast had the largest percentage increases over the 10-year period, 50 and 48 percent, respectively (see table 1). The increase in SFSP meals over this time period was generally consistent with increases in the number of meals served in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), the largest child nutrition assistance program, during this period. Although states reported the actual number of SFSP meals served to FNS for reimbursement purposes, they estimated the number of children participating in SFSP, and these participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently, impairing FNS’s ability to inform program implementation and facilitate strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. Specifically, state agencies calculated a statewide estimate of children’s participation in the SFSP, referred to as average daily attendance (ADA), using sponsor-reported information on the number of meals served and days of operation in July of each year. However, according to our review of states’ survey responses and FNS documents, states’ methods for calculating ADA have differed from state to state and from year to year. For example, although FNS directed states to include the number of meals served in each site’s primary meal service—which may or may not be lunch—some states calculated ADA using only meals served at lunch. In addition, five states reported in our survey that the method they used to calculate ADA in fiscal year 2016 differed from the one they used previously. While FNS clarified its instructions in May 2017 to help improve the consistency of states’ ADA calculations moving forward, ADA, even if consistently calculated, remained an unreliable estimate of children’s daily participation in SFSP for at least two reasons. First, ADA did not account for existing variation in the number of days that each site serves meals to children. Specifically, because FNS’s instructions indicated that sites’ ADAs were to be combined to provide a statewide ADA estimate, differences in the number of days of meal service at each site were disregarded. As a result, ADA did not reflect the average number of children served SFSP meals daily throughout the month. Second, ADA was an unreliable estimate of children’s participation in SFSP because it did not account for state variation in the month with the greatest number of SFSP meals served. According to FNS officials, the agency instructed states to calculate ADA for July because officials identified this as the month with the largest number of meals served nationwide. However, according to our analysis of nationwide FNS data, in summer 2016, 26 states served more SFSP meals in June or August than in July. Although FNS had taken some steps to identify other data that states collect on the SFSP, at the time of our May 2018 report, FNS had not yet used this information to help improve its estimate of children’s participation in the program. In 2015, FNS published a Request for Information, asking whether states or sponsors collected any SFSP data that were not reported to FNS, and received responses from 15 states. The responses suggested some states collected additional data, such as site-level data, that may allow for an improved estimate of children’s SFSP participation, potentially addressing the issues identified in our analysis. FNS also followed up with several of these states in 2016 and 2017 to explore the feasibility of collecting additional data and improving estimates of children’s SFSP participation. FNS stated in a May 2017 memo to states that it is critical that the agency’s means of estimating children’s participation in the SFSP is as accurate as possible because it helps inform program implementation at the national level and facilitates strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. Yet, at the time of our report, FNS had not taken further action to improve the estimate. In our May 2018 report, we concluded that FNS’s limited understanding of children’s participation in the SFSP impaired its ability to both inform program implementation and facilitate strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. To improve FNS’s estimate of children’s participation in the SFSP, we recommended that FNS focus on addressing, at a minimum, data reliability issues caused by variations in the number of operating days of meal sites and in the months in which states see the greatest number of meals served. FNS generally agreed with this recommendation. Other federal and nonfederal programs that operate solely in the summer, as well as those operating year-round, helped feed low-income children in the summer months. For example, in 2016, FNS data indicated about 26 million meals were served through the NSLP’s Seamless Summer Option, a separate federal program that streamlines administrative requirements for school meal providers serving summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by entities such as faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though the reach of these efforts was limited, according to our state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations at the time of our report. For example, of the 27 states that reported in our survey awareness of the geographic coverage of these nonfederal programs, 11 states indicated that they operated in some portions of the state—the most common state response. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with issues related to meal site availability, children’s participation, and program administration, though federal, state, and local entities had taken steps to improve these areas. For example, a lack of available transportation, low population density, and limited meal sites posed challenges for SFSP implementation in rural areas, according to states we surveyed, selected national organizations, and state and local officials in the three states we visited. In response, state and local entities took steps, such as transporting meals to children by bus, to address these issues—efforts that FNS supported through information sharing and grants. States and SFSP providers also reported challenges with meal site safety, and FNS’s efforts to address this area were limited. Seventeen states reported in our survey that ensuring summer meal sites are in safe locations was moderately to very challenging. Some states and sponsors took steps to help address this issue, and FNS also used its available authorities to grant some states and sponsors flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume summer meals on site, such as when safety at the site is a concern. However, our review of FNS documentation showed FNS had not clearly communicated to all states and sponsors the circumstances it considers when deciding whether to grant this flexibility. These circumstances—described in letters the agency sent to requesting states—generally included verification that violent crime activities occurred within both a 6-block radius of the meal site and 72 hours prior to the meal service. Although FNS officials explained that they reviewed state and sponsor requests for flexibility due to safety concerns on a case-by-case basis, they also acknowledged that the set of circumstances they used to approve state and sponsor requests for flexibility, which we identified in their letters to states, had been used repeatedly. Further, states and sponsors reported challenges obtaining the specific data needed for approval of a site for this type of flexibility, including inconsistent availability of timely data, which hampered some providers’ efforts to ensure safe delivery of meals. We concluded that unless FNS shared information with all states and sponsors on the circumstances it considered when deciding whether to grant flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume summer meals on site, states and sponsors would likely continue to be challenged to use this flexibility, hindering its usefulness in ensuring safe summer meal delivery to children. We therefore recommended that FNS communicate to all SFSP stakeholders the circumstances it considers in approving requests for flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume SFSP meals on-site in areas that have experienced crime and violence, taking into account the feasibility of accessing data needed for approval, to ensure safe delivery of meals to children. FNS generally agreed with this recommendation. We also found that while FNS had issued reports to Congress evaluating some of its demonstration projects, as required under its statutory authorities, the agency had not issued any such reports to Congress specifically on the use of flexibilities with respect to the on-site requirement in areas where safety was a concern. As previously discussed, the agency is required to annually submit certain reports to Congress regarding the use of waivers and evaluations of projects carried out under its demonstration authority. FNS officials told us that they had not evaluated or reported on these flexibilities, in part, because they had limited information on their outcomes. We concluded that without understanding the impact of its use of these flexibilities, neither FNS nor Congress knew whether these flexibilities were helping provide meals to children—the goal of the program. Accordingly, we recommended that FNS evaluate and annually report to Congress, as required by statute, on its use of waivers and demonstration projects to grant states and sponsors flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume SFSP meals on-site in areas experiencing crime or violence, to improve understanding of the use and impact of granting these flexibilities on meeting program goals. FNS generally agreed with this recommendation. Although FNS had established program and policy simplifications to help lessen the administrative burden on sponsors participating in multiple child nutrition programs, challenges in this area persisted, indicating that information had not reached all relevant state agencies. According to officials we spoke with from a national organization involved in summer meals, management of each child nutrition program and the processes related to applications, funding, and oversight were fragmented in many states. For example, in one of the states we visited, a sponsor that provided school meals during the school year told us they had to fill out 60 additional pages of paperwork to provide summer meals, which they described as significant burden. FNS officials told us that some of the duplicative requirements might have been a function of differences in statute, and although FNS provided guidance to states on simplified procedures for sponsors participating in more than one child nutrition program, some states might have chosen not to implement them. We concluded that without further efforts from FNS to disseminate information on current options for streamlining administrative requirements across multiple child nutrition programs, overlapping and duplicative administrative requirements may limit children’s access to meals by discouraging sponsor participation in child nutrition programs. We recommended that FNS disseminate information about the existing streamlining options, and FNS generally agreed with this recommendation.

It addresses (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. For its May 2018 report, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; and surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia. GAO also visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations, and analyzed meal site data from these 3 states. In addition, GAO interviewed USDA, state, and national organization officials, as well as SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016, according to GAO's May 2018 report. GAO noted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directed states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, GAO found that participation estimates had been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directed states to use would continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs helped feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed for its May 2018 report. For example, GAO found that in July 2016, about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allowed school meal providers to serve summer meals, according to USDA data. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with SFSP meal providers and national organizations indicated the reach of such efforts was limited. In GAO's May 2018 report, states and SFSP meal providers reported challenges with issues related to meal sites, participation, and program administration, though USDA, state, and local officials had taken some steps to address these issues. Seventeen states in GAO's survey and several providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites were in safe locations. To address this issue, USDA granted some states and providers flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, GAO found that USDA had not broadly communicated the circumstances it considered when granting this flexibility or reported to Congress on the use of flexibilities with respect to the on-site requirement in areas where safety was a concern, per requirements. As a result, neither USDA nor Congress knew whether these flexibilities were helping provide meals to children and meeting program goals. Further, officials from national and regional organizations GAO interviewed, as well as providers GAO visited, reported challenges related to the administrative burden associated with participating in multiple child nutrition programs. Although USDA had established program and policy simplifications to help lessen related burdens, the persistence of challenges in this area suggested that information had not reached all relevant state agencies, potentially limiting children's access to meals by discouraging provider participation. In its May 2018 report, GAO made four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP, communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery, evaluate and annually report to Congress on its use of waivers and demonstration projects when granting these flexibilities, and disseminate information about existing flexibilities available to streamline administrative requirements for providers participating in multiple child nutrition programs.

{"input": "", "context": "As of January 2018, there were 22 TCS programs authorized across 18 states (see fig. 1). All TCS programs are state programs; there are no federal TCS programs. Decisions about whether to develop and operate a TCS program (and how to structure the program) are completely at the discretion of each state; there is no federal role in establishing these programs. Most TCS programs began within the last 10 years; the first TCS program awarded scholarships in Arizona in 1998 and Florida created the newest program in 2018, according to state program documents and officials. Scholarships are funded through donations from private individuals and businesses, and the financial impact to states from TCS programs primarily occurs through forgone revenue resulting from the associated tax credits. In all 22 programs, state agencies and nonprofit organizations both play a role in administering the programs, with the specific responsibilities varying by program: State departments or agencies responsible for tax administration, education, or both, generally administer these programs. For example, they may approve schools or nonprofit scholarship granting organizations or disseminate program information or guidance to potential donors, scholarship students, or the public. Nonprofit scholarship granting organizations (SGO) are generally responsible for managing some aspects of the donation process— such as collecting donations—as well as awarding scholarships to students. States’ TCS programs often determine student eligibility for scholarships based on household income and use a range of factors to determine scholarship award amounts. Income requirements: Seventeen of the 22 TCS programs have income limits (i.e., the maximum amount of household income a student can have and still be eligible for a scholarship). As shown in figure 2, income limits varied widely among programs, ranging from just under $32,000 to about $136,500 per year for students from a four-person household in SY 2017-2018. For context, we compared these income limits to the 2012- 2016 5-year ACS estimates of state median household income for four- person households. Six of the 17 programs had household income limits in SY 2017-2018 above their state’s median income. This included two programs each in Arizona and Pennsylvania which collectively accounted for about one-third of all TCS scholarships awarded to students in SY 2016-2017, according to state-reported data. Of the 17 programs that have household income limits, 6 also require SGOs to further consider income when selecting scholarship recipients among eligible students. Such requirements include giving preference to scholarship applicants from lower-income households or ensuring that a certain percentage of scholarship recipients come from lower-income households. Of the remaining five TCS programs that do not use income to determine eligibility, three use one or more other types of eligibility criteria, such as whether the student has a disability, and two—Montana’s TCS program and Arizona’s Original Individual Income Tax Credit program—are open to all school-aged residents. TCS programs collected limited information on the household incomes of scholarship recipients. The 11 programs that had income information on recipient families collected and reported it in different ways. For example, the Alabama program requires SGOs to report the total number and amount of scholarships awarded to students qualifying for the federal free and reduced-price lunch program and makes the information publicly available. Arizona makes an annual report publicly available on the state’s four TCS programs, including breakdowns of the number of students receiving scholarships from various income levels. Other eligibility requirements: Some TCS programs’ eligibility criteria for student scholarship recipients include other factors, such as students’ disability status or previous schooling. Specifically, 7 of 22 programs are limited to students with disabilities or allow students with disabilities to qualify for a scholarship even if they do not meet some requirements for students without disabilities. For example, to be eligible for Virginia’s program, all students must have a household income below a certain amount, but that amount is higher for students with disabilities. South Carolina’s program is limited to students with disabilities. In addition, some programs may require students to have previously attended a public school (9 of 22) or live in the attendance area of a public school with performance challenges (5 of 22). See appendix II for more information on the eligibility criteria of TCS programs. TCS programs have different requirements for how students can use their scholarships and different methods for calculating scholarship amounts. More than half of the programs (13 of 22) allow students to use their scholarship money for costs like transportation and books in addition to tuition, whereas the remaining programs (9 of 22) require scholarships funds to be used for tuition only. Four programs allow donors to recommend that their donations fund scholarships for specific students. Average scholarship awards in SY 2016-2017 ranged from $500 to $5,468 per student among the 16 programs that published such information or provided it to us. (See appendix II for more information). Most programs require SGOs to consider one or more factors related to student or school characteristics when determining scholarship award amounts. As shown in table 1, these factors may include the cost of private school tuition or the state funding amounts for public school students, among other factors. See appendix II for more information on program requirements related to scholarship amounts. The extent to which TCS program donations affect the amount that donors owe in state and federal taxes depends on program characteristics—such as the percentage of the donation that the rules of the program allow donors to claim as a state tax credit (referred to in this report as “tax credit percentages”) and limits on donation amounts—along with donors’ financial circumstances. Almost all of the TCS programs (20 of 22) offer tax credits to businesses for income or other types of taxes, while more than half offer tax credits to individuals for their income taxes (13 of 22). More than half of programs (13 of 22) offer tax credits for cash donations only, while the remaining 9 programs also allow for at least one type of “in kind” donation, such as a property donation. Eleven of the 22 programs allow eligible donors (either individuals, businesses, or both) to claim 100 percent of their donations as state tax credits, meaning that, for each dollar donated, the amount of state taxes owed (i.e., the donor’s tax liability) is reduced by a dollar, up to any maximum donation limits set by the program. The other 11 programs offer tax credits of 50 percent to 85 percent of donations (see table 2). For example, Indiana and Oklahoma offer tax credits of 50 percent of the donation value, meaning that donors can reduce their state tax liability by 50 cents for every dollar donated. All but one of the programs prohibit donors from receiving a tax credit greater than their tax liability in a given year, although two thirds of the programs allow donors to carry forward portions of the credits to use in future years. Sixteen of the 22 programs limit the amount of tax credits each donor may claim per year and programs vary in how they structure these limits. The programs that set annual limits for donors generally do so in one or both of the following ways: Dollar amount limits: Thirteen programs limit the dollar amount of TCS program tax credits that donors can claim in a given year. These limits ranged from a maximum tax credit of $150 for either individuals or businesses in Montana’s program, to a maximum tax credit of $1 million for either individuals or businesses in Illinois’ program in CY 2018. Limits based on percentage of tax liability: Four programs limit the amount of the TCS program tax credits a donor can claim to a percentage of the donor’s total income tax liability. These limits ranged from 50 to 90 percent of a donor’s income tax liability in CY 2018. For example, in South Carolina donors could receive a tax credit up to 60 percent of their total income tax liability for the year of the donation. All but three programs specify a maximum total amount, or cap, of TCS program tax credits that may be claimed each year for the program as a whole (see table 3). Programs’ procedures vary if the cap is reached in a given year. For example, in Rhode Island, potential donors may apply for credits on a “first come, first served” basis once the application period starts until all credits are taken. In 2018, all of the credits were claimed on the first day of the application period and a drawing was held to determine who would receive credits among those who applied on that first day. Georgia’s TCS program offers a maximum tax credit percentage of 100 percent when total donations do not exceed the donation cap. However, if total donations exceed the program cap, the allowable tax credit percentage is prorated among donors who apply on the day the program- wide cap on tax credits is reached. Twenty programs published or provided us with information on donation amounts, such as total donations and average donations. Among these programs, total program-wide donation amounts in CY 2016 ranged from $43,865 to $553 million. (See appendix III for more information about donation amounts.) In addition to reducing their state tax liabilities, some individuals who make TCS program donations may also be able to reduce their federal income tax liabilities through the federal tax deduction for charitable contributions. In August 2018, IRS and Treasury published proposed regulations that, if finalized without modification, would change the extent to which individuals who make TCS program donations can reduce their federal tax liability. However, the proposed regulations were not final at the time this report was published and are therefore subject to change. As a result, the information we present below does not address the proposed regulations. Currently, the extent to which individuals may reduce their federal income tax liabilities as a result of their TCS donation depends on their specific circumstances, such as whether they itemize their deductions (versus taking the standard deduction), the federal rates at which their income is taxed, and the amount of federal deductions they take for state and local taxes. More specifically, the effect of a TCS donation on an individual donor’s federal tax liability depends on the following: Itemizing federal deductions and taking the deduction for charitable contributions: Taxpayers benefit from itemizing deductions—such as those for state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions—if they exceed the standard deduction. Taxpayers, including TCS donors, may only claim a federal deduction for charitable contributions if they itemize. Federal tax rate: The reduction in federal taxes owed as a result of the federal deduction for charitable contributions depends on the donor’s applicable federal tax rate. Given the same deduction amount, taxpayers subject to higher tax rates will generally reduce their tax liabilities by larger amounts than taxpayers subject to lower tax rates. Deduction for state and local taxes: When filing federal taxes, taxpayers who itemize may take a deduction for state and local taxes they have paid during the tax year. Beginning in tax year 2018, individual taxpayers may deduct no more than $10,000 in state and local taxes on their federal tax returns. Taxpayers who claim state tax credits for TCS program donations reduce their state tax liability, which may in turn reduce the amount they may deduct on their federal tax return for state and local taxes paid. Interaction between the federal deduction for charitable contributions and the federal deduction for state and local taxes: Generally, if a donor pays $10,000 or less in state and local taxes, the amount of the deduction for charitable contributions may be fully or partially offset (i.e., canceled out) by a decrease in the deduction for state and local taxes paid as a result of the TCS program tax credit. Conversely, taxpayers who pay more than $10,000 in state and local taxes cannot deduct the full amount of state and local taxes they paid. Therefore, the reduced state and local taxes paid as a result of the tax credit generally may not offset the amount of the deduction for charitable contributions for these taxpayers. See figure 3 for a description of how individuals’ TCS program donations could affect their federal tax liabilities. TCS program donations can lead to a range of possible changes to an individual’s state and federal income tax liabilities, including some scenarios where donors could reduce their combined state and federal tax liability by an amount that is greater than the amount of their donation (see for example, Donor A in figure 4). Figure 4 shows four examples of how state and federal income taxes may be reduced for hypothetical individual donors in states with 100 percent and 50 percent tax credit scholarship programs. We provided a draft of this report to Education and IRS for review and comment. While the draft was under review at these agencies, IRS and Treasury issued proposed regulations related to state tax credits and the federal deduction for charitable contributions. We updated the report to include information about these proposed regulations but did not alter our analysis to reflect the proposed regulations because they were not final at the time this report was published and are therefore subject to change. We provided a revised draft to IRS as the revisions directly relate to IRS’s areas of responsibility, and informed Education about our approach to addressing the proposed regulations. IRS did not provide formal comments on the draft report. Education’s comments are reproduced in appendix I. Education also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. In its comments, Education noted that it has no role in developing, operating, or overseeing TCS programs, and provided a variety of comments and observations on the draft report. For example, Education suggested that we add additional details about certain TCS program requirements, such as more information about state tax rules and permissible uses of scholarship funds. We incorporated these comments as appropriate. Education also suggested that we delay publication of this report until the IRS regulations are finalized, as Education thought that the report could be more helpful at that time. GAO policy is to communicate audit and evaluation results in a timely manner to decision makers and others who either requested the work or may need the information to bring about needed changes. Therefore, we are issuing the report as planned. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Education, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

Through these credits, donors may reduce the amount they owe in state taxes by the full or a partial amount of their donation, depending on each program's rules. Designing a TCS program requires that many decisions be made, such as which students will be eligible to receive scholarships and the effect donations will have on donors' state taxes. GAO was asked to review key characteristics of TCS programs. This report examines (1) state TCS programs' policies regarding student eligibility and scholarship awards, and (2) how donating to a TCS program could affect the amount of state and federal taxes owed by donors. For both objectives, GAO reviewed publicly-available documents about student eligibility and tax provisions for all 22 programs authorized as of January 2018 and verified the accuracy of the information with state program officials. GAO did not conduct an independent legal review of state laws and regulations. GAO also interviewed federal officials and reviewed relevant federal guidance and policy documents. In 2018, there were 22 tax credit scholarship (TCS) programs authorized across 18 states, which provide state tax credits for individual and business donations that fund scholarships for students to attend elementary and secondary private schools (see figure). To determine the eligibility of students for these scholarships, most TCS programs use household income and have various approaches to determine scholarship award amounts. Income limits vary widely among programs, ranging from approximately $32,000 to $136,500 per year for students from a four-person household in school year 2017-2018. Programs have different requirements for how students can use their scholarships and different methods for calculating scholarship amounts. More than half of the programs (13 of 22) allow students to use their scholarship money for costs like transportation and books in addition to tuition, whereas the remaining programs (9 of 22) require scholarships funds to be used for tuition only. Average scholarship awards in school year 2016-2017 ranged from $500 to $5,468 per student among the 16 programs that published or provided GAO with such information. The effect of TCS donations on donors' tax liability depends on program characteristics and donors' financial circumstances. Specifically, half of the 22 programs allow eligible donors to claim 100 percent of their donations as state tax credits, meaning that for each dollar donated, state taxes owed are reduced by a dollar, up to any maximum set by the state. The remaining 11 programs allow donors to claim from 50 to 85 percent of their donations as state tax credits. Programs often specify a maximum tax credit that may be claimed each year by a donor, by all donors combined, or both. Individual donors may also reduce their federal tax liabilities through the federal deduction for charitable contributions, depending on their financial circumstances and applicable tax provisions."], "length": 3200, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7e42261546f2eb341113e5be328e6632f031045ae99366fb"}

{"input": "", "context": "Key elements of strategic planning include establishing long-term goals and strategies for how those goals are to be achieved. Specifically for managing Coast Guard acquisitions, we have noted that a long-term plan that includes acquisition implications would enable tradeoffs to be addressed in advance, which leads to better informed choices and makes debate possible before irreversible commitments are made to individual programs. Without this type of plan, decision makers do not have the information they need to better understand and address an agency’s long-term outlook. Similarly, according to the Office of Management and Budget’s capital planning guidance referenced by the Coast Guard’s Major Systems Acquisition Manual, each agency is encouraged to have a plan that justifies its long-term capital asset decisions. This plan should include, among other things, (1) an analysis of the portfolio of assets already owned by the agency and in procurement, (2) the performance gap and capability necessary to bridge the old and new assets, and (3) justification for new acquisitions proposed for funding. In June 2014, we found that the Coast Guard—a component within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—did not have a long-term fleet modernization plan that identified all acquisitions needed to meet mission needs over the next two decades within available resources. Without such a plan, the Coast Guard repeatedly delayed and reduced its capabilities through its annual budget process and did not know the extent to which it could meet mission needs and achieve desired results. We recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build the identified assets. DHS agreed with our recommendation but it has not yet approved a 20-year plan. Further, in July 2018, we found the Coast Guard continues to manage its acquisitions through its annual budget process and the 5-year Capital Investment Plan, which is congressionally mandated and submitted to Congress annually. Coast Guard officials told us the Capital Investment Plan reflects the highest priorities of the department and that trade-off decisions are made as part of the annual budget process. However, the effects of these trade-off decisions, such as which acquisitions would take on more risk so others can be prioritized and adequately funded, are not communicated in the Capital Investment Plan to key decision makers. Over the years, this approach has left the Coast Guard with a bow wave of near-term unfunded acquisitions, negatively affecting recapitalization efforts, and limiting the effectiveness of long-term planning. As a result of this planning process, the Coast Guard has continued to defer planned acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational capability gaps unaddressed that could affect future operations. We recommended that the annual Capital Investment Plans reflect acquisition trade-off decisions and their effects. DHS concurred with this recommendation and plans to include additional information in future Capital Investment Plans to address how trade-off decisions could affect other major acquisition programs. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard plans to implement this recommendation by March 2020. Examples of other fleet modernization plans include the Navy’s annual naval vessel construction plan (also known as the Navy’s long range shipbuilding plan), which reflects the quantity and categories of assets that the Navy needs to buy as well as the total number of assets in operation for each year. While we found in March 2006 that the Navy faced challenges associated with its long range shipbuilding plan, we also observed that such a plan is beneficial in that it lays out a strategic approach for decision making. In October 2016, NOAA—which is within the Department of Commerce—approved a fleet plan that is intended to identify an integrated strategy for long-term recapitalization, including acquisition of up to eight new ships. In March 2017, NOAA indicated that long-term recapitalization of the NOAA fleet requires an annual, stable funding profile on the order of its fiscal year 2016 appropriations—about $80 million. NOAA noted that it will continue to proceed on schedule, as laid out in its fleet plan, or make adjustments based on available funding. Our prior work has repeatedly found that successful acquisition programs start with solid, executable business cases before setting program baselines and committing resources. A sound business case requires balance between the concept selected to satisfy operator requirements and the resources—design knowledge, technologies, funding, and time— needed to transform the concept into a product, such as a ship. At the heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach—we have found that successful shipbuilding programs build on attaining critical levels of knowledge at key points in the shipbuilding process before significant investments are made (see figure 1). We have previously found that key enablers of a good business case include firm, feasible requirements; plans for a stable design; mature technologies; reliable cost estimates; and realistic schedule targets. Without a sound business case, acquisition programs are at risk of experiencing cost growth, schedule delays, and reduced capabilities. In September 2018, we found the Coast Guard did not have this type of sound business case when it established the cost, schedule, and performance baselines for its polar icebreaker program in March 2018. This was primarily due to risks in four key areas: Technology. The Coast Guard intends to use proven technologies for the program, but did not conduct a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies—which include the integrated power plant and azimuthing propulsors— prior to setting baselines. As a result, the Coast Guard does not have full insight into whether these technologies, which we believe are critical technologies and merit such an assessment, are mature. Without a technology readiness assessment, the Coast Guard is potentially underrepresenting technical risk and increasing design risk. Cost. The cost estimate that informed the program’s $9.8 billion cost baseline—which includes lifecycle costs for the acquisition, operations, and maintenance of three polar icebreakers—substantially met our best practices for being comprehensive, well-documented, and accurate, but only partially met best practices for being credible. The cost estimate did not quantify the range of possible costs over the entire life of the program, such as the period of operations and support. As a result, the cost estimate was not fully reliable and may underestimate the total funding needed for the program. Schedule. The Coast Guard’s planned delivery dates of 2023, 2025, and 2026 for the three ships were not informed by a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities, but rather were primarily driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast Guard’s only operating heavy polar icebreaker—the Polar Star— reaches the end of its service life (see figure 2). The Polar Star’s service life is estimated to end between fiscal years 2020 and 2023. This creates a potential heavy polar icebreaker capability gap of about 3 years, if the Polar Star’s service life were to end in 2020 and the lead polar icebreaker were to be delivered by the end of fiscal year 2023 as planned. If the lead ship is delivered later than planned in this scenario, the potential gap could be more than 3 years. The Coast Guard is planning to recapitalize the Polar Star’s key systems starting in 2020 to extend the service life of the ship until the planned delivery of the second polar icebreaker (see figure 3). Further, our analysis of selected lead ships for other shipbuilding programs found the icebreaker program’s estimated construction time of 3 years is optimistic. An unrealistic schedule puts the Coast Guard is at risk of not delivering the icebreakers when promised and the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities could widen. Design. The Coast Guard set program baselines before conducting a preliminary design review—a systems engineering event that is intended to verify that the contractor’s design meets the requirement of the ship specifications and is producible—which puts the program at risk of having an unstable design, thereby increasing the program’s cost and schedule risks. Although the Coast Guard set the program baselines prior to gaining knowledge on the feasibility of the selected shipbuilder’s design, it has expressed a commitment to having a stable design prior to the start of lead ship construction. This is consistent with shipbuilding best practices we identified in 2009. To address these four areas and other risks, we made six recommendations to DHS, Coast Guard, and the Navy in our September 2018 report. DHS concurred with all six recommendations and identified actions it planned to take to address them. In its October 2016 fleet plan, NOAA indicated the need to construct up to eight new ships by 2028 to maintain its capabilities for at-sea requirements. Ensuring a sound business case for each acquisition will be important as NOAA moves forward. Given the Navy’s experience in shipbuilding, agencies have partnered with the Navy to take advantage of its expertise. For example, in April and September 2018, we found examples of how the Coast Guard had leveraged the Navy’s resources and acquisition approaches when acquiring the polar icebreakers, including: Establishing an integrated program office and potentially using funding from both organizations. In 2016, in response to a congressional report, the Navy and the Coast Guard established an integrated program office to acquire the icebreakers for Coast Guard operations. This relationship was officially memorialized through three memorandums in 2017. Given potential plans to fund the polar icebreaker program with both Navy and Coast Guard appropriations, the Navy and the Coast Guard had a memorandum of agreement with a budgeting and financial management appendix. In September 2018, however, we found that the Coast Guard and the Navy interpreted the meaning of “cost overruns” differently in the context of their agreement. We also found that the agreement itself did not address how the Coast Guard and the Navy plan to handle any cost growth stemming from changes to the scope, terms, and conditions of the detail design and construction contract. We recommended that the Coast Guard, in collaboration with the Navy, revise the agreement to clarify and document how cost growth in the polar icebreaker program, including changes in scope, will be addressed between the two organizations. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation and plans to update the agreement by March 2019. Establishing an integrated ship design team. The ship design team includes Coast Guard and Navy technical experts who develop ship specifications based on the polar icebreaker program’s operational requirements document. The ship design team is under the supervision of a Coast Guard ship design manager, who provides all technical oversight for development of the polar icebreaker’s design. Leveraging Navy cost estimating and contracting functions. With input from the integrated program office and ship design team, Navy cost estimators developed the polar icebreaker program’s cost estimate, which informed the program’s cost baselines and affordability constraints. In addition, the Navy plans to award the polar icebreaker’s detail design and construction contract under the Navy’s contracting authority and use a tailored DHS acquisition process. Supplementing the DHS acquisition process with the Navy’s gate review process. Coast Guard and Navy agreed to manage the polar icebreaker program using a tailored acquisition approach that supplements DHS acquisition decision event reviews with additional “gate” reviews that were adopted from Navy’s acquisition processes. The gate reviews allow both Coast Guard and Navy leadership to review and approve key documents before proceeding to the acquisition decision events. Each acquisition decision event is also overseen by acquisition oversight board with members from both the Coast Guard and the Navy (see figure 4). By collaborating with the Navy, the Coast Guard is leveraging the Navy’s experience in ship design, cost estimating, contracting, and other shipbuilding processes. This partnership may allow the Coast Guard to more efficiently manage the polar icebreaker program. In March 2017, NOAA indicated that it had partnered with the Navy through an interagency agreement to leverage the Navy’s acquisition expertise for Auxiliary General Purpose Oceanographic Research Vessels, which will be the basis for a new class of NOAA ships. In April 2018, the Navy released the request for proposal for the preliminary contract design of this new class of ships. When acquiring multiple quantities of a product, agencies generally have several options for contracting mechanisms. Annual contracting, which can be considered the typical method, refers to awarding a contract for one year’s worth of requirements. Annual contracting allows for the use of options for subsequent requirements. Options give the agency the unilateral right to purchase additional supplies or services called for by the contract, or to extend the term of the contract. Besides annual contracting with options, agencies may also be able to choose among other contracting mechanisms—multiyear contracting and “block buy” contracting, which are discussed in more detail below. Multiyear contracting allows agencies to acquire known requirements for up to 5 years under a single contract award, even though the total funds ultimately to be obligated may not be available at the time of contract award. Before DOD and Coast Guard can enter into a multiyear contract, certain criteria must be met. Table 1 provides some of the multiyear contracting requirements for DOD and the Coast Guard. Multiyear contracts are expected to achieve lower unit costs compared to annual contracts through one or more of the following sources: (1) purchase of parts and materials in economic order quantities, (2) improved production processes and efficiencies, (3) better utilized industrial facilities, (4) limited engineering changes due to design stability during the multiyear period, and (5) cost avoidance by reducing the burden of placing and administering annual contracts. Multiyear procurement also offers opportunities to enhance the industrial base by providing contractors a longer and more stable time horizon for planning and investing in production and by attracting subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers. However, multiyear procurement entails certain risks that must be balanced against the potential benefits, such as the increased costs to the government should the multiyear contract be changed or canceled and decreased annual budget flexibility for the program and across an agency’s portfolio of acquisitions. In February 2008, we found that it is difficult to precisely determine the impact of multiyear contracting on procurement costs. For example, for three multiyear procurements (Air Force’s C-17A Globemaster transport, the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter, and the Army’s Apache Longbow helicopter), we identified unit cost growth ranging from 10 to 30 percent compared to original estimates, due to changes in labor and material costs, requirements and funding, and other factors. In some cases, actual costs for the multiyear procurement were higher than original estimates for annual contracts. We noted that we could not determine how cost growth affected the level of savings achieved, if any, because we did not know how an alternative series of annual contracts would have fared. Although programs using annual contracts also have unit cost growth, it is arguably more problematic when using multiyear contracting because of the up-front investments and the government’s exposure to risk over multiple years. Block buy contracting generally refers to special legislative authority that agencies seek on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to purchase more than one year’s worth of requirements, such as purchasing supplies in economic order quantities. Unlike multiyear contracting, block buy contracting does not have permanent statutory criteria and, therefore, can be used in different ways. We have previously analyzed several cases where block buy contracts were considered or used and have not found evidence of savings. For example: In September 2018, we found that for the polar icebreaker program, the Navy gave offerors an opportunity to provide the estimated savings that the government could achieve if it were to take a “block buy” approach in purchasing the ships or purchasing supplies in economic order quantities. The Navy told us that they did not receive any formal responses from industry on potential savings from block buys or economic order quantities. In April 2017, we found that the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship contracts’ block buy approach could affect Congress’s funding flexibility. Specifically, the block buy contracts provided that a failure to fully fund a purchase in a given year would make the contract subject to renegotiation, which provides a disincentive to the Navy or Congress to take any action that might disrupt the program because of the potential for the government to have to pay more for ships. In February 2005, we found that the Navy believed that a block-buy contract contributed to increased material costs for the Virginia class submarine. Under this block-buy contract, subcontracts for submarine materials were for single ships spread over several years. According to the Navy, this type of acquisition approach did not take advantage of bulk-buy savings and incurred the risk that funding will not be available in time to order the material when needed. Based on our prior work, it is important for agencies to consider multiple factors such as estimated savings, the stability of the requirements, quantities required, and potential contract terms and conditions before committing to a contracting mechanism approach. In conclusion, as the Coast Guard and NOAA continue investing taxpayer dollars to modernize their fleets, they could benefit from the lessons learned from prior recapitalization and acquisition efforts. It is important for agencies to develop strategic and comprehensive approaches for managing their respective portfolios so that future requirements and capability gaps can be addressed in a timely manner. For each acquisition within their portfolios, agencies should ensure that they have established a sound business case before committing significant resources. Additionally, leveraging the Navy’s resources and expertise in shipbuilding, such as by establishing integrated teams, could be beneficial by helping agencies be more efficient. Finally, when it comes to contracting mechanisms, factors such as estimated savings and program risks should be assessed before committing to a particular approach.

Ensuring that the Coast Guard and NOAA maintain their ships and address potential capability gaps is vital for protecting national security and scientific interests. This statement summarizes lessons that GAO has identified from its prior reviews of Coast Guard and Navy acquisitions, which can be applied to the Coast Guard's and NOAA's shipbuilding efforts. Specifically, this testimony provides information on, among other things, (1) long-term strategic planning for acquisitions, (2) the need for a sound business case, and (3) the leveraging of the Navy's acquisition resources and shipbuilding expertise. In its prior work, GAO reviewed Coast Guard and Navy programs and interviewed officials. For this testimony, GAO obtained publicly available information on NOAA's ship acquisition efforts. GAO has found that acquisition programs can benefit from long-term strategic planning that identifies how tradeoff decisions would affect the future of the acquisition portfolio. In July 2018, GAO found the Coast Guard continues to manage its acquisitions through its annual budget process and the 5-year Capital Investment Plan. As a result of this planning process, the Coast Guard has continued to defer planned acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational capability gaps unaddressed. Incorporating the use of a long-term strategic plan and additional tradeoff discussion into the Capital Investment Plan could lead to more informed choices before irreversible commitments are made. GAO's prior work has also found that acquisition programs should start with solid business cases before setting program baselines and committing resources. At the heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach—successful shipbuilding programs build on attaining critical levels of knowledge at key points in the shipbuilding process before significant investments are made (see figure). In September 2018, GAO found the Coast Guard did not have this type of sound business case when it established the program baselines for its polar icebreaker program in March 2018 due to risks in technology, design, cost, and schedule. For example, the Coast Guard's planned delivery dates were not informed by a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities, but rather were primarily driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast Guard's only operating heavy polar icebreaker reaches the end of its service life. Agencies have partnered with the Navy to take advantage of its resources and shipbuilding expertise, including the Coast Guard when acquiring the polar icebreakers. For example, in September 2018, GAO found that the Coast Guard and the Navy had established an integrated program office and a ship design team. These teams provided input to Navy cost estimators, who developed the polar icebreaker program's cost estimate. GAO has previously recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan, reflect acquisition trade-off decisions in its annual Capital Investment Plans, and address risks to establish a sound business case for its polar icebreakers acquisition. DHS concurred with these recommendations and is taking steps to implement them."], "length": 3607, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f619938fdfeefc99309ca89ff35bb7d774d4c562c4e25dbe"}
{"input": "", "context": "Our October 2017 report found that CMS provides guidance to Medicare Part D plan sponsors on how the plan sponsors should monitor opioid overutilization problems among Part D beneficiaries. The agency includes this guidance in its annual letters to plan sponsors, known as call letters; it also provided a supplemental memo to plan sponsors in 2012. Among other things, these guidance documents instructed plan sponsors to implement a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system to monitor beneficiary utilization starting in 2013. As part of the DUR systems, CMS requires plan sponsors to have methods to identify beneficiaries who are potentially overusing specific drugs or groups of drugs, including opioids. Also in 2013, CMS created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS), which outlines criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids and to oversee sponsors’ compliance with CMS’s opioid overutilization policy. Plan sponsors may use the OMS criteria for their DUR systems, but they have some flexibility to develop their own targeting criteria within CMS guidance. At the time of our review, the OMS considered beneficiaries to be at a high risk of opioid overuse when they met all three of the following criteria: 1. received a total daily MED greater than 120 mg for 90 consecutive 2. received opioid prescriptions from four or more providers in the previous 12 months, and 3. received opioids from four or more pharmacies in the previous 12 months. The criteria excluded beneficiaries with a cancer diagnosis and those in hospice care, for whom higher doses of opioids may be appropriate. Through the OMS, CMS generates quarterly reports that list beneficiaries who meet all of the criteria and who are identified as high-risk, and then distributes the reports to the plan sponsors. Plan sponsors are expected to review the list of identified beneficiaries, determine appropriate action, and then respond to CMS with information on their actions within 30 days. According to CMS officials, the agency also expects that plan sponsors will share any information with CMS on beneficiaries that they identify through their own DUR systems. We found that some actions plan sponsors may take include Case management. Case management may include an attempt to improve coordination issues, and often involves provider outreach, whereby the plan sponsor will contact the providers associated with the beneficiary to let them know that the beneficiary is receiving high levels of opioids and may be at risk of harm. Beneficiary-specific point-of-sale (POS) edits. Beneficiary-specific POS edits are restrictions that limit these beneficiaries to certain opioids and amounts. Pharmacists receive a message when a beneficiary attempts to fill a prescription that exceeds the limit in place for that beneficiary. Formulary-level POS edits. These edits alert providers who may not have been aware that their patients are receiving high levels of opioids from other doctors. Referrals for investigation. According to the six plan sponsors we interviewed, the referrals can be made to CMS’s National Benefit Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (NBI MEDIC), which is responsible for identifying and investigating potential Part D fraud, waste, and abuse, or to the plan sponsor’s own internal investigative unit, if they have one. After investigating a particular case, they may refer the case to the HHS-OIG or a law enforcement agency, according to CMS, NBI MEDIC, and one plan sponsor. Based on CMS’s use of the OMS and the actions taken by plan sponsors, CMS reported a 61 percent decrease from calendar years 2011 through 2016 in the number of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria of high risk—from 29,404 to 11,594 beneficiaries—which agency officials consider an indication of success toward its goal of decreasing opioid use disorder. In addition, we found that CMS relies on separate patient safety measures developed and maintained by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance to assess how well Part D plan sponsors are monitoring beneficiaries and taking appropriate actions. In 2016, CMS started tracking plan sponsors’ performance on three patient safety measures that are directly related to opioids. The three measures are similar to the OMS criteria in that they identify beneficiaries with high dosages of opioids (120 mg MED), beneficiaries that use opioids from multiple providers and pharmacies, and beneficiaries that do both. However, one difference between these approaches is that the patient safety measures separately identify beneficiaries who fulfill each criterion individually. Our October 2017 report also found that while CMS tracks the total number of beneficiaries who meet all three OMS criteria as part of its opioid overutilization oversight across the Part D program, it does not have comparable information on most beneficiaries who receive high doses of opioids—regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies used—and who therefore may be at risk for harm, according to CDC guidelines. These guidelines note that long-term use of high doses of opioids—those above a MED of 90 mg per day—are associated with significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible. Based on the CDC guidelines, outreach to Part D plan sponsors, and CMS analyses of Part D data, CMS has revised its current OMS criteria to include more at-risk beneficiaries beginning in 2018. The new OMS criteria define a high user as having an average daily MED greater than 90 mg for any duration, and who receives opioids from four or more providers and four or more pharmacies, or from six or more providers regardless of the number of pharmacies, for the prior 6 months. Based on 2015 data, CMS found that 33,223 beneficiaries would have met these revised criteria. While the revised criteria will help identify beneficiaries who CMS determined are at the highest risk of opioid misuse and therefore may need case management by plan sponsors, OMS will not provide information on the total number of Part D beneficiaries who may also be at risk of harm. In developing the revised criteria, CMS conducted a one-time analysis that estimated there were 727,016 beneficiaries with an average MED of 90 mg or more, for any length of time during a 6 month measurement period in 2015, regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies used. These beneficiaries may be at risk of harm from opioids, according to CDC guidelines, and therefore tracking the total number of these beneficiaries over time could help CMS to determine whether it is making progress toward meeting the goals specified in its Opioid Misuse Strategy to reduce the risk of opioid use disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and drug diversion. However, CMS officials told us that the agency does not keep track of the total number of these beneficiaries, and does not have plans to do so as part of OMS. (See fig. 1.) We also found that in 2016, CMS began to gather information from its patient safety measures on the number of beneficiaries who use more than 120 mg MED of opioids for 90 days or longer, regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies. The patient safety measures identified 285,119 such beneficiaries—counted as member-years—in 2016. However, this information does not include all at-risk beneficiaries, because the threshold is more lenient than indicated in CDC guidelines and CMS’s new OMS criteria. Because neither the OMS criteria nor the patient safety measures include all beneficiaries potentially at risk of harm from high opioid doses, we recommended that CMS should gather information over time on the total number of beneficiaries who receive high opioid morphine equivalent doses regardless of the number of pharmacies or providers, as part of assessing progress over time in reaching the agency’s goals related to reducing opioid use. HHS concurred with our recommendation. Our October 2017 report found that CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor, NBI MEDIC, and the Part D plan sponsors. NBI MEDIC’s data analyses to identify outlier providers. CMS requires NBI MEDIC to identify providers who prescribe high amounts of Schedule II drugs, which include but are not limited to opioids. Using prescription drug data, NBI MEDIC conducts a peer comparison of providers’ prescribing practices to identify outlier providers—the highest prescribers of Schedule II drugs. NBI MEDIC reports the results to CMS. NBI MEDIC’s other projects. NBI MEDIC gathers and analyzes data on Medicare Part C and Part D, including projects using the Predictive Learning Analytics Tracking Outcome (PLATO) system. According to NBI MEDIC officials, these PLATO projects seek to identify potential fraud by examining data on provider behaviors. NBI MEDIC’s investigations to identify fraud, waste, and abuse. NBI MEDIC officials conduct investigations to assist CMS in identifying cases of potential fraud, waste, and abuse among providers for Medicare Part C and Part D. The investigations are prompted by complaints from plan sponsors; suspected fraud, waste, or abuse reported to NBI MEDIC’s call center; NBI MEDIC’s analysis of outlier providers; or from one of its other data analysis projects. NBI MEDIC’s referrals. After identifying providers engaged in potential fraudulent overprescribing, NBI MEDIC officials said they may refer cases to law enforcement agencies or the HHS-OIG for further investigation and potential prosecution. Plan sponsors’ monitoring of providers. CMS requires all plan sponsors to adopt and implement an effective compliance program, which must include measures to prevent, detect, and correct Part C or Part D program noncompliance, as well as fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS’s guidance focuses broadly on prescription drugs, and does not specifically address opioids. Our report concluded that although these efforts provide valuable information, CMS lacks all the information necessary to adequately oversee opioid prescribing. CMS’s oversight actions focus broadly on Schedule II drugs rather than specifically on opioids. For example, NBI MEDIC’s analyses to identify outlier providers do not indicate the extent to which they may be overprescribing opioids specifically. According to CMS officials, they direct NBI MEDIC to focus on Schedule II drugs, because these drugs have a high potential for abuse, whether they are opioids or other drugs. However, without specifically identifying opioids in these analyses—or an alternate source of data—CMS lacks data on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and therefore cannot assess progress toward meeting its goals related to reducing opioid use, which would be consistent with federal internal control standards. Federal internal control standards require agencies to conduct monitoring activities and to use quality information to achieve objectives and address risks. As a result, we recommended that CMS require NBI MEDIC to gather separate data on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids. This would allow CMS to better identify those providers who are inappropriately and potentially fraudulently overprescribing opioids. HHS agreed, and noted that it intends to work with NBI MEDIC to identify trends in outlier prescribers of opioids. Our report also found that CMS also lacks key information necessary for oversight of opioid prescribing, because it does not require plan sponsors to report to NBI MEDIC or CMS cases of fraud, waste, and abuse; cases of overprescribing; or any actions taken against providers. Plan sponsors collect information on cases of fraud, waste, and abuse, and can choose to report this information to NBI MEDIC or CMS. While CMS receives information from plan sponsors who voluntarily report their actions, it does not know the full extent to which plan sponsors have identified providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, or the full extent to which sponsors have taken action to reduce overprescribing. We concluded that without this information, it is difficult for CMS to assess progress in this area, which would be consistent with federal internal control standards. In our report, we recommended that CMS require plan sponsors to report on investigations and other actions taken related to providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids. HHS did not concur with this recommendation. HHS noted that plan sponsors have the responsibility to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, and that CMS reviews cases when it conducts audits. HHS also stated that it seeks to balance requirements on plan sponsors when considering new regulatory requirements. However, without complete reporting—such as reporting from all plan sponsors on the actions they take to reduce overprescribing—we believe that CMS is missing key information that could help assess progress in this area. Due to the importance of this information for achieving the agency’s goals, we continue to believe that CMS should require plan sponsors to report on the actions they take to reduce overprescribing. - - - - - In conclusion, a large number of Medicare Part D beneficiaries use potentially harmful levels of prescription opioids, and reducing the inappropriate prescribing of these drugs is a key part of CMS’s strategy to decrease the risk of opioid use disorder, overdoses, and deaths. Despite working to identify and decrease egregious opioid use behavior—such as doctor shopping—among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, CMS lacks the necessary information to effectively determine the full number of beneficiaries at risk of harm, as well as other information that could help CMS assess whether its efforts to reduce opioid overprescribing are effective. It is important that health care providers help patients to receive appropriate pain treatment, including opioids, based on the consideration of benefits and risks. Access to information on the risks that Medicare patients face from inappropriate or poorly monitored prescriptions, as well as information on providers who may be inappropriately prescribing opioids, could help CMS as it works to improve care.

In 2016, over 14 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries received opioid prescriptions, and spending for opioids was almost $4.1 billion. GAO and others have reported on inappropriate activities and risks associated with these prescriptions. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report (GAO-18-15) and discusses (1) CMS oversight of beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions under Part D, and (2) CMS oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. For the October 2017 report, GAO reviewed CMS opioid utilization and prescriber data, CMS guidance for plan sponsors, and CMS's strategy to prevent opioid misuse. GAO also interviewed CMS officials, the six largest Part D plan sponsors, and 12 national associations selected to represent insurance plans, pharmacy benefit managers, physicians, patients, and regulatory and law enforcement authorities. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides guidance on the monitoring of Medicare beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions to plan sponsors—private organizations that implement the Medicare drug benefit, Part D—but lacks information on most beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioid use. CMS provides guidance to plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and requires them to implement drug utilization review systems that use criteria similar to CMS's. CMS's criteria focused on beneficiaries who do all the following: (1) receive prescriptions of high doses of opioids, (2) receive prescriptions from four or more providers, and (3) fill prescriptions at four or more pharmacies. According to CMS, this approach focused actions on beneficiaries the agency determined to have the highest risk of harm. CMS's criteria, including recent revisions, do not provide sufficient information about the larger population of potentially at-risk beneficiaries. CMS estimates that while 33,223 beneficiaries would have met the revised criteria in 2015, 727,016 would have received high doses of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies. In 2016, CMS began to collect information on some of these beneficiaries using a higher dosage threshold for opioid use. This approach misses some who could be at risk of harm, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. As a result, CMS is limited in its ability to assess progress toward meeting the broader goals of its Opioid Misuse Strategy for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which includes activities to reduce the risk of harm to beneficiaries from opioid use. CMS oversees the prescribing of drugs at high risk of abuse through a variety of projects, but does not analyze data specifically on opioids. According to CMS officials, CMS and plan sponsors identify providers who prescribe large amounts of drugs with a high risk of abuse, and those suspected of fraud or abuse may be referred to law enforcement. However, GAO found that CMS does not identify providers who may be inappropriately prescribing large amounts of opioids separately from other drugs, and does not require plan sponsors to report actions they take when they identify such providers. As a result, CMS is lacking information that it could use to assess how opioid prescribing patterns are changing over time, and whether its efforts to reduce harm are effective. In the October 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations that CMS (1) gather information on the full number of at-risk beneficiaries receiving high doses of opioids, (2) identify providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and (3) require plan sponsors to report to CMS on actions related to providers who inappropriately prescribe opioids. HHS concurred with the first two recommendations, but not with the third. GAO continues to believe the recommendation is valid, as discussed in the report and in this statement."], "length": 2982, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e39320f4218829055d6b21d49dae66e043519591b2fb7651"}
{"input": "", "context": "Strong relations between the United States and Israel have led to bilateral cooperation in many areas. Matters of particular significance include the following: Israel's own capabilities for addressing threats, and its cooperation with the United States. Shared U.S.-Israel concerns about Iran, within the context of the U.S. exit from the 2015 international nuclear agreement, and growing tension involving Iran and Hezbollah at Israel's northern border with Syria and Lebanon. Israeli-Palestinian issues, including those involving Jerusalem, Hamas and the Gaza Strip, funding for Palestinians, and a possible Trump Administration peace plan. Israeli domestic political issues, including probable corruption-related indictments against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and closely contested elections that are scheduled for April 9, 2019. For background information and analysis on these and other topics, including aid, arms sales, and missile defense cooperation, see CRS Report RL33476, Israel: Background and U.S. Relations , by Jim Zanotti; and CRS Report RL33222, U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel , by Jeremy M. Sharp. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. These strengths include robust military and homeland security capabilities, as well as close cooperation with the United States. Israel maintains conventional military superiority relative to its neighbors and the Palestinians. Shifts in regional order and evolving asymmetric threats during this decade have led Israel to update its efforts to project military strength, deter attack, and defend its population and borders. Israel appears to have reduced some unconventional threats via missile defense systems, reported cyber defense and warfare capabilities, and other heightened security measures. Israel has a robust homeland security system featuring sophisticated early warning practices and thorough border and airport security controls; most of the country's buildings have reinforced rooms or shelters engineered to withstand explosions. Israel also has proposed and partially constructed a national border fence network of steel barricades (accompanied at various points by watch towers, patrol roads, intelligence centers, and military brigades) designed to minimize militant infiltration, illegal immigration, and smuggling from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Israeli authorities have built a separation barrier in and around parts of the West Bank. Israel is not a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and maintains a policy of \"nuclear opacity\" or amimut . A 2017 report estimated that Israel possesses a nuclear arsenal of around 80-85 warheads. The United States has countenanced Israel's nuclear ambiguity since 1969, when Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and U.S. President Richard Nixon reportedly reached an accord whereby both sides agreed never to acknowledge Israel's nuclear arsenal in public. Israel might have nuclear weapons deployable via aircraft, submarine, and ground-based missiles. No other Middle Eastern country is generally thought to possess nuclear weapons. Israeli officials closely consult with U.S. counterparts in an effort to influence U.S. decisionmaking on key regional issues, and U.S. law requires the executive branch to take certain actions to preserve Israel's \"qualitative military edge,\" or QME. Additionally, a 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing and to spend $500 million annually on joint missile defense programs from FY2019 to FY2028, subject to congressional appropriations. Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. They also argue that Israel is a valuable U.S. ally. The United States and Israel do not have a mutual defense treaty or agreement that provides formal U.S. security guarantees. Iran remains of primary concern to Israeli officials largely because of (1) Iran's antipathy toward Israel, (2) Iran's broad regional influence, and (3) the probability that some constraints on Iran's nuclear program could loosen in the future. In recent years, Israel and Arab Gulf states have discreetly cultivated closer relations with one another in efforts to counter Iran. Prime Minister Netanyahu has sought to influence U.S. decisions on the international agreement on Iran's nuclear program (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). He argued against the JCPOA when it was negotiated in 2015—including in a speech to a joint session of Congress—and welcomed President Trump's May 2018 withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA and accompanying reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran's core economic sectors. A few days before President Trump's May announcement, Netanyahu presented information that Israeli intelligence operatives apparently seized in early 2018 from an Iranian archive. He used the information to question Iran's credibility and highlight its potential to parlay existing know-how into nuclear-weapons breakthroughs after the JCPOA expires. In his September 2018 speech before the U.N. General Assembly, Netanyahu claimed that Iran maintains a secret \"atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel.\" An unnamed U.S. intelligence official was quoted as saying in response, \"so far as anyone knows, there is nothing in [the facility Netanyahu identified] that would allow Iran to break out of the JCPOA any faster than it otherwise could.\" After Netanyahu publicly exposed the Iranian nuclear archive, some former Israeli officials speculated about what action Israel might consider taking against Iranian nuclear facilities if Iran abrogates the JCPOA and expands nuclear activities currently restricted under the agreement. However, Netanyahu had said in an interview that he was not seeking a military confrontation with Iran. Israel and Iran have engaged in hostile action over Iran's presence in Syria. In the early years of the Syria conflict, Israel primarily employed air strikes to prevent Iranian weapons shipments destined for the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Later, as the Syrian government regained control of large portions of the country with Iranian backing, Israeli leaders began pledging to prevent Iran from constructing and operating bases or advanced weapons manufacturing facilities in Syria. Since 2018, Israeli and Iranian forces have repeatedly targeted one another in and over Syrian- and Israeli-controlled areas. In January 2019, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel had targeted Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria \"hundreds of times.\" Limited Israeli strikes to enforce \"redlines\" against Iran-backed forces could expand into wider conflict, particularly if there is a miscalculation by one or both sides. U.S. involvement in Syria could be one factor in Israeli calculations on this issue. The U.S. base at Al Tanf in southern Syria has reportedly \"served as a bulwark against Iran's efforts to create a land route for weapons from Iran to Lebanon.\" Israeli officials favor continued U.S. involvement in Syria, while also preparing for the possibility that they may need to take greater direct responsibility for countering Iran there. Russia's advanced air defense systems in Syria could make it more difficult for Israel to operate there. Since 2015, Russia has operated an S-400 system at Russia's Khmeimim air base in Lattakia, a city on Syria's Mediterranean coast. To date, however, Russia does not appear to have acted militarily to thwart Israeli air strikes against Iranian or Syrian targets, and Israel and Russia maintain communications aimed at deconflicting their operations. In addition to the S-400 that it owns and operates, Russia delivered an S-300 air defense system for Syria's military to Khmeimim airbase in October 2018. The delivery followed Syria's downing of a Russian military surveillance plane in September 2018 under disputed circumstances, shortly after an Israeli operation in the vicinity. According to an Israeli satellite imagery analysis company, three launchers appeared to be operational as of February 2019. It is unclear to what extent Russia has transferred the S-300 to Syrian military control, and how this might affect future Israeli military action in Syria. An Israeli journalist wrote that \"Israel has the knowledge, experience and equipment to evade the S-300, but the fact that additional batteries, manned by Russian personnel, are on the ground, will necessitate greater care [when carrying out future operations against Iran-aligned targets in Syria].\" Since the September 2018 incident, Israeli air strikes appear to have decreased somewhat. On March 25, 2019, President Trump signed a proclamation stating that the United States recognizes the Golan Heights (hereinafter, the Golan) to be part of the State of Israel. The proclamation stated that \"any possible future peace agreement in the region must account for Israel's need to protect itself from Syria and other regional threats\" —presumably including threats from Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. Israel gained control of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and effectively annexed it unilaterally by applying Israeli law to the region in 1981 (see Figure 2 ). President Trump's proclamation changed long-standing U.S. policy on the Golan. Since 1967, successive U.S. Administrations supported the general international stance that the Golan is Syrian territory occupied by Israel, with its final status subject to negotiation. In reaction to the U.S. proclamation, others in the international community have insisted that the Golan's status has not changed. In Congress, Senate and House bills introduced in February 2019 ( S. 567 and H.R. 1372 ) support Israeli sovereignty claims to the Golan, and would treat the Golan as part of Israel in any existing or future law \"relating to appropriations or foreign commerce.\" For decades after 1967, various Israeli leaders, reportedly including Prime Minister Netanyahu as late as 2011, had entered into indirect talks with Syria aimed at returning some portion of the Golan as part of a lasting peace agreement. However, the effect of civil war on Syria and the surrounding region, including an increase in Iran's presence, may have influenced Netanyahu to shift focus from negotiating with Syria on a \"land for peace\" basis to obtaining international support for Israel's claims of sovereignty. As part of the periodic conflict in Syria between Israel and Iran , some Iranian missiles have targeted Israeli positions in the Golan. The Syrian government has denounced the U.S. policy change as an illegal violation of Syrian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and insisted that Syria is determined to recover the Golan. Additionally, observers have argued that the policy change could unintentionally bolster Syrian President Bashar al Asad within Syria by rallying Syrian nationalistic sentiment in opposition to Israel's claims to the Golan and deflecting attention from Iran's activities inside Syria. Since 1974, the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has patrolled an area of the Golan Heights between the regions controlled by Israel and Syria, with about 880 troops from five countries stationed there as of January 2019. During that time, Israel's forces in the Golan have not faced serious military resistance to their continued deployment, despite some security threats and diplomatic challenges. Periodic resolutions by the U.N. General Assembly have criticized Israel's occupation as hindering regional peace and Israel's settlement and de facto annexation of the Golan as illegal. Hezbollah's forces and Israel's military have sporadically clashed near the Lebanese border for decades—with the antagonism at times contained in the border area, and at times escalating into broader conflict. Speculation persists about the potential for wider conflict and its regional implications. Israeli officials have sought to draw attention to Hezbollah's buildup of mostly Iran-supplied weapons—including reported upgrades to the range, precision, and power of its projectiles—and its alleged use of Lebanese civilian areas as strongholds. Ongoing tension between Israel and Iran over Iran's presence in Syria raises questions about the potential for Hezbollah's forces in Lebanon to open another front against Israel. After the September 2018 incident leading to Russia's installation of an S-300 system in Syria (discussed above), Iran reportedly began directly transferring weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon while reducing Syria's use as a transshipment hub. One Israeli media account warned that Hezbollah's threat to Israel is increasing because of initiatives to build precision-weapons factories in Lebanon and to set up a military infrastructure in southern Syria. In late 2018 and early 2019, Israel's military undertook an effort—dubbed \"Operation Northern Shield\"—to seal six Hezbollah attack tunnels to prevent them from crossing into Israel. Israeli officials claim that they do not want another war, while at the same time taking measures aimed at constraining and deterring Hezbollah, including through consultation with the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). President Trump has expressed interest in brokering a final-status Israeli-Palestinian agreement, and his Administration has supposedly prepared a proposal to facilitate negotiations, but the Administration has repeatedly postponed releasing the proposal. Many factors may account for the delays, including recent U.S. actions regarding Jerusalem, tension in and around the Gaza Strip, reduced funding for the Palestinians, Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and political jockeying and domestic constraints among Israelis and Palestinians. The U.S. decision—announced in December 2017—to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. embassy there has fed U.S.-Palestinian tensions. Israeli leaders generally celebrated the change, but Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman and Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas strongly objected. Many other countries opposed President Trump's actions on Jerusalem, as reflected in action at the United Nations. Claiming U.S. bias favoring Israel, Palestinian leaders broke off high-level political contacts with the United States shortly after the December 2017 announcement and have made efforts to advance Palestinian national claims in international fora. However, the PA continues security coordination with Israel in the West Bank. U.S.-Palestinian tensions appear to have influenced Administration decisions to cut off various types of U.S. funding to the Palestinians, and arguably have dimmed prospects for restarting Israeli-Palestinian talks. In a September 2018 address before the U.N. General Assembly, PLO Chairman/PA President Abbas denounced Administration actions that he characterized as taking disputed Israeli-Palestinian issues—such as Jerusalem's status and Palestinian refugee claims—off the negotiating table. Funding for economic and humanitarian needs in the West Bank and Gaza could become even scarcer. In February 2019, Israel announced that it would withhold a portion of the tax revenue it collects for the PA because—pursuant to a law passed by the Knesset in 2018—Israel had determined that amount represented PLO/PA payments made on behalf of individuals allegedly involved in terrorist acts. In response, Abbas announced that the PA would completely reject monthly revenue transfers from Israel if it withheld any amount, even though the transfers comprise approximately 65% of the PA budget. For February, Israel withheld approximately $11 million from the $193 million due to the PA, with the PA rejecting the entire amount as a result. The PA is reportedly seeking temporary financial support from the private sector and local banks, and also asking the Arab League to follow through on its 2010 decision to provide $100 million per month as a \"financial safety net\" for the PA. At the end of January 2019, U.S. bilateral aid to the Palestinians—including nonlethal security assistance that Israel generally supports—ended completely due to the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (ATCA, P.L. 115-253 ), which became law on October 3, 2018. Two months after the law's enactment, PA Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah informed Secretary of State Michael Pompeo that the PA would not accept aid that subjected it to federal court jurisdiction. Apparently, U.S. aid will not resume unless Congress amends or repeals the ATCA, or the Administration channels the aid differently. Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor Jared Kushner has stated that the Administration will publicly release a peace plan sometime after Israeli national elections, which are set to occur on April 9, 2019. According to Kushner, the peace plan contains detailed proposals on the various issues that divide Israel and the PLO. Many observers express skepticism about the prospect that these proposals can serve as a basis for the serious resumption of bilateral talks, but Kushner has reportedly said that the Administration is focusing on formulating \"realistic solutions,\" and that \"privately, people are more flexible.\" U.S. officials hope to surmount potential obstacles to the peace plan in the Israeli and Palestinian domestic arenas by obtaining political and economic support for the U.S. initiative from key Arab states in the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Egypt. A number of Arab states share common interests in working behind the scenes with Israel to counter Iranian regional influence. While some diplomatic developments have fed speculation about warming Arab-Israeli ties, reports suggest that key Arab Gulf states remain reluctant to embrace more formal relations with Israel without a resolution of the Palestinian issue. Saudi Arabia's press agency responded to the U.S. recognition of Israel's claims to sovereignty in the Golan Heights by saying that it \"will have significant negative effects on the peace process in the Middle East and the security and stability of the region.\" In a statement with implications both for domestic and international audiences, Prime Minister Netanyahu reportedly said that the March 2019 change in U.S. policy on the Golan proves that countries can retain territory captured in a defensive war. His statement prompted speculation over the possibility that Israeli leaders might consider annexing part of the West Bank and whether the situation in the Golan is sufficiently similar to invite comparison. Days before the April elections, Netanyahu asserted that if he were to lead the next government, he would apply Israeli law to West Bank settlements. The closely contested Israeli national elections—scheduled for April 9, 2019—and the subsequent government formation process will have significant implications for the country's leadership and future policies. Prime Minister Netanyahu faces a challenge from the centrist Blue and White party under the combined leadership of former top general Benny Gantz and former Finance Minister Yair Lapid. Some setbacks for Netanyahu during the campaign have included the attorney general's announcement of probable corruption-related indictments against Netanyahu, new media allegations of possible misconduct relating to Israel's procurement of German submarines, and questions about some individuals or groups possibly spreading rumors against Netanyahu's opponents via social media. Yet, some observers calculate that Netanyahu's Likud could possibly get fewer Knesset seats than Blue and White and still form the next coalition. For more information on the actors involved in the elections, see CRS Insight IN11068, Israel: April 2019 Elections and Probable Indictments Against Prime Minister Netanyahu , by Jim Zanotti and this report's Appendix . In July 2018, the Knesset passed a Basic Law defining Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people. Some observers have expressed concern that the law might further undermine the place of Arabs in Israeli society, while others view its effect as mainly symbolic. In March 2019, Netanyahu said that Israel is a Jewish, democratic state with equal rights for all its citizens, and \"the nation-state not of all its citizens, but only of the Jewish people,\" reviving domestic debate about the 2018 law and perhaps seeking support during the election campaign from sympathetic voter groups.", "answers": ["Strong relations between the United States and Israel have led to bilateral cooperation in many areas. Matters of particular significance to U.S.-Israel relations include Israel's ability to address the threats it faces in its region. Shared U.S.-Israel concerns about Iran and its allies on the nuclear issue and in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli-Palestinian issues. Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire. Domestically, Israel is preparing for the April 9 elections, which are closely contested. Former top general Benny Gantz is combining with former Finance Minister Yair Lapid to challenge Netanyahu, whom the attorney general has recommended be indicted for corruption in three separate cases. The elections and subsequent government formation process will have significant implications for Israel's future leadership and policies."], "length": 3679, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a3a11ee5de13be1f6ab405e8e1b29f2cd07929fe9112561a"}
{"input": "", "context": "M ost of the funding for the activities of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) comes from discretionary appropriations provided each year in annual appropriations acts, typically as a part of the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (THUD). HUD's programs are designed primarily to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs and to expand access to homeownership. Three main rental assistance programs—Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance (which funds Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers), Section 8 project-based rental assistance, and public housing—account for the majority of the department's funding (about 78% of total HUD appropriations in FY2018; see Figure 1 ). All three programs provide deep subsidies allowing low-income recipients to pay below-market, income-based rents. Additional, smaller programs are targeted specifically to persons who are elderly and persons with disabilities. Two flexible block grant programs—the HOME Investment Partnerships grant program and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program—help states and local governments finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families. Following disasters, special supplemental CDBG disaster recovery (CDBG-DR) grants are funded by Congress to help communities rebuild damaged housing and community infrastructure. Native American tribes receive their own direct housing grants through the Native American Housing Block Grant. Other, more-specialized grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons, through the Homeless Assistance Grants and the Continuum of Care and Emergency Solutions Grants programs, as well as those living with HIV/AIDS. Additional programs fund fair housing enforcement activities and healthy homes activities, including lead-based paint hazard identification and remediation. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by lenders to homebuyers with low down payments and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers, which are used to sustain its insurance funds. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset the cost of the HUD budget. This In Brief report tracks progress on FY2019 HUD appropriations and provides detailed account-level, and in some cases subaccount-level, funding information ( Table 1 ) as well as a discussion of selected key issues. For more information about the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations bill see CRS Report R45487, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations for FY2019: In Brief , by Maggie McCarty and David Randall Peterman.

Composition of HUD's Budget, FY2018Gross Budget AuthoritySource: Prepared by CRS, based on data in Table 1.Notes: Primary rental assistance programs include Tenant-based Rental Assistance (Housing Choice Voucher Program), Public Housing Capital Fund, Public Housing Operating Fund, Choice Neighborhoods, Family Self Sufficiency Program, and Project-based Rental Assistance. Formula grants include CDBG, HOME, Homeless Assistance Grants, Housing for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), and Native American Housing Block Grants. Other programs and activities encompass the remainder of HUD accounts. The FY2019 appropriations process spanned two Congresses, both of which took action, as summarized below. On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress. The budget request was released before final FY2018 appropriations were enacted and shortly after enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of FY2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123 ), which, among other things, increased the statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2018 and FY2019. The President's FY2019 request proposed $41.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD, which is the amount of new budget authority available for HUD programs and activities, not accounting for savings from offsets and other sources. That amount is about $11.3 billion (21.5%) less than was provided in FY2018. Most of that reduction ($7.7 billion) is attributable to program eliminations proposed by the President, including CDBG, HOME, Public Housing Capital Funding, Choice Neighborhoods grants, and the programs funded in the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) account. On May 23, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of a FY2019 THUD appropriations bill ( H.R. 6072 ; H.Rept. 115-750 ), about a week after THUD subcommittee approval (May 16, 2018). The bill included $53.2 billion in gross funding for HUD, or $43.7 billion after accounting for savings from offsets and rescissions. This is about 29% more in gross funding than was requested by the President and slightly more (1%) than was provided in FY2018. The bill did not include the program eliminations proposed by the President, and instead funded CDBG and the Public Housing Capital Fund at FY2018 levels while reducing funding for the HOME and SHOP accounts (-12% and -7%, respectively). On June 7, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of a FY2019 THUD appropriations bill ( S. 3023 ; S.Rept. 115-268 ), two days after THUD subcommittee approval. It included more than $54 billion in gross funding for HUD, or $44.5 billion after accounting for savings from offsets and rescissions. This is 30% more in gross funding than was requested by the President, and about 2.5% more than was provided in FY2018. Like the House committee-passed bill, S. 3023 did not include the President's proposed program eliminations, and instead proposed funding those programs at their prior-year levels. On August 1, 2018, the Senate approved H.R. 6147 , the Financial Services Appropriations bill, which was amended to include four regular appropriations acts, including the text of S. 3023 as Division D. Several HUD-related amendments were approved during floor consideration, none of which changed funding levels. On September 28, 2018, a continuing resolution (CR) through December 7, 2018, was enacted as part of a consolidated full-year Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education spending bill ( P.L. 115-245 , Division C). The CR covered the agencies and activities generally funded under seven regular FY2019 appropriations bills that had not been enacted before the end of the fiscal year, including THUD. On December 7, 2018, the previous CR was extended through December 21, 2018 ( P.L. 115-298 ). No further funding action was completed before the expiration of the CR on December 21, 2018, and a funding lapse affecting the unfunded portions of the federal government, including HUD, commenced on December 22, 2018. Following the start of the 116 th Congress and during the funding lapse, the House passed several full-year THUD funding bills, none of which were taken up in the Senate. These include the following: H.R. 21 , an omnibus funding bill, which included THUD language identical to that which had passed the Senate in the 115 th Congress in H.R. 6147 ; H.R. 267 , a standalone THUD bill, again containing language identical to the 115 th Congress Senate-passed THUD language; and H.R. 648 , an omnibus funding bill containing provisions and funding levels characterized by the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee as reflecting House-Senate conference negotiations on H.R. 6147 from the 115 th Congress. (The Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019 was included as Division F.) On January 16, 2019, the House passed H.R. 268 , a supplemental appropriations bill. As passed by the House, the bill would have provided supplemental appropriations to HUD (as well as other agencies) in response to the major disasters of 2018. The bill also contained CR provisions to extend regular appropriations through February 8, 2019, for agencies and programs affected by the funding lapse. On January 24, 2019, the Senate considered H.R. 268 , the supplemental appropriations bill that previously passed the House. One amendment, S.Amdt. 5 , offered by Senator Shelby, included additional funding for border security, as well as full-year appropriations for those agencies affected by the funding lapse. The THUD provisions in Division G were identical to those that had passed the Senate in the 115 th Congress in H.R. 6147 . The Senate voted not to invoke cloture on S.Amdt. 5 on January 24, 2019. Late on January 25, 2019, a CR ( H.J.Res. 28 ; P.L. 116-5 ) was enacted, providing funding through February 15, 2019, for THUD and the six other funding bills that had not received full-year funding, allowing HUD and the other agencies that had been subject to the funding lapse to resume full operations. On February 15, 2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) was enacted providing full-year appropriations for the remaining agencies that had lacked full-year appropriations. The Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019 was included as Division G and its text mirrored that of H.R. 648 . The cost of renewing existing Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers is generally one of the most high-profile HUD funding issues each year. It is the largest single expense in the largest account (the tenant-based rental assistance account) in HUD's budget. All of the roughly 2 million portable rental vouchers that are currently authorized and in use are funded annually, so for the low-income families currently renting housing with their vouchers to continue to receive assistance (i.e., renew their leases at the end of the year), new funding is needed each year. If the amount ultimately provided proves to be less than the amount needed to fund all vouchers currently in use, then several things may happen. The Public Housing Authorities (PHAs)—the state-chartered entities that administer the program at the local level—with reserve funding from prior years, may spend some of those reserves to maintain current services. PHAs without reserve funding may apply to HUD for a share of the set-aside funding that is generally provided in the annual appropriations acts to the department and allowed to be used to prevent termination of assistance. And PHAs may undertake cost-saving measures, such as not reissuing vouchers to families on their waiting lists when currently assisted families leave the program. Conversely, if the amount is greater than the amount needed to renew existing vouchers, PHAs may be able to serve additional families from their waiting lists. Although the President's budget request, the House committee-reported HUD appropriations bill, and the Senate bill all included different funding levels for voucher renewals for FY2019, each purported to provide enough to fund all vouchers currently in use. The final FY2019 enacted funding level was $22.598 billion, an amount between the House committee-reported and Senate-passed levels. Advocacy groups have estimated that the amount provided will be enough at least to renew all existing voucher holders' leases, as well as potentially serve some additional families. The low-rent public housing program houses approximately 1 million families in properties owned by local PHAs but subsidized by the federal government. PHAs' budgets for public housing are made up of rent paid by tenants and formula grant funding from the federal government to make up the difference between the rents collected from tenants and the cost of maintaining the properties. The two primary formula funding programs are Operating Fund program and Capital Fund program. Additionally, PHAs may apply for competitive Choice Neighborhood Initiative grants. The largest source of federal funding to support the low-rent public housing program is provided through the public housing Operating Fund account. Operating funds are allocated to PHAs according to a formula that estimates what it should cost PHAs to maintain their public housing properties based on the characteristics of those properties. When the amount of appropriations provided is insufficient to fully fund the amount PHAs qualify for under the formula, their allocation is prorated. Assuming the Operating Fund formula accurately reflects the costs of maintaining public housing, less than full funding means PHAs either will not be able to meet their full operating needs (e.g., maintenance, staffing, services for residents) or will have to spend down reserves they may have accumulated or seek other sources of funding. According to HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications, the amount requested in the President's budget for the Operating Fund for FY2019 (a 28% decrease from FY2018) would be sufficient to fund an estimated 54% of PHAs' formula eligibility in CY2019 (the program runs on a calendar year basis). Both the House committee-passed bill and the Senate bill proposed more funding than requested, but neither proposed the full amount the President's budget estimated would be needed to fully fund PHAs' formula eligibility in CY2019. The final HUD appropriations law provided $4.65 billion for operating funding in FY2019, which is more than the House committee-passed bill, but less than the Senate level. While it is not expected to fund 100% of formula eligibility in CY2019, the funding increase may result in a higher proration level than CY2018. The other major source of federal funding for public housing is the Capital Fund. Capital Fund formula grants are used to meet the major modernization needs of public housing, beyond the day-to-day maintenance expenses included among operating expenses. The most recent national assessment of public housing capital needs sponsored by HUD found that inadequate funding had resulted in a backlog of about $25.6 billion in capital/modernization needs across the public housing stock, with new needs accruing nationally at a rate of about $3.4 billion per year. For FY2019, the President's budget requested no funding for the Capital Fund, citing federal fiscal constraints and a desire to \"strategically reduce the footprint of Public Housing.\" Both the House committee bill and the Senate bill would have provided funding for the Capital Fund, with H.Rept. 115-750 explicitly stating that it rejected the Administration's proposed strategic reduction of public housing. The final FY2019 appropriations law provided $2.775 billion for the Capital Fund, a $25 million increase over FY2018 funding. That $25 million is provided as a set-aside to provide grants to PHAs to address lead hazards in public housing. Similarly, the Administration's budget requested no new funding for competitive Choice Neighborhoods grants that are used to redevelop distressed public housing and other assisted housing. Both the House committee bill and the Senate bill proposed to fund the program. The House committee bill proposed even funding with FY2018 ($150 million) and the Senate bill proposed a decrease in funding relative to FY2018 (a reduction of $50 million, or 33%). The final FY2019 appropriations law funded the account at the FY2018 level of $150 million. The President's budget request included a proposal to eliminate funding for several HUD grant programs that support various affordable housing and community development activities. Most notable among these are HUD's two largest block grant programs for states and localities, CDBG and HOME, as well as competitive grants funded in the SHOP account (i.e., funding for sweat-equity programs, like Habitat for Humanity, and certain capacity building programs). These grant programs were also slated for elimination in the President's FY2018 budget request, although they were ultimately funded in FY2018. The press release accompanying the budget request suggested that the activities funded by these grant programs should be devolved to the state and local levels. Both the House committee bill and the Senate bill would have continued funding for these programs. The House committee bill would have provided level funding for CDBG, but funding reductions for the other accounts. The Senate bill would have provided level funding for all three accounts. Like the House committee and Senate bills, the final FY2019 appropriations law continued funding for all three accounts. In the case of CDBG and SHOP, it provided level funding with FY2018 at $3.365 billion and $54 million, respectively; in the case of HOME, the FY2019 law decreased funding by 8.2% relative to FY2018, bringing it down to $1.250 billion. Under the terms of the Budget Control Act, as amended, discretionary appropriations are generally subject to limits, or caps, on the amount of funding that can be provided in a fiscal year. In addition, the annual appropriations bills also are individually subject to limits on the funding within them that are associated with the annual congressional budget resolution. Congressional appropriators can keep these bills within their respective limits in a number of ways, including by providing less funding for certain purposes to allow for increases elsewhere in the bill. In certain circumstances, appropriators also can credit \"offsetting collections\" or \"offsetting receipts\" against the funding in the bill, thereby lowering the net amount of budget authority in that bill. In the THUD bill, the largest source of these offsets is generally the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA generates offsetting receipts when estimates suggest that the loans that it will insure during the fiscal year are expected to collect more in fees paid by borrowers than will be needed to pay default claims to lenders over the life of those loans.  While usually not as large a source, the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), or Ginnie Mae, generally provides significant offsets within the THUD bill as well. GNMA guarantees mortgage-backed securities made up of government-insured mortgages (such as FHA-insured mortgages) and similarly generates offsetting receipts when the associated fees it collects are estimated to exceed any payments made on its guarantee. The amount of offsets available from FHA and GNMA varies from year to year based on estimates of the amount of mortgages that FHA will insure, and that GNMA will guarantee, in a given year and how much those mortgages are expected to earn for the government. These estimates, in turn, are based on expectations about the housing market, the economy, the credit quality of borrowers, and relevant fee levels, most of which are factors outside of the immediate control of policymakers. If the amount of available offsets increases from one year to the next, then additional funds could be appropriated relative to the prior year's funding level while still maintaining the same overall net level of budget authority. If the amount of offsets decreases, however, then less funding would need to be appropriated relative to the prior year to avoid increasing the overall net level of budget authority, all else equal. For FY2019, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that offsetting receipts available from FHA would be lower than in FY2018 ($7.6 billion compared to $8.3 billion) while the amount of offsets available from Ginnie Mae would be higher (about $2 billion compared to $1.7 billion). The total combined amount of offsets, then, was estimated at about $500 million less in FY2019 as compared to the prior year. As a result of this lower amount of offsets, the increase in net budget authority proposed in both the House committee bill and the Senate bill, as well as that ultimately provided by the final FY2019 appropriations law, as compared to FY2018 is greater than the increase in gross appropriations for HUD programs and activities.

{"input": "", "context": "Burn pits—shallow excavations or surface features with berms used to conduct open-air burning—were often chosen as a method of waste disposal during recent contingency operations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, which extends from the Middle East to Central Asia and includes Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010, we reported that there were 251 active burns pits in Afghanistan and 22 in Iraq. However, in 2016, we reported that the use of burn pits in the CENTCOM area of responsibility had declined since that time. As of June 2016, DOD officials told us that there were no military-operated burn pits in Afghanistan and only one in Iraq. According to DOD officials, the decline in the number of burn pits from 2010 to 2016 could be attributed to such factors as (1) using contractors for waste disposal and (2) increased use of waste management alternatives such as landfills and incinerators. However, DOD officials acknowledged that burn pits were being used to dispose of waste in other locations that are not military-operated. Specifically, these officials noted instances in which local contractors had been contracted to haul away waste and subsequently disposed of the waste in a burn pit located in close proximity to the installation. In such instances, officials stated that they requested that the contractors relocate the burn pit. According to a DOD official, as of May 2018 there are two active burn pits in the CENTCOM area of responsibility. Although burn pits help base commanders to manage waste, they also produce smoke and emissions that military and other health professionals believe may result in acute and chronic health effects for those exposed. We previously reported that some veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have reported pulmonary and respiratory ailments, among other health concerns, that they attributed to burn pit emissions. Numerous veterans have also filed lawsuits against a DOD contractor alleging that the contractor mismanaged burn pit operations at several installations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, resulting in exposure to harmful smoke that caused these adverse health effects. We also previously reported on the difficulty of establishing a correlation between occupational and environmental exposures and health issues. For example, in 2012 we reported that establishing causation between an exposure and an adverse health condition can be difficult for several reasons, including that for many environmental exposures, there is a latency period—the time period between initial exposure to a contaminant and the date on which an adverse health condition is diagnosed. When there is a long latency period between an environmental exposure and an adverse health condition, choosing between multiple causes of exposure may be difficult. In addition, in 2015 we reported that the Army had recently published a study that evaluated associations between deployment to Iraq and Kuwait and the development of respiratory conditions post-deployment. However, the study was unable to identify a causal link between exposures to burn pits and respiratory conditions. In our 2016 report, we found that the effects from exposing individuals to burn pit emissions were not well understood, and DOD had not fully assessed these health risks. Under DOD Instruction 6055.01, DOD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program, it is DOD policy to apply risk-management strategies to eliminate occupational injury or illness and loss of mission capability or resources. DOD Instruction 6055.01 also instructs all DOD components to establish procedures to ensure that risk- acceptance decisions were documented, archived, and reevaluated on a recurring basis. Furthermore, DOD Instruction 6055.05, Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH), requires that hazards be identified and risk evaluated as early as possible, including the consideration of exposure patterns, duration, and rates. Notwithstanding this guidance, which applies to burn pit emissions among other health hazards, DOD had not fully assessed the health risks of use of burn pits according to DOD officials. According to DOD officials, DOD’s ability to assess these risks was limited by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to burn pit emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures had on individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD had not collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as required by its own guidance. DOD Instruction 4715.19 requires that plans for the use of open-air burn pits include ensuring the area was monitored by qualified force health protection personnel for unacceptable exposures, and CENTCOM Regulation 200-2, CENTCOM Contingency Environmental Standards, requires steps to be taken to sample or monitor burn pit emissions. However, DOD officials stated that there were no processes in place to specifically monitor burn pit emissions for the purposes of correlating potential exposures. They attributed this to a lack of singular exposure to the burn pit emissions, or emissions from any other individual item; instead, monitoring was done for the totality of air pollutants from all sources at the point of population exposure. As we reported in September 2016, given the potential use of burn pits near installations and their potential use in future contingency operations, establishing processes to monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures would better position DOD and combatant commanders to collect data that could help assess exposure to risks. In the absence of the collection of data to examine the effects of burn pit exposure on servicemembers, the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2014 created the airborne hazards and open-air burn pit registry, which allows eligible individuals to self-report exposures to airborne hazards (such as smoke from burn pits, oil-well fires, or pollution during deployment), as well as other exposures and health concerns. The registry helps to monitor health conditions affecting veterans and servicemembers, and to collect data that would assist in improving programs to help those with deployment exposure concerns. With respect to the information on the health effects from exposure to burn pit emissions, DOD officials stated that there were short-term effects from being exposed to toxins from the burning of waste, such as eye irritation and burning, coughing and throat irritation, breathing difficulties, and skin itching and rashes. However, the officials also stated that DOD did not have enough data to confirm whether direct exposure to burn pits caused long-term health issues. Although DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs had commissioned studies to enhance their understanding of airborne hazards, including burn pit emissions, the then- current lack of data on emissions specific to burn pits limited DOD’s ability to fully assess potential health impacts on servicemembers and other base personnel, such as contractors. For example, in a 2011 study that was contracted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Institute of Medicine stated that it was unable to determine whether long-term health effects are likely to result from burn pit exposure due to inadequate evidence of an association. While the study did not determine a linkage to long-term health effects, because of the lack of data, it did not discredit the relationship either. Rather, it outlined a methodology of how to collect the necessary data to determine the effects of the exposure. Specifically, the 2011 study outlined the feasibility and design issues for an epidemiologic study—that is, a study of the distribution and determinants of diseases and injuries in human populations—of veterans exposed to burn pit emissions. Further, the 2011 study reported that there were a variety of methods for collecting exposure information, but the most desirable was to measure exposures quantitatively at the individual level. Individual exposure measurements could be obtained through personal monitoring data or biomonitoring. However, if individual monitoring data were not available, and they rarely are, individual exposure data might also be estimated from modeling of exposures, self-reported surveys, interviews, job exposure matrixes, and environmental monitoring. Further, to determine the incidence of chronic disease, the study stated that servicemembers must be tracked from their time of deployment, over many years. While the Institute of Medicine outlined a methodology of how to conduct an epidemiologic study, DOD had not taken steps to conduct this type of research study, specifically one that focused on the direct, individual exposure to burn pit emissions and the possible long-term health effects of such exposure. Instead, some officials commented that there were no long-term health effects linked to the exposures of burn pits because the 2011 study did not acknowledge any. Conversely, Veterans Affairs officials stated that a study aimed at establishing health effect linkages could be enabled by the data in its airborne hazards and open-air burn pit registry, which collects self-reported information on servicemembers’ deployment location and exposure. In response to a mandate contained in section 201 of Public Law 112- 260, the Department of Veterans Affairs entered into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to convene a committee to provide recommendations on collecting, maintaining, and monitoring information through the registry. The committee assessed the effectiveness of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ information gathering efforts and provided recommendations for addressing the future medical needs of the affected groups. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 was a review of the data collection methods and outcomes, as well as an analysis of the self- reported veteran experience data gathered in the registry. Phase 2 was focused on the assessment of the effectiveness of the actions taken by the Department of Veterans Affairs and DOD and provided recommendations for improving the methods enacted. The committee released its final report in February 2017. As we reported in September 2016, considering the results of this review as well as the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine study as part of an examination of the relationship between direct, individual exposure to burn pit emissions and long-term health effects could better position DOD to fully assess those health risks. In our September 2016 report we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to: take steps to ensure CENTCOM and other geographic combatant commands, as appropriate, establish processes to consistently monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures; and in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, specifically examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure and potential long-term health-related issues. As part of that examination, consider the results of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s report on the Department of Veteran Affairs registry and the methodology outlined in the 2011 Institute of Medicine study that suggests the need to evaluate the health status of service members from their time of deployment over many years to determine their incidence of chronic disease, with particular attention to the collection of data at the individual level, including the means by which that data is obtained. DOD concurred with the first recommendation, stating that the department will ensure that geographic combatant commands establish and employ processes to consistently monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures at the point of exposure and if necessary at individual sources. In a May 2018 status update regarding this recommendation, DOD stated that it will be updating applicable department policy and procedures, its tactics techniques and procedures manual, and guidance for sampling and analysis plans to improve monitoring of burn pit emissions and other airborne hazard emissions. Specifically, DOD stated it will update DOD Instruction 6490.03, Deployment Health; that the update will provide revised procedures on deployment health activities required before, during, and after deployments, including Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessments; and that it estimates this will be completed by the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, the department stated it will update its Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessments tactics, techniques, and procedures manual and update guidance for sampling and analysis plans and that the updates will provide revised tactics, techniques, and procedures that will improve the quality of health risk assessment. The department expects this to be completed by the 1st quarter of fiscal year 2019. GAO believes that upon completion of these actions, DOD will have met the intent of this recommendation. With respect to our recommendation to sponsor research, in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to specifically examine the relationship between burn pit exposure and potential health-related issues, DOD partially concurred, stating that a considerable volume of research studies had already been completed, were ongoing, or were planned in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other research entities to improve the understanding of burn pit and other ambient exposures to potential long-term health outcomes and that the studies, where applicable, consider and incorporate the methodology outlined in the 2011 Institute of Medicine study. In a May 2018 status update regarding this recommendation, the department stated that DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to collaborate with each other and other entities on research activities that address burn pit and other airborne exposures, and potential long-term health outcomes. Specifically, the department cited a DOD/Veterans Affairs Airborne Hazards Symposium held in May 2017; an update to the Veterans Affairs/DOD Deployment Health Working Group \"Airborne Hazards Joint Action Plan\" to be completed by the 3rd quarter of fiscal year 2018; and the completion of research to examine airborne hazard exposures and potential health-related issues. GAO believes that to the extent that continued studies consider and incorporate the methodology outlined the 2011 Institute of Medicine study, where appropriate, DOD will have met the intent of this recommendation.

This statement provides information on the extent to which DOD has assessed any health risks of burn pit use. This statement is based on a GAO report issued in September 2016 (GAO-16-781). The report was conducted in response to section 313 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck” McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Specifically, GAO assessed the methodology DOD used in conducting a review of the compliance of the military departments and combatant commands with DOD instructions governing the use of burn pits in contingency operations and the adequacy of a DOD report for the defense committees. GAO also obtained updates from DOD on actions taken to assess health risks from burn pits since September 2016. GAO reported in September 2016 that the effects from exposing individuals to burn pit emissions were not well understood, and the Department of Defense (DOD) had not fully assessed the health risks associated with the use of burn pits. Burn pits—shallow excavations or surface features with berms used to conduct open-air burning—were often chosen as a method of waste disposal during recent contingency operations in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility, which extends from the Middle East to Central Asia and includes Iraq and Afghanistan. According to DOD Instruction 6055.01, DOD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program , DOD should apply risk-management strategies to eliminate occupational injury or illness and loss of mission capability or resources. The instruction also requires all DOD components to establish procedures to ensure that risk-acceptance decisions were documented, archived, and reevaluated on a recurring basis. Furthermore, DOD Instruction 6055.05, Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH), requires that hazards be identified and risk evaluated as early as possible, including the consideration of exposure patterns, duration, and rates. While DOD has guidance that applies to burn pit emissions among other health hazards, DOD had not fully assessed the health risks of use of burn pits, according to DOD officials. According to DOD officials, DOD's ability to assess these risks was limited by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to burn pit emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures had on individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD had not collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as required by its own guidance. Given the potential use of burn pits near installations and during future contingency operations, establishing processes to monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures would better position DOD and combatant commanders to collect data that could help assess exposure to risks. GAO recommended that the Secretary of Defense (1) take steps to ensure CENTCOM and other geographic combatant commands, as appropriate, establish processes to consistently monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures; and (2) in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, specifically examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure and potential long-term health-related issues. DOD concurred with the first recommendation and partially concurred with the second. In a May 2018 status update regarding these recommendations, DOD outlined a series of steps it had implemented as well as steps that it intends to implement. The department believes these efforts will further enhance its ability to better monitor burn-pit emissions and examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure and potential long-term health related issues. GAO believes the steps DOD is taking are appropriate. GAO made two recommendations focused on improving monitoring of burn pit emissions and examining any associated health effects related to burn pit exposure. DOD concurred with one recommendation and partially concurred with the other. GAO continues to believe the recommendations are valid."], "length": 2999, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a52b972a6051b61f61eefad3a6358e3f4f89c1a6872dd5a9"}
{"input": "", "context": "In our September 2018 report on broadband access on tribal lands, we found that FCC collects broadband availability data from broadband providers, but its method for collecting the data does not accurately or completely capture broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC directs fixed broadband providers to submit a list of census blocks where service is available on their Form 477 filings. In the Form 477 instructions, FCC defines “available” as whether the provider does—or could, within a typical service interval or without an extraordinary commitment of resources—provide service to at least one end-user premises in a census block. Thus, in its annual reports and maps of fixed broadband service, FCC considers an entire block to be served if a provider reports that it does, or could offer, service to at least one household in the census block. As shown in figure 1, FCC’s definition of availability leads to overstatements of fixed broadband availability on tribal lands by: (1) counting an entire census block as served if only one location has broadband, and (2) allowing providers to report availability in blocks where they do not have any infrastructure connecting homes to their networks if the providers determine they could offer service to at least one household. FCC has noted that overstatements of availability can be particularly problematic in rural areas, where census blocks cover larger areas. According to FCC officials, FCC requires providers to report fixed broadband availability where they could provide service to: (1) ensure that it captures instances in which a provider has a network nearby but has not installed the last connection to the homes, and (2) identify where service is connected to homes, but homes have not subscribed. FCC officials also told us that FCC measures availability at the census block level because sub-census block data may be costly to collect. However, FCC acknowledged that by requiring a provider to report where it could provide service, it is not possible to tell whether the provider would be unable or unwilling to take on additional subscribers in a census block it lists as served. In addition, when reporting on broadband access in tribal lands, FCC uses the broadband availability data described above, and does not collect information on factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access. These factors include affordability, service quality, and service denials. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most. We recommended FCC develop and implement methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands. FCC agreed with this recommendation and stated that it is exploring methods to collect more granular broadband deployment data. As we reported in September 2018, FCC does not have a formal process to obtain input from tribes on the accuracy of the data and tribal stakeholders can face difficulties obtaining information from providers. FCC’s 2010 National Broadband Plan noted the need for the federal government to improve the quality of data regarding broadband on tribal lands and recommended that FCC work with tribes to ensure that any information collected is accurate and useful. Although the Plan also noted that tribal representatives should have the opportunity to review mapping data and offer supplemental data or corrections, FCC lacks a formal process to obtain tribal input on its broadband data. FCC officials told us that they address questions and concerns regarding providers’ coverage claims submitted to FCC’s Office of Native Affairs and Policy. However, about half of the tribal representatives we spoke to stated that they were not aware of the Form 477 data or corresponding maps, or raised concerns about a lack of outreach from FCC to inform tribes about the data. Most of the tribal stakeholders we interviewed told us that FCC should work more directly with tribes to obtain information from them to improve the accuracy of FCC’s broadband deployment data for tribal lands. These stakeholders identified several ways in which FCC could work with tribes on this issue, including onsite visits, increased outreach and technical training, and opportunities for tribes to collect their own data or submit feedback regarding the accuracy of FCC’s data. FCC’s National Broadband Plan also noted the importance of supporting tribal efforts to build technical expertise with respect to broadband issues. A few of the stakeholders we interviewed noted that tribes have faced difficulties when they attempt to challenge FCC’s broadband availability data. For example, in 2013, all of the tribal entities that challenged FCC’s data on mobile service availability were unsuccessful in increasing the number of eligible areas. A few tribal stakeholders provided varying reasons for this, one of which was the need for more technical expertise to help the tribes meet FCC’s requirements regarding the information needed to support a challenge. Because FCC lacks a formal process to obtain tribal input on its broadband data, FCC is missing an important source of information regarding areas in which the data may overstate broadband service on tribal lands. By establishing a process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data as recommended in the National Broadband Plan, FCC could help tribes develop and share locally-specific information on broadband access and improve FCC’s data for tribal lands. However, the success of such an effort may rely on the tribes’ knowledge of, and technical ability to participate in, the process. Thus, we recommended FCC develop a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data that includes outreach and technical assistance to help tribes participate in the process. FCC agreed with this recommendation and stated that it will work with stakeholders to explore options for implementing such a process. Finally, some tribes face challenges accessing data from providers. In 2011, FCC required that providers receiving funds to serve tribal lands meaningfully engage with the tribes and discuss broadband deployment planning. In 2012, FCC issued guidance on meeting this requirement and stated that the guidance would evolve over time based on the feedback of both tribal governments and broadband providers. However, FCC has taken limited steps to obtain such feedback and has not updated the guidance. About half of the tribal stakeholders we interviewed raised concerns about difficulties accessing information from providers regarding broadband deployment on their tribe’s lands (which providers may consider proprietary), and some providers told us that they attempt to engage with tribes, but the level of responsiveness they receive from tribes varies. Thus, we recommended, and FCC agreed, that FCC obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers to determine whether it needs to clarify its tribal engagement guidance. In our September 2018 report on tribal partnerships, we found that partnership arrangements between tribes and other entities to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands are not widespread. Because of the greater costs associated with deploying broadband on unserved tribal lands that are generally rural, with possibly rugged terrain, there may be little to no private sector incentive to deploy broadband or enter into a partnership arrangement to do so. The partnership examples we identified were ones that obtained federal funding under past programs funded by the Recovery Act. Among these examples, tribes partnered with several different types of entities, including private providers, a community access network provider, an electric cooperative, a regional consortium, and tribally owned providers. We also reported in September 2018 that FCC and RUS are the primary sources of federal funding to deploy broadband infrastructure in rural and remote areas where the cost of providing service is high, including tribal lands. Based on our review of the funding provided by four federal programs targeted to increase deployment in unserved areas, very little has gone directly to tribes or to tribally owned broadband providers. Specifically, we found that from 2010 to 2017, less than 1 percent of FCC funding and about 14 percent of RUS funding went directly to tribes and tribally owned providers. Combined, FCC and RUS funding totaled $34.6 billion during that time period and tribes and tribally owned providers received $235 million, or about 0.7 percent. FCC’s 2010 National Broadband Plan stated that tribes needed substantially greater financial support than was available to them at the time and that accelerating tribal broadband deployment would require increased funding. Furthermore, the National Congress of American Indians expressed concerns that the needs for federally funded broadband projects are greater on tribal lands but tribes do not receive the appropriate share of federal funding aimed at increasing broadband deployment. Several of the tribes we visited told us they were trying to deploy broadband infrastructure or offer service because the private providers were not building out on their lands. Through our analysis, we found that from 2010 to 2017, 14 tribal entities received federal funding from FCC and RUS to increase broadband deployment (see fig. 2). The tribal officials, tribal associations, and tribally owned broadband providers we interviewed cited several barriers that tribes may face when seeking federal funding for broadband deployment. The two primary barriers these interviewees cited were (1) the statutory requirement for the eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) designation and (2) grant application requirements. Regarding the statutory requirement for ETC designation, FCC officials told us there were 11 tribes that have providers designated as ETCs and therefore would be eligible to receive support from FCC’s Connect America Fund (CAF)—the largest source of federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved and underserved areas. Although FCC adopted rules in 2011 to create CAF and modernize the program so that it could support broadband capable networks, FCC officials told us that most ETCs are the telephone companies that were in existence when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted into law. According to FCC officials, FCC has explored whether it has authority to allow non-ETC providers to receive CAF support payments but determined that the statute is clear that only ETCs can receive program support. Between 2012 and 2017, FCC officials said FCC received nine ETC applications, four of which were from tribally owned providers. Of those four, only one tribally owned provider was designated as an ETC. According to representatives from a tribal association we contacted, FCC has provided ETCs with billions of dollars to deploy service to unserved areas, but FCC’s efforts have not always been successful in the hardest to reach areas, particularly tribal lands. The representatives stated that FCC’s competitive market approach does not work where competition cannot be supported and that there needs to be a different approach. Similarly, tribal officials from Idaho told us that although the provider in their area has received millions of dollars in CAF subsidies, it has not deployed broadband on the tribal lands. Other tribal officials from Idaho told us that although private providers received CAF subsidies to deploy broadband service to their reservation, the private providers told the tribe it would be years before they offer service on tribal lands. Additionally, the tribal officials, tribal associations, and tribally owned broadband providers we interviewed said tribes may face barriers completing federal grant applications to obtain funding for broadband deployment. For example, they said tribes face regulatory barriers in applying for RUS’s grant funding, including preparing existing and proposed network design, demonstrating financial sustainability of the broadband project within 5 years, and obtaining matching funds. The National Broadband Plan recommended that federal agencies facilitate tribal access to broadband funding opportunities. Furthermore, recognizing the need to reduce barriers to expand broadband deployment, the Broadband Opportunity Council, established in March 2015, issued a memorandum stating that federal agencies should use all available and appropriate authorities to identify and address regulatory barriers that may unduly impede either broadband deployment or the infrastructure to augment broadband deployment. However, according to RUS officials, RUS has not taken steps to identify or address the barriers tribes face when applying for RUS grant funding due to limited resources and multiple competing priorities for those resources. We recommended that RUS identify any regulatory barriers that may unduly impede efforts by tribes to obtain RUS grant funds for broadband deployment on tribal lands and implement any steps necessary to address the identified barriers. By doing so, RUS could help tribes obtain funding to expand broadband deployment on tribal lands. RUS neither agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation.

Specifically, it addresses (1) the extent to which FCC’s approach to collecting broadband availability data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands, (2) the extent to which FCC obtains tribal input on the data, (3) partnerships tribes have formed with entities to deploy broadband infrastructure on tribal lands, and (4) barriers tribes face in obtaining federal funding. For these reports, GAO analyzed FCC and RUS data, and interviewed agency officials as well as a non-generalizable sample of stakeholders representing tribes and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) approach to collecting data on broadband availability causes it to overstate broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. In FCC’s approach, broadband is considered to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access on tribal lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. Most of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed stated FCC should work more directly with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC’s data.

The partnerships GAO identified included private providers, a community access network provider, an electric cooperative, a regional consortium, and tribally owned broadband providers. GAO reviewed four federal programs to deploy broadband services and found that from 2010 to 2017, less than 1 percent of funding has gone directly to tribes or tribally owned providers. The tribal entities GAO contacted cited barriers to obtaining funds from the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) grant funding, such as preparing network design, demonstrating financial sustainability of the broadband project within 5 years, and obtaining matching funds required to apply for federal grants. However, according to RUS officials, RUS has not taken steps to identify or address the barriers tribes face when applying for RUS grant funding due to limited resources and multiple competing priorities for those resources. By identifying and addressing regulatory barriers that may impede tribal entities’ access to RUS funding, RUS could help tribes obtain funding to expand broadband deployment on tribal lands.

{"input": "", "context": "The Social Security full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which workers can first claim full Social Security retired-worker benefits. Among other factors, the age at which an individual begins receiving Social Security benefits has an impact on the size of the monthly benefits. Claiming benefits before the FRA can substantially reduce monthly benefits, whereas claiming benefits after the FRA can lead to a substantial increase in monthly benefits. Benefit adjustments are made based on the number of months before or after the FRA the worker claims benefits. The adjustments are intended to result in roughly the same total lifetime benefits, regardless of when the worker claims benefits, based on average life expectancy. The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security in the 1930s. As part of legislation enacted in 1983, the FRA is increasing gradually from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period that started for those who turned age 62 in 2000. The increase in the FRA will be fully phased in (the FRA will reach 67) for workers born in 1960 or later (i.e., for workers who become eligible for retirement benefits at age 62 in 2022). For workers who become eligible for retirement benefits in 2019 (i.e., workers born in 1957), the FRA is 66 and 6 months. Workers can claim Social Security retired-worker benefits as early as age 62, the early eligibility age (EEA). However, workers who claim benefits before the FRA are subject to a permanent reduction in their benefits. Spouses can also claim reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62. Other types of dependents can claim benefits before the age of 62. Workers who claim benefits after the FRA receive a delayed retirement credit that results in a permanent increase in their monthly benefits. The credit applies up to the age of 70. Claiming benefits after attainment of age 70 does not result in any further increase in monthly benefits. The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security. According to Robert Myers, who worked on the creation of the Social Security program in 1934 and later served in various senior and appointed capacities at the Social Security Administration (SSA), \"[a]ge 65 was picked because 60 was too young and 70 was too old. So we split the difference.\" On the other hand, SSA suggests that the Committee on Economic Security (CES) made the proposal of 65 as the retirement age due to the prevalence of private and state pension systems using 65 as the retirement age and the favorable actuarial outcomes for 65 as the retirement age. In 1983, Congress increased the FRA as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which made major changes to Social Security's financing and benefit structure to address the system's financial imbalance at the time. Among other changes, the FRA was increased gradually from 65 to 67 for workers born in 1938 or later. Under the scheduled increases enacted in 1983, the FRA increases to 65 and 2 months for workers born in 1938. The FRA continues to increase by two months every birth year until the FRA reaches 66 for workers born in 1943 to 1954. Starting with workers born in 1955, the FRA increases again in two-month increments until the FRA reaches 67 for workers born in 1960 or later. The increase in the FRA, one of many provisions in the 1983 amendments designed to improve the system's financial outlook, was based on the rationale that it would reflect increases in longevity and improvements in the health status of workers. The 1983 amendments did not change the early eligibility age of 62 (discussed below); however, the increase in the FRA results in larger benefit reductions for workers who claim benefits between the age of 62 and the FRA. Table 1 shows the FRA by worker's year of birth under current law. Currently, the EEA is 62 for workers and spouses; this is the earliest age at which they can claim retirement benefits. Benefits claimed between age 62 and the FRA, however, are subject to a permanent reduction for \"early retirement.\" When the original Social Security Act was enacted in 1935, the earliest age to receive retirement benefits was the FRA (age 65). In 1956, the eligibility age was lowered from 65 to 62 for female workers, wives, widows, and female dependent parents. This was to allow wives, who traditionally were younger than their husbands, to qualify for benefits at the same time as their husbands. Benefits for female workers and wives were subject to reduction if claimed between the ages of 62 and 65; the reduction did not apply to benefits for widows and female dependent parents. In 1961, the eligibility age was lowered from 65 to 62 for men as well. Benefits for male workers and husbands were subject to reduction if claimed between the ages of 62 and 65; the reduction did not apply to widowers and male dependent parents. Although the eligibility age was made consistent for male and female workers, an inconsistency remained in the calculation of benefits. A man the same age as a woman needed more Social Security credits to qualify for benefits, and, if his earnings were identical to hers, usually received a lower benefit because his earnings were averaged over a longer period. This inconsistency was addressed in legislation enacted in 1972 which provided that retirement benefits would be computed the same way for men and women (the provision was fully effective for men reaching age 62 in 1975 or later). In subsequent years, further adjustments were made to the eligibility age for surviving spouses. The eligibility age was lowered to age 60 for widows (1965), age 50 for disabled widow(er)s (1967), and age 60 for widowers (1972). Benefits are adjusted based on the age at which a person claims benefits to provide roughly the same total lifetime benefits regardless of when a person begins receiving benefits, based on average life expectancy. The earlier a worker begins receiving benefits (before the FRA), the lower the monthly benefit will be, to offset the longer expected period of benefit receipt. Conversely, the longer a worker delays claiming benefits (past the FRA), the higher the monthly benefit will be, to take into account the shorter expected period of benefit receipt. The benefit adjustment is based on the number of months between the month the worker attains the FRA and the month he or she claims benefits. The day of birth is ignored for adjustment purposes, except for those born on the first of the month. Workers born on the first of the month base their FRA as if their birthday was in the previous month (e.g., someone born on February 1, 1980, who has an FRA of 67, can apply for full retirement benefits in January 2047). A calculator on SSA's website allows the user to enter his or her date of birth and the expected month of initial benefit receipt to see the effect of early or delayed retirement; the effect is shown as a percentage of the full benefit payable at the FRA. When a worker claims benefits before the FRA, there is an actuarial reduction in monthly benefits. The reduction for claiming benefits before the FRA can be sizable and it is permanent; all future monthly benefits are payable at the actuarially reduced amount. For each of the 36 months immediately preceding the FRA, the monthly rate of reduction from the full retirement benefit is five-ninths of 1%. This equals a 6⅔% reduction each year. For each month earlier than three years (36 months) before the FRA, the monthly rate of reduction is five-twelfths of 1%. This equals a 5% reduction each year. The earliest a worker can claim retirement benefits is age 62. For a worker with an FRA of 67, claiming benefits at 62 results in a 30% reduction in their monthly benefit. Table 2 shows the actuarial reduction applied to retired-worker benefits based on the FRA and the age at which benefits are claimed. Workers who claim benefits after the FRA receive a delayed retirement credit (DRC). As with the actuarial reduction for early retirement, the delayed retirement credit is permanent. The DRC has been modified over the years. Initially, the Social Security Amendments of 1972 provided a delayed retirement credit that increased benefits by one-twelfth of 1% for each month between ages 65 and 72 that a worker did not claim benefits (i.e., 1% per year). The credit, which was effective after 1970, applied only to the worker's benefit; it did not apply to a widow(er)'s benefit payable on the worker's record. The Social Security Amendments of 1977 increased the credit to 3% per year and included the credit in the computation of a widow(er)'s benefit. The credit was further increased under the Social Security Amendments of 1983. As shown in Table 3 , under current law, the amount of the credit varies based on the worker's year of birth (i.e., when the worker becomes eligible for benefits at age 62). The credit increases gradually until it reaches 8% per year (two-thirds of 1% per month) for workers born in 1943 or later (i.e., workers who became eligible for retirement benefits in 2005 or later). In addition, the maximum age at which the DRC applies was lowered from 72 to 70. Any further delay in claiming benefits past age 70 does not result in a higher benefit. The increase in the DRC was intended to ensure that workers who claim benefits after the FRA receive roughly the same total lifetime benefits as if they had claimed benefits earlier (based on average life expectancy). A worker with an FRA of 66, for example, receives a 32% benefit increase if he or she claims benefits at age 70; a worker with an FRA of 67 receives a 24% benefit increase. Figure 1 illustrates the effect of claiming age on benefit levels based on an FRA of 66. If the worker claims retirement benefits at age 62, for example, his or her benefit would be equal to 75% of the full benefit amount—a 25% permanent reduction based on claiming retirement benefits four years before attaining the FRA. If the worker delays claiming retirement benefits until age 70, however, his or her benefit would be equal to 132% of the full benefit amount—a 32% permanent increase for claiming benefits four years after the FRA. The decision to claim Social Security benefits before the FRA results in a permanent reduction in monthly benefits for early retirement. In addition, if a Social Security beneficiary is below the FRA and has current earnings, he or she is subject to the retirement earnings test (RET). Stated generally, Social Security benefits are withheld partially or fully, for one or more months, if current earnings exceed specified thresholds. There are two separate earnings thresholds (or exempt amounts ) under the RET. The first (lower) threshold applies to beneficiaries who are below the FRA and w ill not attain the FRA during the year. In 2019, the lower earnings threshold is $17,640. If a beneficiary has earnings that exceed the lower threshold, SSA withholds $1 of benefits for every $2 of earnings above the threshold. The second (higher) threshold applies to beneficiaries who are below the FRA and will attain the FRA during the year. In 2019, the higher earnings threshold is $46,920. If a beneficiary has earnings that exceed the higher threshold, SSA withholds $1 of benefits for every $3 of earnings above the threshold. The RET no longer applies beginning with the month the beneficiary attains the FRA. In other words, once the beneficiary attains the FRA, his or her benefits are no longer subject to withholding based on earnings. During the first year of benefit receipt, a special monthly earnings test applies. Regardless of the amount of annual earnings in the first year of benefit receipt, benefits are not withheld for any month in which earnings do not exceed a monthly exempt amount (the monthly exempt amount is equal to 1/12 of the annual exempt amount). In 2019, the monthly exempt amounts are $1,470 ($17,640/12) and $3,910 ($46,920/12). For example, consider a worker who claims benefits at age 62 in January 2019 and has no earnings during the year except for a consulting project that pays $20,000 in July. Although the beneficiary's annual earnings ($20,000) exceed the annual exempt amount ($17,640), benefits are withheld only for the month of July. The beneficiary has $0 earnings in all other months; July is the only month in which earnings exceed the monthly exempt amount ($1,470). Benefits withheld under the RET are not \"lost\" on a permanent basis. When a beneficiary attains the FRA and is no longer subject to the RET, SSA automatically recalculates the benefit, taking into account any months for which benefits were partially or fully withheld under the RET. Stated generally, there is no actuarial reduction for early retirement for any month in which benefits were partially or fully withheld under the RET. The recalculation results in a higher monthly benefit going forward. Starting at the FRA, the beneficiary begins to recoup the value of benefits withheld under the RET; the beneficiary recoups the full value of those benefits if he or she lives to average life expectancy. Statistics published by SSA show that a majority of retired-worker beneficiaries claim benefits before the FRA. Figure 2 shows the age distribution of new retired-worker beneficiaries in 2017. Among nearly 2.5 million new retired-worker beneficiaries that year, 37% claimed benefits at age 62 (the first year of eligibility) and 64% were under the age of 66. About one-fourth (23%) of new retired-worker beneficiaries claimed benefits at age 66, while 12% were age 67 or older. The percentage of retired-worker beneficiaries who claim benefits at earlier ages has declined in recent years. In 2010, for example, more than one-half (52%) of new retired-worker beneficiaries were age 62 and 81% were under the age of 66. The Social Security full retirement age was 65 when the program was established in the 1930s. It remained 65 until 1983, when Congress included an increase in the FRA among many provisions in the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which were designed to address serious near-term and long-range financing problems. The 1983 Amendments became law on April 20, 1983 . Without legislative action, it was anticipated that Social Security benefits could not be paid on time beginning in July 1983 . The 1983 provision that increased the FRA from 65 to 67 continues to be phased in; it will be fully phased in by 2022. The Social Security system once again faces projected long-range funding shortfalls. The Social Security Board of Trustees (the Trustees) projects that full Social Security benefits can be paid on time until 2034 with a combination of annual Social Security tax revenues and asset reserves held by the Social Security trust funds. After the projected depletion of trust fund reserves in 2034, however, annual tax revenues are projected to cover about three-fourths of benefits scheduled under current law. Over the years, many proposals have been designed to improve Social Security's financial outlook as well as achieve other policy goals. A common proposal is to increase the early eligibility age or further increase the full retirement age. As in the past, lawmakers who support increasing the retirement age point to gains in average life expectancy as an indicator that people can work until older ages. Those who oppose this type of policy change, however, point out that gains in life expectancy have not been shared equally across different segments of the population. They cite research showing that life expectancy is lower for individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES) compared to those with higher SES, and that the gap in life expectancy by SES has been growing over time. Differential gains in life expectancy are important in the context of Social Security. The actuarial adjustments to benefits for early or delayed retirement (i.e., for claiming benefits before or after the FRA) are based on average life expectancy. That is, the actuarial adjustments are designed to provide a person with roughly the same total lifetime benefits, regardless of the age at which he or she claims benefits, assuming the person lives to average life expectancy. Research has shown that differential gains in life expectancy have resulted in a widening gap in the value of lifetime Social Security retirement benefits between low earners and high earners. Over the years, deficit reduction commissions and other policymakers have recommended an increase in the Social Security retirement age. The recent proposals, for example, included the S.O.S. Act of 2016 ( H.R. 5747 , the 114 th Congress), which proposed increasing the FRA among other changes. Under the proposal, after the FRA reaches 67 for those attaining 62 in 2022, the FRA would increase by two months per year until the FRA reaches 69 for those attaining 62 in 2034. Thereafter, the FRA would increase one month every year. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) projects that this option would improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 39% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall (based on the 2018 Annual Report of the Social Security Board of Trustees, intermediate assumptions). Another recent proposal from the Bipartisan Policy Center in 2016 recommended, among other changes, to increase the FRA by one month every two years after the FRA reaches 67 for those attaining age 62 in 2022 until the FRA reaches 69, and also increase the age up to which the DRC may be earned at the same rate (from 70 to 72). This option contains no change in the EEA. OCACT estimates that this option would improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 19% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall (based on the 2018 Annual Report of the Social Security Board of Trustees, intermediate assumptions). In 2010, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (also called the Simpson-Bowles Commission after co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles) recommended increasing both the EEA and the FRA, among other Social Security changes. Under the commission's recommendations, after the FRA reaches 67 in 2027, both the EEA and the FRA would be indexed to increases in life expectancy. The commission estimated that the FRA would reach 68 by about 2050, and 69 by about 2075. The EEA would increase to 63 and 64 in step with increases in the FRA. OCACT estimates that this option would improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 15% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall. In conjunction with proposed increases in the EEA and FRA, the commission recommended policies that would provide people with more flexibility in claiming benefits. Specifically, the commission recommended allowing people to claim up to half of their benefits at age 62 (with an actuarial reduction) and the other half at a later age (with a smaller actuarial reduction). This option was intended to provide a smoother transition for those interested in phased retirement or for households where one member has retired and another continues to work. In general, it could provide a stream of income for those with financial difficulties by allowing them to claim a portion of their benefits early and avoid taking a permanent reduction on the full benefit amount. Recognizing that some workers may be physically unable to work beyond the current EEA (62) and may not qualify for Social Security disability benefits, the commission also recommended a hardship exemption for up to 20% of retirees. Under the proposal, as the EEA and FRA increase, certain beneficiaries could continue to claim benefits at age 62 and their benefits would not be subject to additional actuarial reductions. The commission specified that SSA would design the policy taking into consideration factors such as the physical demands of labor and lifetime earnings in developing eligibility criteria. Concerns regarding the effects of increasing the retirement age, especially on certain segments of the population, are not new. The Social Security Amendments of 1983, which increased the retirement age gradually from 65 to 67, mandated a study to examine the effects of increasing the retirement age on workers in physically demanding jobs or ill health. ", "answers": ["The Social Security full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which workers can first claim full Social Security retired-worker benefits. Among other factors, a worker's monthly benefit amount is affected by the age at which he or she claims benefits relative to the FRA. Benefit adjustments are made based on the number of months before or after the FRA the worker claims benefits. The adjustments are intended to provide the worker with roughly the same total lifetime benefits, regardless of when he or she claims benefits, based on average life expectancy. Claiming benefits before the FRA results in a permanent reduction in monthly benefits (to take into account the longer expected period of benefit receipt); claiming benefits after the FRA results in a permanent increase in monthly benefits (to take into account the shorter expected period of benefit receipt). The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security in the 1930s. Under legislation enacted in 1983, the FRA is increasing gradually from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period (for those reaching age 62 between 2000 and 2022). The FRA will reach 67 for workers born in 1960 or later (i.e., for workers who become eligible for retirement benefits at age 62 in 2022). Currently, the FRA is 66 and 6 months for workers who become eligible for retirement benefits in 2019 (i.e., workers born in 1957). Workers can claim reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62 (the early eligibility age). Spouses can also claim reduced retirement benefits starting at age 62. Other dependents, such as widow(er)s, can claim benefits at earlier ages. For workers with an FRA of 66, for example, claiming benefits at age 62 results in a 25% reduction in monthly benefits. For workers with an FRA of 67, claiming benefits at age 62 results in a 30% benefit reduction. A majority of retired-worker beneficiaries claim benefits before the FRA. In 2017, 37% of new retired-worker beneficiaries were age 62; almost two-thirds (64%) were under the age of 66. Workers who delay claiming benefits until after the FRA receive a delayed retirement credit, which applies up to the age of 70. For workers with an FRA of 66, for example, claiming benefits at age 70 results in a 32% increase in monthly benefits. For workers with an FRA of 67, claiming benefits at age 70 results in a 24% benefit increase. In 2017, almost one-fourth (23%) of new retired-worker beneficiaries were age 66; 12% were over the age of 66. Some lawmakers have called for increasing the Social Security retirement age in response to the system's projected financial imbalance, citing gains in life expectancy for the population overall. Other lawmakers, however, express concern that increasing the retirement age would disproportionately affect certain groups within the population, citing differences in life expectancy by socioeconomic groups. Differential gains in life expectancy are important in the context of Social Security because the actuarial adjustments for claiming benefits before or after the full retirement age are based on average life expectancy. Proposals to increase the retirement age are also met with concerns about the resulting hardship for certain workers, such as those in physically demanding occupations, who may be unable to work until older ages and may not qualify for Social Security disability benefits.

{"input": "", "context": "Cobra Dane and other radar systems can provide capabilities that contribute to a range of missions, such as ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence-gathering missions. DOD uses Cobra Dane and other radar systems to provide information over a short period of time to ground-based interceptors so they can hit their targets. Such radar systems contribute to ballistic missile defense by tracking incoming missile threats, classifying the missile threat, and determining if a threat was intercepted successfully. In addition, some radar systems can provide discrimination capabilities, which allow for that radar to identify a warhead when a missile threat deploys decoys at the same time. Radar systems can also have the capability to contribute to a space surveillance mission, which provides an awareness of space objects within or near the Earth’s orbit and their movements, capabilities, and intent. Finally, radars can also contribute intelligence-gathering capabilities. Each radar system’s ability to contribute to various missions can be dependent on that radar’s inherent capabilities and physical location. See table 1 for a description of selected radar systems that can provide some or all of these capabilities. Various offices within the Air Force, in coordination with MDA, are responsible for the operation and sustainment of the Cobra Dane radar. Since 2013, Air Force Space Command has overseen the operation of Cobra Dane, and contributes to the sustainment of Cobra Dane’s site at Shemya Island. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center has overall responsibility of the sustainment of the Cobra Dane radar. In addition, MDA works in coordination with the Air Force and combatant commands to develop, test, and field ballistic missile defense assets. MDA also shares funding with the Air Force to operate and sustain Cobra Dane. U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Strategic Command define priorities for the overall radar infrastructure and establish the various missions that those radar systems are intended to meet. U.S. Northern Command oversees the homeland ballistic missile defense mission, and establishes operational objectives for radar systems operating in its region. U.S. Northern Command officials told us that they are the end user for Cobra Dane. U.S. Strategic Command has established a ballistic missile defense and a space surveillance mission, both of which are supported by Cobra Dane. Further, U.S. Strategic Command’s components coordinate global missile defense and space operations planning. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force described how Cobra Dane and LRDR can meet mission requirements through their shared and unique capabilities, as well as how their locations affect their ability to provide those capabilities for DOD’s ballistic missile defense mission. MDA studies we reviewed found that locating LRDR at Clear Air Force Station allows for operational advantages and cost savings. The Air Force included information in its report to Congress on the ballistic missile defense capabilities of Cobra Dane and LRDR, and the effects of each radar’s location on those capabilities. Specifically, the Air Force report stated that both radars have the capabilities to track and classify missile threats. However, the report incorrectly stated that both radar systems have the inherent capability to determine if a missile threat is successfully intercepted. MDA documentation that we reviewed shows that Cobra Dane does not yet have this capability. When we shared our finding with Air Force and MDA officials, they agreed that this reported capability was incorrectly identified in the Air Force report to Congress. MDA officials also told us that Cobra Dane could provide this capability in the future if it implements software changes, but they are unlikely to do this until calendar year 2025. The Air Force report also noted that LRDR would have a unique capability, once it is operational, to discriminate missile threats from any deployed decoys. See table 2 for a summary of what the Air Force reported for the ballistic missile defense capabilities of Cobra Dane and LRDR. In addition to identifying ballistic missile defense capabilities of each radar, the Air Force report noted that both Cobra Dane and LRDR will have the inherent capabilities to support space surveillance and intelligence-gathering missions. DOD officials we spoke to confirmed that they have plans to use those inherent capabilities to support these other missions. For example, U.S. Strategic Command identified that DOD needs Cobra Dane to support its space surveillance mission. Further, Air Force and MDA officials told us that they use Cobra Dane to track small objects that no other radar system can track. MDA officials told us that LRDR could be used for space surveillance. However, Air Force and U.S. Strategic Command officials stated that there are no plans to use LRDR’s space surveillance capabilities as a replacement for Cobra Dane. Additionally, Air Force officials told us that neither Cobra Dane nor LRDR is required to support an intelligence-gathering mission. The Air Force also included information in its report on how the locations of Cobra Dane and LRDR affect their abilities to contribute to the ballistic missile defense mission. For example, the Air Force reported that Cobra Dane’s location at Shemya Island, Alaska, allows it to track missile threats from North Korea earlier in their trajectories than LRDR would be able to track at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska. This is consistent with an MDA analysis that we reviewed that outlined additional advantages provided by Cobra Dane’s location at Shemya Island. According to that analysis, Cobra Dane can begin tracking missile threats approximately 210 seconds earlier than LRDR. Air Force officials told us that the additional time to track missile threats allows the warfighter an earlier opportunity to intercept a missile threat and deploy additional interceptors if the first attempt fails. Further, the MDA analysis described a tracking gap between the areas covered by LRDR—once it is operational at Clear Air Force Station—and the two sets of AN/TPY-2 radars that are currently located in Japan. Without Cobra Dane’s coverage of this gap, the analysis found that the warfighter would have a more limited opportunity to intercept a missile threat from North Korea. Figure 2 shows how Cobra Dane covers a gap between the LRDR (once operational) and the two AN/TPY-2 radars in Japan. The Air Force report also noted that LRDR’s geographic location has its own advantages in contributing to ballistic missile defense compared to Cobra Dane’s location. For example, the Air Force report noted that LRDR’s location would allow it to track missile threats later in their trajectories beyond Cobra Dane’s coverage as those threats make their way to the continental United States. We also found that MDA has determined LRDR will have other advantages due to its location. For example, an MDA analysis that we reviewed found that LRDR’s location will allow for the radar system to contribute to ballistic missile defense from North Korean and Iranian threats. Absent LRDR, this analysis determined that there are no other radar systems that are located in a position to provide the capability to discriminate missile threats and determine if a threat was successfully intercepted. In addition to what the Air Force reported, we found that DOD decided to locate LRDR at Clear Air Force Station in Alaska after considering the advantages and disadvantages of other locations. For example, MDA completed studies that examined how LRDR could perform at various locations in Alaska, and the cost-effectiveness of constructing and sustaining the radar at those sites. In a June 2015 analysis, MDA compared how LRDR could perform in discriminating missile threats when co-locating it with Cobra Dane at Shemya Island or placing it at Clear Air Force Station. MDA determined that LRDR could provide more real-time discrimination information for missile threats targeting Alaska and the continental United States if it constructed the radar at Clear Air Force Station versus Shemya Island. Additionally, MDA identified in an October 2016 study that the department could obtain operational advantages and cost savings by constructing LRDR at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska, when compared to constructing it at Shemya Island, Alaska. Specifically, MDA determined that Clear Air Force Station could provide better results for 11 of the 13 factors it reviewed compared to Shemya Island. For example, MDA determined that locating LRDR at Clear Air Force Station would result in lower costs and enhanced system performance. According to DOD officials and documents we reviewed, other radar investments may reduce the department’s reliance on Cobra Dane for ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, given that U.S. Northern Command identified it has a need for Cobra Dane after DOD begins operating LRDR in fiscal year 2021. Specifically, the Pacific Radar and Space Fence may reduce DOD’s reliance on Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, respectively. Pacific Radar: According to DOD officials, the department may no longer need Cobra Dane to meet the ballistic missile defense mission after MDA fields a new radar in the Pacific region in fiscal year 2025. MDA began developing the Pacific Radar to provide additional missile threat tracking and discrimination capabilities. According to U.S. Northern Command and MDA officials, the Pacific Radar may fill the gap in tracking missile threats currently covered by Cobra Dane. Space Fence: The Air Force has also determined it will no longer have a requirement for Cobra Dane to provide space surveillance once the Space Fence is fully operational. The Air Force plans for the Space Fence to be operational in fiscal year 2019. According to a U.S. Strategic Command briefing, the Space Fence will provide the same capabilities as Cobra Dane. Air Force officials noted that they want to continue relying on Cobra Dane for space surveillance when the Space Fence is operational, as long as the radar is available and used to contribute to ballistic missile defense. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability—i.e., the percentage of time that the radar system is able to meet its ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. Specifically, the Air Force report noted that Cobra Dane had been available an average of 91 percent of the time over a 2-year period (January 2016 through December 2017), which exceeded the 90 percent requirement for operational availability. Information that we reviewed from a more recent 2-year period (August 2016 through July 2018) showed that Cobra Dane’s 2-year average for operational availability had declined to approximately 88 percent—below the 90 percent requirement. Air Force officials stated that the decline in the operational availability over the more recent two-year period was due to a few instances where they needed to take Cobra Dane off-line for extended periods of scheduled downtime (e.g., regular operations and maintenance, calibration of instruments). Further, they noted that when Cobra Dane is not operationally available, the reason is usually due to scheduled downtime. Officials also told us there was one instance of unscheduled downtime (e.g., part or system failure) in that 2-year period which required emergency maintenance on the radar’s mission control hardware. We also reviewed Air Force data on the frequency of unscheduled downtime between August 2016 and July 2018, which show that Cobra Dane is able to contribute to its missions without unscheduled downtime 99.7 percent of the time. According to U.S. Northern Command and MDA officials, they can mitigate the effect on the ballistic missile defense mission if they know far enough in advance that Cobra Dane will not be operationally available— such as during scheduled downtime. Officials stated that they do this by moving a transportable radar, known as the Sea-Based X-band radar, to specific locations in the Pacific Ocean to provide additional tracking coverage of missile threats. A U.S. Northern Command analysis that we reviewed describes how DOD can deploy the Sea-Based X-band radar at particular locations in the Pacific Ocean to supplement Cobra Dane. This analysis found that U.S. Northern Command can lose the ability to track some missile threat trajectories if Cobra Dane is not available and the Sea-Based X-band radar is not deployed. We also reviewed Air Force data on space surveillance, which shows that the Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to complete its space surveillance mission when Cobra Dane is not operationally available. According to the data, Cobra Dane tracks 3,300 space objects each day that cannot be tracked by any other radar system. Air Force officials noted that when Cobra Dane is not operationally available for space surveillance for short periods (less than 24 hours), they can overcome that downtime without losing track of those unique objects. However, officials told us that it would take six months to reacquire all of the small space objects that Cobra Dane tracks, if they encounter any significant scheduled or unscheduled downtime. MDA officials told us there are no scheduled plans to take Cobra Dane down long enough to compromise DOD’s ability to conduct space surveillance. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force projected that the Air Force and MDA would contribute total funding of $278.6 million based on their fiscal year 2019 budget plans for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. According to the report, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar, and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Table 3 outlines the plan for how the Air Force and MDA will share funding for the operation and maintenance of Cobra Dane. In addition, the Air Force included information in its report on how the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding to support Cobra Dane’s three modernization projects. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to redesign parts for three sets of obsolete systems: (1) mission system replacement; (2) traveling wave tubes; and (3) transmitter groups. The Air Force has identified that it no longer has vendors that manufacture some critical parts, and failure of any of the three systems could result in Cobra Dane not being available to meet mission requirements. As such, the Air Force determined that it could sustain these three systems more effectively if they were redesigned. Table 4 summarizes the reported funding for the three projects that make up the Cobra Dane sustainment plan. In addition to what the Air Force reported, we identified that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for its transmitter group replacement, but not for its other two projects. For the other two projects, Air Force officials stated that they plan to complete estimates for the total costs in conjunction with their fiscal year 2020 budget submission. In August 2016, the Air Force estimated that the transmitter group replacement would have a total cost of $91.2 million, but reported it would fund this project at $94.0 million through fiscal year 2023 (see table 4). Air Force officials plan to request the transfer of any unused funding to the other projects once it completes the transmitter group project. The Air Force also completed a partial cost estimate for the traveling wave tube redesign—covering the redesign of the parts and replacement of 1 of 12 groups of parts—estimating that the first phase would cost $16.0 million. Further, Air Force officials told us that they have not yet developed a total cost estimate for the mission system replacement. We also found that the Air Force and MDA expedited Cobra Dane’s mission system replacement project, but Air Force officials told us they face challenges in expediting the other two projects without compromising Cobra Dane’s operational availability. For the mission system replacement, MDA requested additional funding in fiscal year 2018. Air Force and MDA officials told us that the additional funding they received allowed them to prioritize the mission system replacement and advance its timeline earlier that year. Air Force officials stated that they explored ways to expedite the two other projects: the traveling wave tubes and transmitter groups. However, they stated that replacing too many parts at the same time will result in their having to take Cobra Dane off-line for longer periods of time. According to Air Force and MDA officials, they may look for opportunities to expedite timeframes for their other two projects as long as the amount of scheduled downtime is kept to acceptable levels. In its report to Congress, the Air Force identified that it plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane’s site at Shemya Island based on its fiscal year 2019 budget plans. According to the report, the Air Force is solely responsible for funding all work related to the operation and sustainment of Shemya Island, shared between two of its major commands: Air Force Space Command and Pacific Air Forces. Table 5 summarizes the information the Air Force included in its report on how funding will be shared for Shemya Island. We also reviewed a support agreement between Air Force Space Command and Pacific Air Forces that identifies how they will sustain the site and the calculation for sharing costs. The agreement describes the specific work to sustain the site, including maintaining the airfield, support facilities, and communication infrastructure. Air Force officials told us that they are constantly addressing challenges related to operational access to the site at Shemya Island, but Air Force Space Command and Pacific Air Forces work together to address those challenges. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. DOD told us that it had no comments on the draft report. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions and Sustainment; the Secretary of the Air Force; the Director of the Missile Defense Agency; and the Commanders of U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Strategic Command.

Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects. Air Force officials plan to complete cost estimates for those two projects in conjunction with their fiscal year 2020 budget submission."], "length": 3607, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b404ba909fd6c4404b7e997d659e1be7bc9ce80d469de3f0"}
{"input": "", "context": "This report provides responses to frequently asked questions about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. It is intended to serve as a quick reference to provide easy access to information and data. Appendix B presents a series of tables with state-level data. This report does not provide information on TANF program rules (for a discussion of TANF rules, see CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements , by Gene Falk). On January 24, 2019, the President signed legislation ( P.L. 116-4 ) that funds TANF and related programs through June 30, 2019. The legislation permits states to receive their quarterly TANF grants for the 2 nd quarter (January through March) and 3 rd quarter (April through June) of FY2019. Additional legislation would be required to pay TANF grants in the final quarter (July through September) of FY2019. TANF programs are funded through a combination of federal and state funds. In FY2018, TANF has two federal grants to states. The bulk of the TANF funding is in a basic block grant to the states, totaling $16.5 billion for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Indian tribes. There is also a contingency fund available that provides extra federal funds to states that meet certain conditions. Additionally, states are required to expend a minimum amount of their own funds for TANF and TANF-related activities under what is known as the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. States are required to spend at least 75% of what they spent in FY1994 on TANF's predecessor programs. The minimum MOE amount, in total, is $10.3 billion per year for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA, P.L. 104-193 ). A TANF basic block grant amount—both nationally and for each state—was established in the 1996 welfare reform law. The amount established in that law for the 50 states, District of Columbia, territories, and tribes was $16.6 billion in total. From FY1997 through FY2016, that amount remained the same. It was not adjusted for changes that occur over time, such as inflation, the size of the TANF assistance caseload, or changes in the poverty population. During this period, the real (inflation-adjusted) value of the block grant declined by one-third (33.1%). Beginning with FY2017, the state family assistance grant was reduced by 0.33% from its historical levels to finance TANF-related research and technical assistance. The reduced block grant amount is $16.5 billion. Table 1 shows the state family assistance grant, in both nominal (actual) and real (inflation-adjusted) dollars for each year, FY1997 through FY2018. In real (inflation-adjusted) terms, the FY2018 block grant was 36% below its value in FY1997. Figure 1 shows the uses of federal TANF grants to states and state MOE funds in FY2017. In FY2017, a total of $31.1 billion of both federal TANF and state MOE expenditures were either expended or transferred to other block grant programs. Basic assistance—ongoing benefits to families to meet basic needs—represented 23% ($7.1 billion) of total FY2017 TANF and MOE dollars. TANF is a major contributor of child care funding. In FY2017, $5 billion (16% of all TANF and MOE funds) were either expended on child care or transferred to the child care block grant (the Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF). TANF work-related activities (including education and training) were the third-largest TANF and MOE spending category at $3.3 billion, or 11% of total TANF and MOE funds. TANF also helps low-wage parents by helping to finance state refundable tax credits, such as state add-ons to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). TANF and MOE expenditures on refundable tax credits in FY2017 totaled $2.8 billion, or 9% of total TANF and MOE spending. TANF is also a major contributor to the child welfare system, which provides foster care, adoption assistance, and services to families with children who either have experienced or are at risk of experiencing child abuse or neglect, spending about $2.2 billion on such activities. TANF and MOE funds also help fund state prekindergarten (pre-K) programs, with total FY2017 expenditures for that category also at $2.5 billion. TANF and MOE funds are also used for short-term and emergency benefits and a wide range of other social services. For state-specific information on the use of TANF funds, see Table B-1 and Table B-2 . TANF law permits states to \"reserve\" unused funds without time limit. This permits flexibility in timing of the use of TANF funds, including the ability to \"save\" funds for unexpected occurrences that might increase costs (such as recessions or natural disasters). At the end of FY2017 (September 30, 2017, the most recent data currently available), a total of $5.1 billion of federal TANF funding remained neither transferred nor spent. However, some of these unspent funds represent monies that states had already committed to spend later. At the end of FY2017, states had made such commitments to spend—that is, had obligated—a total of $1.8 billion. At the end of FY2017, states had $3.3 billion of \"unobligated balances.\" These funds are available to states to make new spending commitments. Table B-3 shows unspent TANF funds by state. This number is not known. Federal TANF reporting requirements focus on families receiving only ongoing assistance . There is no complete reporting on families receiving other TANF benefits and services. Assistance is defined as benefits provided to families to meet ongoing, basic needs. It is most often paid in cash. However, some states use TANF or MOE funds to provide an \"earnings supplement\" to working parents added to monthly Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) allotments. These \"earnings supplements\" are paid separately from the regular TANF cash assistance program. Additionally, TANF MOE dollars are used to fund food assistance for immigrants barred from regular SNAP benefits in certain states. These forms of nutrition aid meet an ongoing need, and thus are considered TANF assistance. As discussed in a previous section of this report, TANF basic assistance accounts for about 24% of all TANF expenditures. Therefore, the federal reporting requirements that pertain to families receiving \"assistance\" are likely to undercount the number of families receiving any TANF-funded benefit or service. Table 2 provides assistance caseload information. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. For state-by-state assistance caseloads, see Table B-4 . Figure 2 provides a long-term historical perspective on the number of families receiving assistance from TANF or its predecessor program, from July 1959 to September 2017. The shaded areas of the figure represent months when the national economy was in recession. Though the health of the national economy has affected the trend in the cash assistance caseload, the long-term trend in receipt of cash assistance does not follow a classic countercyclical pattern. Such a pattern would have the caseload rise during economic slumps, and then fall again during periods of economic growth. Factors other than the health of the economy (demographic trends, policy changes) also have influenced the caseload trend. The figure shows two periods of sustained caseload increases: the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s and a second period from 1988 to 1994. The number of families receiving assistance peaked in March 1994 at 5.1 million families. The assistance caseload fell rapidly in the late 1990s (after the 1996 welfare reform law) before leveling off in 2001. In 2004, the caseload began another decline, albeit at a slower pace than in the late 1990s. During the recent 2007-2009 recession and its aftermath, the caseload began to rise from 1.7 million families in August 2008, peaking in December 2010 at close to 2.0 million families. By September 2018, the assistance caseload had declined to 1.2 million families. Table B-5 shows recent trends in the number of cash assistance families by state. Before PRWORA, the \"typical\" family receiving assistance has been headed by a single parent (usually the mother) with one or two children. That single parent has also typically been unemployed. However, over the past 20 years the assistance caseload decline has occurred together with a major shift in the composition of the rolls. Figure 3 shows the change in the size and composition of the assistance caseload under both AFDC (1988 and 1994) and TANF. In FY1988, an estimated 84% of AFDC families were headed by an unemployed adult recipient. In FY2016, families with an unemployed adult recipient represented 32% of all cash assistance families. This decline occurred, in large part, as the number of families headed by unemployed adult recipients declined more rapidly than other components of the assistance caseload. In FY1994, a monthly average of 3.8 million families per month who received AFDC cash assistance had adult recipients who were not working. In FY2016, a monthly average of 485,000 families per month had adult recipients or work-eligible individuals, with no adult recipient or work-eligible individual working. With the decline in families headed by unemployed adults, the share of the caseload represented by families with employed adults and \"child only\" families has increased. In FY2017, families with all adult recipients unemployed and families with employed adult recipients each represented 31% of all assistance families. The latter category includes families in \"earnings supplement\" programs separate from the regular TANF cash assistance program. \"Child-only\" families are those where no adult recipient receives benefits in their own right; the family receives benefits on behalf of its children. The share of the caseload that was child-only in FY2017 was 38%. In FY2017, families with a nonrecipient, nonparent relative (grandparents, aunts, uncles) represented 14% of all assistance families. Families with ineligible, noncitizen adults or adults who have not reported their citizenship status made up 9% of the assistance caseload in that year. Families where the parent received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and the children received TANF made up 9% of all assistance families in FY2017. There are no federal rules that help determine the amount of TANF cash benefits paid to a family. (There are also no federal rules that require states to use TANF to pay cash benefits, though all states do so.) Benefit amounts are determined solely by the states. Most states base TANF cash benefit amounts on family size, paying larger cash benefits to larger families on the presumption that they have greater financial needs. The maximum monthly cash benefit is usually paid to a family that receives no other income (e.g., no earned or unearned income) and complies with program rules. Families with income other than TANF often are paid a reduced benefit. Moreover, some families are financially sanctioned for not meeting a program requirement (e.g., a work requirement), and are also paid a lower benefit. Figure 4 shows the maximum monthly TANF cash benefit by state for a single mother caring for two children (family of three) in July 2016. The benefit amounts shown are those for a single-parent family with two children. For a family of three, the maximum TANF benefit paid in July 2017 varied from $170 per month in Mississippi to $1,201 per month in New Hampshire. The map shows a regional pattern to the maximum monthly benefit paid, with lower benefit amounts in the South than in other regions. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states, rather than individual recipients. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. The TANF statute requires states to have 50% of their caseload meet standards of participation in work or activities—that is, a family member must be in specified activities for a minimum number of hours. There is a separate participation standard that applies to the two-parent portion of a state's caseload, requiring 90% of the state's two-parent caseload to meet participation standards. However, the statutory work participation standards are reduced by a \"caseload reduction credit.\" The caseload reduction credit reduces the participation standard one percentage point for each percentage point decline in a state's caseload. Additionally, under a regulatory provision, a state may get \"extra\" credit for caseload reduction if it spends more than required under the TANF MOE. Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% and 90% targets, and vary by state and by year. States that do not meet the TANF work participation standard are at risk of being penalized through a reduction in their block grant. However, penalties can be forgiven if a state claims, and the Secretary of HHS finds, that it had \"reasonable cause\" for not meeting the standard. Penalties can also be forgiven for states that enter into \"corrective compliance plans,\" and subsequently meet the work standard. The 50% and 90% target standards that states face, as well as the caseload reduction credit, date back to the 1996 welfare reform law. However, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) made several changes to the work participation rules effective in FY2007 The caseload reduction credit was changed to measure caseload reduction from FY2005, rather than the original law's FY1995. The work participation standards were broadened to include families receiving cash aid in \"separate state programs.\" Separate state programs are programs run with state funds, distinct from a state's \"TANF program,\" but with expenditures countable toward the TANF MOE. HHS was instructed to provide definition to the allowable TANF work activities listed in law. HHS was also required to define what is meant by a \"work-eligible\" individual, expanding the number of families that are included in the work participation calculation. States were required to develop plans and procedures to verify work activities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ), a law enacted in response to the sharp economic downturn of 2007-2009, held states \"harmless\" for caseload increases affecting the work participation standards for FY2009 through FY2011. It did so by allowing states to \"freeze\" caseload reduction credits at pre-recession levels through the FY2011 standards. HHS computes two work participation rates for each state that are then compared with the effective (after-credit) standard to determine if it has met the TANF work standard. An \"all-families\" work participation rate is computed and compared with the all-families effective standard (50% minus the state's caseload reduction credit). HHS also computes a two-parent work participation rate that is compared with the two-parent effective standard (90% minus the state's caseload reduction credit). Figure 5 shows the national average all-families work participation rate for FY2002 through FY2017. For the period FY2002 through FY2011, states achieved an average all-families work participation rate hovering around 30%. The work participation rate increased since then. In FY2016, it exceeded 50% for the first time since TANF was established. However, it is important to note that the increase in the work participation rate has not come from an increase in the number of recipients in regular TANF assistance programs who are either working or in job preparation activities. This increase stems mostly from states creating new \"earnings supplement\" programs that use TANF funds to aid working parents in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) or who have left the regular TANF assistance programs for work. Figure 6 shows which states did not meet the TANF all-families work participation standards from FY2006 through FY2017. Before FY2007, the first year that DRA was effective, only a few jurisdictions did not meet TANF all-families work participation standards. However, in FY2007, 15 jurisdictions did not meet the all-families standard. This number declined to 9 in FY2008 and 8 in FY2009. In FY2012, despite the uptick in the national average work participation rate, 16 states did not meet the all-family standard, the largest number of states that did not meet their participation standards in any one year since the enactment of TANF. FY2012 was the year that ARRA's \"freeze\" of the caseload reduction credit expired, and states were generally required to meet higher standards than in previous years. The number of jurisdictions that did not meet the all-families standard declined over the FY2012 to FY2017 period. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. In addition to meeting a work standard for all families, TANF also imposes a second standard—90%—for the two-parent portion of its cash assistance caseload. This standard can also be lowered by caseload reduction. Figure 7 shows whether each state met its two-parent work participation standard for FY2006 through FY2017. However, the display on the table is more complex than that for reporting whether a state met or did not meet its \"all family\" rate. A substantial number of states have reported no two-parent families subject to the work participation standard. These states are denoted on the table with an \"NA,\" indicating that the two-parent standard was not applicable to the state in that year. Before the changes made by the DRA were effective, a number of states had their two-parent families in separate state programs that were not included in the work participation calculation. When DRA brought families receiving assistance in separate state programs into the work participation rate calculations, a number of states moved these families into solely state-funded programs. These are state-funded programs with expenditures not countable toward the TANF maintenance of effort requirement, and hence are outside of TANF's rules. For states with two-parent families in their caseloads, the table reports \"Yes\" for states that met the two-parent standard, and \"No\" for states that did not meet the two-parent standard. Of the 28 jurisdictions that had two-parent families in their FY2017 TANF work participation calculation, 19 met the standard and 9 did not. Appendix A. Supplementary Tables Appendix B. State Tables", "answers": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds a wide range of benefits and services for low-income families with children. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 3556, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "32ad6299b8d6ce84c15670ba9487d9222e69cefbdf035cee"}
{"input": "", "context": "Federal law generally requires the Secretary of State to convene an ARB not later than 60 days after the occurrence of an incident that resulted in serious injury, loss of life, or significant destruction of property at, or related to, a U.S. mission abroad unless the Secretary determines the incident clearly involves only causes unrelated to security. This time period can be extended for an additional 60-day period if the Secretary determines that the additional period is necessary for the convening of the board. Whenever the Secretary convenes an ARB, the Secretary shall promptly inform the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Federal law specifies that an ARB will consist of five members appointed by the Secretary of State and one appointed by the Director of National Intelligence. It also states that the ARB shall submit its findings to the Secretary of State. According to State’s FAM, the ARB is a mechanism to foster more effective security of U.S. missions and personnel abroad by ensuring a thorough and independent review of security-related incidents. Through its investigations and recommendations, the ARB seeks to determine accountability and promote and encourage improved security programs and practices. M/PRI—the central management analysis organization of State’s Under Secretary of State for Management—is responsible for initiating and shepherding the incident vetting process to identify incidents that may warrant an ARB, according to the FAM. The FAM states that M/PRI will begin the ARB incident vetting process once M/PRI becomes aware of an incident abroad that could involve loss of life, injury, or destruction of property. This process includes consultation with the Office of the Legal Adviser (Legal), DS, and other offices as appropriate to evaluate whether the ARB statute criteria apply. If the ARB statute criteria are deemed applicable or if the applicability is questionable, M/PRI is responsible for calling a meeting of State’s ARB Permanent Coordinating Committee. See figure 1 for members of the Permanent Coordinating Committee and other State offices and bureaus involved in responding to the incidents in Cuba. If M/PRI decides the ARB statute criteria are not applicable, M/PRI will notify committee members in writing, providing a summary of the incident and an explanation as to why the criteria do not apply. If any member disagrees, M/PRI will call a Permanent Coordinating Committee meeting. According to the FAM, the committee will review the available facts and recommend to the Secretary of State whether or not to convene an ARB as quickly as possible after an incident occurs. The Secretary of State makes the final decision on whether to convene an ARB. WHA, DS, and MED, among other State entities, support the U.S. Embassy in Havana by providing advice and guidance on policy, security, and other issues. WHA. Reporting to the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, WHA oversees the U.S. Embassy in Havana and is responsible for managing and promoting U.S. interests in the region. Embassy officials, including senior leadership, report to WHA and its Office of the Coordinator for Cuban Affairs through diplomatic cables, email, and phone calls. DS. Reporting to the Under Secretary of State for Management, DS oversees security at diplomatic posts and is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. Embassy Regional Security Officers are required to report security incidents through different systems, including diplomatic cables, SPOT Reports, or the Security Incident Management Analysis System, depending on the type of incident. Regional Security Officers are also in regular contact with DS via phone and email, according to State officials. MED. Reporting to the Under Secretary of State for Management, MED ensures that U.S. government employees and their families who are assigned to diplomatic posts have access to healthcare and advises State management about health issues around the world. The U.S. Embassy in Havana has a medical unit, including U.S. direct-hire and locally hired staff. MED approves requests to medically evacuate U.S. personnel and family members from diplomatic posts. Other State entities. Other State entities provide support to the U.S. embassy in Havana on specific issues. For example, CMS, within State’s Executive Secretariat, gathers, assesses, and disseminates information to State senior management about events that threaten the security of U.S. missions and their personnel. The Office of Foreign Missions, which reports to the Under Secretary of State for Management, seeks fair treatment for U.S. personnel abroad while ensuring that foreign diplomats based in the United States receive the same treatment that their respective governments provide to U.S. personnel abroad in return. Although M/PRI is responsible for initiating and leading State’s ARB incident vetting process, State’s ARB policy does not define how M/PRI should become aware of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. Regarding Cuba, the U.S. embassy and several State entities responded to incidents that were later associated with various injuries in early 2017. As of June 2018, State officials remained uncertain of the cause or perpetrator of the incidents and injuries. M/PRI officials said they did not know about the incidents in Cuba until August 2017, when the media began to report on the incidents. Although M/PRI is responsible for initiating and leading the ARB incident vetting process, State’s polices do not define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. According to the FAM, M/PRI and the Permanent Coordinating Committee are responsible for evaluating whether incidents meet the ARB statute criteria. However, M/PRI can only initiate the process after it is made aware of potentially qualifying incidents, and the FAM does not outline how M/PRI should be notified of these types of incidents or which, if any, State entities are responsible for notifying M/PRI. In contrast, the FAM outlines other specific reporting responsibilities for Regional Security Officers. According to State officials and our analysis, State’s FAM and Foreign Affairs Handbooks do not establish a policy, procedure, or process for internal communication of such incidents to M/PRI. In 2006, the Under Secretary of State for Management issued a cable requiring U.S. diplomatic posts to report potential ARB incidents directly to M/PRI. However, the cable did not identify who at post was responsible for reporting, and instructed posts to report to an individual who is no longer in M/PRI. Moreover, State officials we met with were unaware of the cable. M/PRI officials said that information about potentially qualifying incidents is not directed to them through State’s established reporting mechanisms, such as diplomatic cables. State’s cable system does not have a caption, channel, or tag that would direct information to M/PRI about incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or damage to property. State’s Office of the Inspector General previously found deficiencies in State’s internal communication of incidents that may meet ARB criteria. Despite the 2006 cable on potential ARB incident reporting, in 2013, State’s Inspector General found that State had no systematic process ensuring immediate notification of security-related incidents to M/PRI, and that DS did not routinely provide security reports to M/PRI. The Inspector General made an informal recommendation that DS should include M/PRI as an addressee on all security-related incident reports. In 2015, the Inspector General noted that DS, in response to the recommendation, said that such a blanket inclusion of M/PRI on all security-related incident reports would result in M/PRI being inundated with a large number of irrelevant reports. Because State has no policy that ensures M/PRI becomes aware of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property, M/PRI officials said they typically become aware of potentially qualifying incidents—such as explosions at diplomatic facilities—when such incidents are discussed internally and widely publicized. M/PRI officials also told us they occasionally became aware of potentially qualifying incidents through informal communication, such as during senior staff meetings with the Under Secretary of State for Management. If M/PRI officials are not aware of incidents, they cannot initiate State’s ARB incident vetting process. This situation puts State at risk of not meeting statutory time frames for convening an ARB and could result in State being unable to improve security programs and practices at other U.S. diplomatic posts, which could affect the response to similar incidents elsewhere. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for internal communication to achieve the entity’s objectives and note that management should document responsibilities through policy. The FAM requires internal controls, which includes as an objective that programs are efficiently and effectively carried out in accordance with applicable law and management policy. The FAM also states that the Under Secretary of State for Management is responsible for, among other things, developing and executing management policies; the organization, operations, and assignment of functions within State; and directing and administering worldwide information resources. In January 2017, U.S. embassy and State officials began responding to incidents in Cuba that were later associated with various injuries. In June 2018, the Secretary of State noted that the precise nature of the injuries and the cause had not yet been established. According to congressional testimony by State officials, in late 2016, U.S. personnel in Havana first reported incidents, typically involving sounds and resulting in various medical symptoms, to the embassy’s Regional Security Officer and Chief of Mission. Embassy officials reported the incidents to DS and the National Security Council as a new type of harassment in early January 2017, according to State documents. The embassy’s Medical Officer first evaluated a U.S. official related to the incidents on December 30, 2016, and others in January 2017. Starting in late March 2017, the embassy held several meetings with U.S. personnel to share the limited information it had about the incidents, according to State officials. In April 2017, the embassy held Emergency Action Committee meetings regarding the incidents. CMS communicated with State senior management about the incidents beginning in April 2017. To ensure that State senior management were aware of how the embassy was responding, CMS distributed among various State entities, including M/PRI, one of the embassy’s April 2017 diplomatic cables reporting on an Emergency Action Committee meeting. According to CMS officials, the cable that CMS distributed was unclear about what incidents had occurred and did not include detailed information about the incidents or associated injuries. According to M/PRI officials, M/PRI was on CMS’s distribution list because M/PRI was responsible for monitoring the implementation of a previous ARB recommendation that called for State to review embassy risk management decisions. According to a former M/PRI official, M/PRI did not review these CMS communications for other purposes, including to identify incidents that may meet ARB statute criteria. In addition, in April and May 2017, CMS included multiple cables on the situation in Cuba in its daily Safety Overseas Summary for State senior management. In response to the incidents, U.S. embassy and WHA officials met with Cuban officials to emphasize to the Cuban government its responsibilities to ensure the safety of foreign diplomats in Cuba, according to testimony by State officials. In mid-February 2017, U.S. officials met with Cuban officials in Havana and Washington, D.C., about the incidents, citing the Vienna Convention requirements to provide for the safety and security of diplomats, according to State officials. Following additional incidents reported in March and April 2017, U.S. officials met again with Cuban officials in Havana and Washington, D.C. In May 2017, State expelled two Cuban diplomats from the United States to underscore the Cuban government’s responsibility to protect U.S. personnel in Cuba, according to testimony by State officials. In September 2017, State ordered the departure from Cuba of non-emergency U.S. embassy personnel and, in October, expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington, D.C. to underscore to Cuba its obligations to protect U.S. personnel, according to testimony by State officials. According to State officials, by May 2017, the embassy, WHA, DS, and MED were aware of 16 U.S. personnel and family members in Havana who had been injured, although unable to determine the cause. In January 2018, State’s Medical Director testified to Congress that by May 1, 2017, State had determined that several of those individuals had serious injuries. Between February and May 2017, a specialist at the University of Miami evaluated 80 members of the embassy community. MED arranged for the medical evacuations of about 40 U.S. personnel from Cuba to Miami, Florida, for evaluations with the specialist, and the specialist subsequently conducted additional evaluations at the embassy in Havana. According to State testimony to Congress, the specialist identified 16 individuals who had symptoms and medically verifiable clinical findings similar to mild traumatic brain injury. In June 2018, the Secretary of State noted that the precise nature of the injuries and the cause had not yet been established. M/PRI officials said they became aware of the incidents in Cuba after media reports in August 2017. According to M/PRI officials, a State official—who previously worked in M/PRI—contacted M/PRI in early August after seeing media reports to inquire whether they were aware of the incidents in Cuba. Although several State entities were aware of the incidents, WHA, DS, and MED did not report the incidents to M/PRI and it was unclear whether the incidents met the criteria for convening an ARB, according to officials. However, our analysis shows that State’s policies do not instruct State entities to evaluate whether incidents meet the ARB criteria before reporting such incidents to M/PRI. Instead, State’s FAM requires M/PRI to lead the process for evaluating incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. According to the FAM, M/PRI will call a Permanent Coordinating Committee meeting if the ARB statute criteria apply or if the applicability is questionable. The committee will, as quickly as possible after an incident occurs, review the available facts and recommend to the Secretary whether to convene an ARB. M/PRI initiated State’s incident vetting process in August 2017, as shown in figure 2 below. As a result of the incidents in Cuba, M/PRI officials told us they realized that they may not be aware of all incidents that may involve injury to U.S. diplomats. In an initial attempt to address this concern, M/PRI officials said they requested that CMS add M/PRI officials to the distribution list for the Safety Overseas Summary to try to increase M/PRI’s awareness of potential incidents. CMS told us that it added M/PRI officials to the distribution list in October 2017. According to M/PRI officials and a timeline provided by M/PRI, once these officials became aware of the incidents in August 2017, the office began the ARB incident vetting process, as described in the FAM. In August 2017, these officials initially consulted with DS and MED about the incidents. In further discussion with Legal, the officials determined that they did not have sufficient information to determine whether the incidents met the ARB statute criteria. Given the uncertainties surrounding the incidents, in mid-September 2017, they decided to call a meeting of the Permanent Coordinating Committee, which included representatives from M/PRI, WHA, DS, MED, Legal, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the Bureau of Counterterrorism, and the Intelligence Community. The committee initially met on September 28, 2017, to review the available facts against the ARB statute criteria, and concluded that it needed additional time to determine whether the ARB statute criteria had been met. On November 28, 2017, the committee met again and recommended to the Secretary of State that an ARB be convened. The Secretary of State concurred with the recommendation on December 11, 2017, and convened the ARB on January 12, 2018. The ARB officially began its work in early February 2018. An ARB is intended to result in improved security programs and practices at U.S. missions abroad. While State has directed M/PRI to initiate the incident vetting process—including convening the Permanent Coordinating Committee to evaluate the facts—State’s policies do not define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property at U.S. missions abroad. Although M/PRI officials may receive information through informal channels, this approach does not ensure that M/PRI will be made aware of relevant incidents. With regard to the incidents in Cuba, M/PRI could not begin the incident vetting process for determining whether the ARB statute criteria had been met until it became aware of them in August 2017. When M/PRI is not aware of incidents that may meet the ARB statute criteria, it cannot initiate the incident vetting process for convening ARBs. Until State establishes policies that ensure the appropriate office is promptly aware of potentially relevant incidents—for example, policies that identify formal internal communication procedures and document responsibilities for such communication—State is at risk of failing to comply with the ARB statute. Improving its security programs at U.S. diplomatic posts is all the more imperative given recent reports of similar incidents, such as in Guangzhou, China. To ensure that State’s process allows it to initiate its ARB incident vetting process in a timely manner, the Secretary of State should revise State’s policies to define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property at, or related to, U.S. missions abroad. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to State. In its written comments, State concurred with our recommendation. State said it will improve its processes for ensuring effective internal communication. We have reprinted State’s comments in their entirety in appendix I. State also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of State. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

Over State has reported that over 20 U.S. diplomats and family members in Havana have suffered from medical conditions believed to be connected to the incidents, which began in late 2016 and have continued into 2017. By law, State is generally required to convene an ARB within 1260 days of incidents that result in serious injury at, or related to, a U.S. mission abroad, but the Secretary of State can determine that a 60 day extension is necessary. According to State's policy, M/PRI is responsible for initiating and leading State's ARB incident vetting process. This report is part of a broader request to review State's response to the incidents in Cuba. In this report, GAO examines the extent to which State's ARB policy ensures that M/PRI is made aware of incidents that may meet the ARB statute criteria. GAO analyzed relevant federal laws, State policies, and other State documents. GAO also interviewed cognizant State officials. The Department of State's (State) Accountability Review Board (ARB) policy does not ensure that the responsible office—State's Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing, and Innovation (M/PRI)—is made aware of incidents that may meet the ARB statute criteria, such as those that occurred in Cuba and were associated with injuries to U.S. personnel. According to State policy, as soon as M/PRI becomes aware of potentially qualifying incidents, M/PRI will start the process for considering whether the incident warrants an ARB. M/PRI relies on informal communication to identify potentially qualifying incidents to begin the vetting process because State does not have a policy, procedure, or process for internal communication of such incidents to M/PRI, according to State officials and GAO analysis. As illustrated in the figure below, other State entities began responding to the incidents in early 2017, but M/PRI was not made aware of the incidents until mid-August 2017, when a former M/PRI official contacted the office after seeing media reports. If M/PRI is not aware of incidents, it cannot initiate State's ARB incident vetting process. This situation puts State at risk of not meeting statutory time frames for convening an ARB and could result in State being less able to improve security programs and practices at other U.S. diplomatic posts. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for internal communication to achieve the entity's objectives and note that management should document responsibilities through policy. GAO recommends that State revise its policies to define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of relevant incidents. State concurred with GAO’s recommendation."], "length": 3503, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9a51004402fbc478d05aae259cf5dddb70821aedbc62d7b2"}
{"input": "", "context": "According to the Director of HSWL, who was appointed to the position in August 2015, financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks led the Coast Guard’s Executive Oversight Council to decide to terminate the IHiS project in October 2015: Financial risks. Internal investigations were initiated in January 2015 and May 2015 to determine whether the HSWL Directorate had violated the Antideficiency Act by using incorrect funding sources and incorrect fiscal year funds for the IHiS project. The Coast Guard ordered project management and contractor staff to cease work on IHiS until a determination was made regarding the antideficiency violation. Technical risks. IHiS lacked an independent security assessment and full interface testing to ensure security and data integrity. In addition, key functionality for the system, such as user verification, had not been completed. Schedule risks. The HSWL Director stated that she requested that the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Defense Health Agency Solution Delivery Information Technology (IT) team independently validate the IHiS timelines and the status of the project in 2015 because of the identified technical risks and concerns as to whether the system would be ready to be piloted in the fall of 2015. According to the Director, the Defense Health Agency team projected the timeline for the first clinic implementation to be approximately 1 year later than originally estimated due, in part, to incomplete interfaces and workflows. Personnel risks. Although HSWL staff had been managing the IHiS project since it was initiated in 2010, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Technology (C4&IT) was directed to assume the oversight responsibilities for IHiS implementation in May 2015. This action was due to concerns about the project’s adherence to established governance processes raised by the internal investigators looking into the potential Antideficiency Act violations. By August 2015, the key HSWL project management personnel that had overseen the project since 2010 had been removed. As a result of the changes in staff, one vendor noted that it was unclear as to who were the stakeholders, responsible parties, and decision makers. According to an analysis conducted by the Coast Guard, which included obligations and expenditures from September 2010 to August 2017, the agency had obligated approximately $67 million for the IHiS project and, of that amount, had spent approximately $59.9 million at the time of its cancelation. In addition, over 2 years after the project’s cancelation, the Coast Guard continued to pay vendors. In this regard, it paid approximately $6.6 million to vendors between November 2017 and February 2018 to satisfy existing contractual obligations for services such as leased equipment that was damaged or missing; software licensing and support; a data storage center; and removal and shipment of equipment. Further, according to staff in Coast Guard’s Office of Budget and Programs, no equipment or software from the IHiS project could be reused for future efforts. The Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it effectively managed and oversaw the IHiS project prior to its discontinuance, and did not document and share valuable lessons learned from the failed project. Specifically, although the Coast Guard was to follow its System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Practice Manual to guide its management and oversight of the project, the agency could not provide complete evidence that it had addressed 15 of the 30 SDLC practices we selected for evaluation. For example, the Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it had conducted IHiS system testing, although the agency granted an authority to operate (ATO) and indicated in the ATO memorandum that the system had undergone some form of testing. The Coast Guard’s SDLC specifies that system testing is to take place prior to the issuance of an ATO. Project team members provided inconsistent explanations regarding whether or not documentation existed to demonstrate the actions taken to manage and oversee the project. The absence of the various documents and other artifacts that would support the required SDLC activities raises doubts that the Coast Guard took the necessary and appropriate steps to ensure effective management of the IHiS project. Further, although the Coast Guard developed charters for various governance boards to provide project oversight and direction, the boards were not active and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) was not included as a member of the boards. Taking steps to fully implement governance boards that include the CIO will be important to the Coast Guard’s oversight efforts in implementing a future EHR system and may decrease the risk of IT project failure. Lastly, although Coast Guard officials stated that lessons learned had been identified throughout the process of developing IHiS, as of 2 years after its cancelation, the agency had not documented and shared any lessons learned from the project and did not have established plans for doing so. Until the Coast Guard takes steps to document and share identified lessons learned with individuals charged with developing and acquiring its IT systems, opportunities to protect future systems against the recurrence of mistakes that contributed to the failure of IHiS will likely be missed. In the absence of an EHR system, the Coast Guard is relying on a predominately paper health record management process to document health care services for its nearly 50,000 military members. Currently, the Coast Guard’s clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each paper health record. For example, clinical staff schedule appointments for patients using Microsoft Outlook’s calendar feature and provide the patient with paper forms for completion upon his or her arrival. In addition, clinical staff must handwrite clinical notes in the paper health record during the appointment, as well as handwrite prescriptions, among other manual processes. In response to our survey, the 12 HSWL Regional Managers identified a number of challenges that clinics and sick bays in their regions had experienced in managing and maintaining paper health records. These challenges were grouped into 16 categories. Further, the 120 clinic and sick bay administrators that subsequently responded to a separate survey reported varying degrees to which they viewed each category as challenging. Figure 1 provides the clinic and sick bay respondents’ views of the top four challenges. With regard to these top four challenges to managing and maintaining paper health records, clinic and sick bay respondents offered the following examples: Incomplete records. Ninety-eight (82 percent) of the respondents reported incomplete records as challenging. In this regard, 34 of the survey respondents reported that not all records from the Coast Guard legacy EHR systems were printed out and included in patients’ paper health records as required before the systems were retired. Thus, they had no way to ensure the patients’ paper records were complete. Penmanship. Among the 91 (76 percent) survey respondents that reported penmanship as challenging, several respondents noted that it is difficult for staff to read illegible handwritten medical notes. This, in turn, results in difficulty determining the accurate diagnosis, the required prescription, or a referral. Tracking medications. According to 89 (76 percent) of the respondents, it is challenging to track medications without an EHR. For example, one administrator stated that staff members rely heavily on patients to remember what medications they are taking—potentially causing harm if patients cannot remember what medications they are taking and the medications have dangerous interactions. Amount of time to manage records. According to 86 (72 percent) of the respondents, managing paper health records is challenging and requires more time for staff to complete and file paperwork. Several respondents stated that the size of the paper health records has increased, resulting in additional time required to review and file records. The responding clinic and sickbay administrators described a range of alternative work-around processes that they have developed to help alleviate several of the challenges. Specifically, they reported having developed additional forms, tracking methods, and alternative processes, as well as having notified Coast Guard HSWL management of the challenges they face. However, these alternative processes may not provide sustained solutions to overcoming these challenges. Until Coast Guard implements a new EHR solution, the challenges inherent in a predominantly paper process will likely remain. The Coast Guard has begun taking steps to acquire a new EHR system referred to as the Electronic Health Record Acquisition (eHRa). The Coast Guard plans to manage and oversee the acquisition of eHRa through its non-major acquisition process (NMAP), as described in its Non-Major Acquisition Process (NMAP) Manual. NMAP requires formal approval reviews at three discrete knowledge points called acquisition decision events (ADE) and includes three phases to assess the readiness and maturity of the acquisition. The Coast Guard formally identified the need for a new EHR system on February 1, 2016, and obtained approval for the first of three ADE’s on February 13, 2016. It subsequently initiated market research activities by collecting cost, schedule, and capabilities information from commercial and government solution providers, including DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Coast Guard used the providers’ responses to develop an alternatives analysis report that was completed in October 2017. The report recommended a solution based on performance, risk, cost, and schedule advantages. The report indicated that the Coast Guard plans to use the results of the alternatives analysis to refine the acquisition strategy, and to support the development of artifacts which are required to successfully achieve the ADE-2 milestone. Staff within the Acquisitions Directorate stated that they were also in the process of finalizing a life cycle cost estimate and a project plan for eHRa—documents necessary for ensuring that appropriate business decisions will be made regarding eHRa’s logistics, affordability, and resources, among other things. As of December 2017, the Coast Guard had not yet made a final determination as to which option would be chosen as the solution for the eHRa acquisition. Our report that is being released today contains four recommendations to the Coast Guard. Specifically, we recommend that the Coast Guard: expeditiously and judiciously pursue the acquisition of a new EHR ensure established processes required for the future acquisition or development of an EHR are effectively implemented and adequately documented; direct the Chief Information Officer and the Chief Acquisition Officer to establish and fully implement project governance boards for the future EHR effort that include the Chief Information Officer; and document any lessons learned from the discontinued IHiS project, share them with the new project management team, and ensure lessons learned are utilized for the future EHR effort. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with our four recommendations and identified actions being taken or planned to implement them. If the Coast Guard fully and effectively implements our recommendations, many of the challenges faced by its clinics and sick bays and the thousands of Coast Guard members utilizing its health services could be diminished. In summary, given the numerous challenges inherent with managing and maintaining paper health records, it will be important for the Coast Guard to prioritize obtaining an EHR for its thousands of members. Until a solution for its EHR system is chosen and successfully implemented, the agency is likely to continue to face these challenges. In addition, ensuring established project management and governance processes are effective, as well as documenting and sharing lessons learned, will be essential in avoiding past mistakes and helping to ensure a successful implementation of a future EHR solution at the Coast Guard.

However, in October 2015, the Coast Guard announced that the modernization project would be canceled. GAO was asked to summarize its report that is being released today on the Coast Guard's actions related to its EHR modernization initiative. GAO's testimony specifically addresses Coast Guard's (1) reasons for deciding to terminate further IHiS development; (2) management and oversight actions for the discontinued project and whether lessons learned were identified; (3) current process for managing health records and the challenges it is encountering; and (4) plans for effectively implementing a new EHR system and the current status of its efforts. In preparing the report on which this testimony is based, GAO reviewed IHiS project expenditures; analyzed key project management documentation; surveyed Coast Guard's Regional Managers and clinical staff; and interviewed key staff. Financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks led to the United States Coast Guard's (Coast Guard) decision to terminate the Integrated Health Information System (IHiS) project in 2015. According to the Coast Guard (a military service within the Department of Homeland Security), as of August 2017, $59.9 million was spent on the project over nearly 7 years and no equipment or software could be reused for future efforts. In addition, the Coast Guard could not fully demonstrate the project management actions taken for IHiS, lacked governance mechanisms, and did not document lessons learned for the failed project. In the absence of an electronic health record (EHR) system, the Coast Guard currently relies on a predominately paper health record management process to document health care services. Currently, the Coast Guard's clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each paper health record. Coast Guard Regional Managers and clinic and sick bay administrators informed GAO of the many challenges encountered in returning to a paper process. These challenges include the inability for some clinics to adequately track vital information such as medications—potentially causing harm to members if they take medications that have dangerous interactions. To help alleviate several of these challenges, the Coast Guard has developed alternative work-around processes. However, these alternative processes may not provide sustained solutions to overcoming these challenges. In February 2016, the Coast Guard initiated the process for acquiring a new EHR system. As of November 2017, agency officials had conducted research and recommended a solution based on performance, risk, cost, and schedule advantages. However, 2 years after canceling IHiS and moving toward a predominately manual process, the agency has not yet made a final determination on this. Successfully and quickly implementing an EHR system is vital to overcoming the challenges the Coast Guard currently faces in managing paper health records. The expeditious implementation of such a system can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of care to the thousands of Coast Guard active duty and reserve members that receive health care. In the report being released today, GAO is recommending that the Coast Guard (1) expeditiously and judiciously pursue a new EHR system, and in doing so (2) ensure key processes are implemented; (3) establish project governance boards; and (4) document lessons learned from the IHiS project.

{"input": "", "context": "Over the past decade, the federal government has expanded financial assistance to public and private stakeholders for preparedness activities through various grant programs administered by DHS through its component agency, FEMA. Through these grant programs, DHS has sought to enhance the capacity of states, localities, and other entities, such as ports or transit agencies, to prevent, respond to, and recover from a natural or manmade disaster, including terrorist incidents. Two of the largest preparedness grant programs are the State Homeland Security Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative. The State Homeland Security Program provides funding to support states’ implementation of homeland security strategies to address the identified planning, organization, equipment, training, and exercise needs at the state and local levels to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events. FEMA allocated $402 million for the program in fiscal year 2017. The Urban Areas Security Initiative provides federal assistance to address the unique needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas, and assists the areas in building an enhanced and sustainable capacity to prevent, protect, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism. FEMA allocated $580 million for the program in fiscal year 2017. The State Homeland Security Program (SHSP), awarded to the nation’s 56 states and territories, and the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI), awarded to urban areas based on DHS’s risk assessment methodology, are the largest of the preparedness grant programs, accounting for about 60 percent of Fiscal Year 2017 grant funding. See figure 1 for a history of funding levels for these programs. Eligible candidates for the FY 2017 UASI program are determined through an assessment of relative risk of terrorism faced by the 100 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, in accordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended. In February 2016, we reported that FEMA has taken some steps, but has not fully addressed longstanding preparedness grant management coordination challenges between its headquarters and regional offices. We found that for several preparedness grant programs, FEMA headquarters staff in GPD and regional staff share management and monitoring responsibilities. For example, we found that assessments by GPD and others since 2009 had recommended that regional offices, rather than headquarters offices, be responsible for managing and monitoring preparedness grants to avoid confusion and duplication, and to strengthen coordination with state and local grantees. Further, in July 2011, we found that GPD had efforts underway to regionalize grant management responsibilities and improve coordination of preparedness grants, and that these efforts were consistent with internal control standards. However, GPD officials reported that in 2012 it changed course and decided to continue sharing grant management roles between headquarters and regions, referred to as a hybrid grant management structure. GPD officials told us that they changed course because, among other things, estimates that the costs of regionalization would be greater than the annual savings FEMA identified in an earlier study and concerns that inconsistent program implementation would occur across the regions, and outweighed the potential benefits. GPD officials at that time said they had taken steps to address coordination challenges associated with this hybrid grant management structure. However, we found in February 2016 that these challenges continue. For example, states and FEMA regional officials told us that GPD staffs in headquarters and regions did not always coordinate their monitoring visits, which can be disruptive to the state emergency management agency’s day-to-day operations. FEMA regional officials also reported that GPD staffs in headquarters and regions sometimes provided inconsistent guidance to grantees. Further, while GPD officials identified some steps they plan to take to address the challenges, we found that GPD lacked a plan with time frames and goals for addressing them. We recommended that FEMA develop a plan with time frames, goals, metrics, and milestones detailing how GPD intends to resolve longstanding challenges associated with its existing hybrid grants management model, which divides responsibilities between regional and headquarters staff. FEMA, however, did not concur with our recommendation, stating that it disagreed with our characterization of longstanding challenges in managing preparedness grants. As we stated in the report, multiple assessments dating back to 2009 have reported challenges with the hybrid model. As also noted in our report, officials from four FEMA regional offices and officials from three states within those regions provided various examples of a lack of coordination between headquarters and regional staff in managing preparedness grants, including instances that took place in 2014 and as recently as September 2015. In October 2017, FEMA developed a plan—the Milestone Action Plan—to track efforts aimed at improving coordination issues associated with its hybrid grants management model, as we recommended in February 2016. The plan divides responsibilities for the management of preparedness grants between regional and headquarters staff and describes completed, ongoing, and planned efforts taken by FEMA to improve grants management coordination along with steps taken, goals, and time frames, among other things. For example, the plan shows that FEMA developed and finalized the Monitoring Actions Tracker in August 2016, a tool shared by GPD in FEMA headquarters and staff in regional offices. Through the tracker, GPD headquarters and regional staffs are able to view planned and completed monitoring activities related to grants management, as well as the status of any open corrective actions. In addition to developing the Milestone Action Plan, FEMA officials described other efforts taken to improve coordination issues. For example, FEMA officials told us they increased the use of an online collaboration tool, which allows for instant information sharing between GPD and the regions. By taking these steps, FEMA should be better positioned to track and evaluate efforts to improve regional coordination, as we recommended in 2016. FEMA has been delayed in addressing the need for improved coordination among grant programs identified in our prior work. Specifically, we found in February 2012 that multiple factors contribute to the risk of duplication among four FEMA preparedness grant programs— the State Homeland Security Program, Urban Areas Security Initiative, Port Security Grant Program, and Transit Security Grant Program—as these programs share similar goals, fund similar projects, and provide funds in the same geographic regions. Further, we found that DHS’s ability to track grant funding, specific funding recipients, and funding purposes varies among the programs, giving FEMA less visibility over some grant programs. Also, DHS’s award process for some programs based allocation decisions on high-level, rather than specific, project information, which could further contribute to the risk of duplication. Although our February 2012 analysis identified no cases of duplication among a sample of grant projects, the above factors collectively put FEMA at risk of funding duplicative projects. As a result, in 2012, we included these challenges in our annual report on duplication, overlap, and fragmentation in federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives. FEMA has not yet taken action to fully address our concerns. We recommended in February 2012 that as FEMA developed its new grants management information system (the Non-Disaster Grants Management System, or ND Grants at that time), that the agency collect project information with the level of detail needed to better position the agency to identify any potential unnecessary duplication within and across the four grant programs. In December 2012, FEMA officials reported that the agency intended to start collecting and analyzing project-level data from grantees in fiscal year 2014. Further, in December 2017, FEMA took actions to identify potential unnecessary duplication across four preparedness grant programs, as we recommended in February 2012. Although the development of FEMA’s grants management information system is ongoing, FEMA issued guidance and adopted interim processes to help identify potential duplication across these preparedness grant programs until the system’s capabilities are upgraded over the next several years. For example, in fiscal year 2014, FEMA modified a legacy grants data system to capture more robust project-level data—such as project budget data—for the Homeland Security Grant Program, which includes the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative. In addition, in fiscal year 2017, FEMA procured a software visualization tool and developed a set of standard operating procedures to assist staff in identifying potentially duplicative projects. Specifically, the visualization tool will use grants award data from the Port Security Grant Program, the Transit Security Grant Program, and compare the grant programs named above to highlight ZIP codes that contain multiple projects. These projects will then be analyzed by FEMA officials. According to the standard operating procedure, if duplication is suspected within a particular geographic area, further collaborative reviews should be conducted in coordination with the Office of Chief Counsel to determine appropriate remedies. Using an interim approach to collect more specific project-level data during the grant application process and utilizing the new software visualization tool should help FEMA strengthen the administration and oversight of its grant programs until FEMA implements its long-term solution for the agency’s grants management information system. In the area of performance assessment, we reported in June 2013 on limitations in FEMA’s ability to validate the performance data it collects. Specifically, we found that two of FEMA’s preparedness grant programs—Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPG) and Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) programs—collect performance information through a variety of reporting mechanisms but face challenges in identifying verifiable program outcomes. These reporting mechanisms collect performance data used by FEMA regional offices and headquarters for different purposes. For example, headquarters focuses on the development of future program priorities and on reporting progress toward the National Preparedness Goal, while regions use program information to monitor primary grant recipients for compliance. DHS developed agency priority goals that reflect agency-wide, near-term priorities. According to FEMA officials, the EMPG and AFG programs have an indirect link to a DHS agency priority goal, as well as the National Preparedness Goal, because they support states’ level of preparedness for disasters. According to FEMA officials, neither program has a standardized tool with which to validate the performance data that are self-reported by recipients; additionally, the regions are inconsistent in their approaches to verifying program performance data. We concluded that the absence of a formal established validation and verification procedure, as directed by the Office of Management and Budget’s Circular No. A-11, could lead to the collection of erroneous performance data. In our June 2013 report, we recommended that FEMA ensure that there are consistent procedures in place at the headquarters’ office and regional level to ensure verification and validation of grant performance data that allow the agency to attest to the reliability of EMPG and AFG grant data used for reporting progress toward goals. DHS concurred with our recommendation and stated that FEMA would explore effective and affordable ways to verify and validate EMPG and AFG grant performance data. In April 2015, FEMA officials reported that FEMA was in the process of developing the data verification and validation checks of EMPG grantee performance reporting. For example, according to FEMA officials, they have revised reporting templates and uniform table definitions to make it easier for grantees to submit accurate, complete, and consistent information on programmatic activities such as the completion of training and exercise requirements. However, these processes have not yet been fully implemented, and FEMA officials have not yet provided similar tools and checklists for the AFG program. In March 2017, FEMA grants management staff provided us with documentation on the process FEMA uses to verify and validate grantee data from the EMPG and AFG grant programs, as we recommended. As a result of having a consistent approach to verifying data, FEMA’s efforts should reduce the collection of erroneous performance data. In addition, as part of our September 2016 review of FEMA Fire Assistance Grant program, we reported that FEMA officials said they planned to develop and implement a consolidated grant management system to integrate data used to manage fire grant programs with the data gathered for FEMA’s other preparedness grants, and ultimately better measure the impact of fire grants on national preparedness efforts. Specifically, as we reported in May 2016, FEMA plans to develop and implement a new Grants Management Modernization system to provide agency-wide management for all of FEMA’s disaster and preparedness grants. Further, we are currently performing an on-going review of FEMA’s consolidated grant management system and plan to report on this effort later this year. We also reported in March 2011 that FEMA needed to improve its oversight of preparedness grants by establishing a framework with measurable performance objectives for assessing urban area, state, territory, and tribal capabilities to identify gaps and prioritize investments. Specifically, we recommended that FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding. With such an assessment, FEMA could identify the potential costs for establishing and maintaining capabilities at each level and determine what capabilities federal agencies should provide. We reported in March 2013 that FEMA has made some progress in assessing its preparedness capabilities, but continued to face challenges developing a national preparedness system that could assist FEMA in prioritizing preparedness grant funding. For example, in March 2012, FEMA issued the first National Preparedness Report, which describes progress made to build, sustain, and deliver capabilities. In April 2012, FEMA issued guidance on developing Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments (THIRA) to facilitate the self-assessments of regional, state, and local capabilities. FEMA requires state, territory, tribal, and urban area governments receiving homeland security funding to annually complete THIRAs and use the results to determine the resources required to achieve the capability targets they set for their jurisdiction. However, we found in March 2013 that FEMA faced challenges that may reduce the usefulness of these efforts. For example, the National Preparedness Report noted that while many programs exist to build and sustain preparedness capabilities, challenges remain in measuring their progress over time. According to the report, in many cases, measures do not yet exist to gauge the performance of these programs, either quantitatively or qualitatively. FEMA has taken some steps to address our recommendation. Specifically, FEMA reported in February 2018 that the agency has developed capability-specific performance objectives that will enable a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps, but no such report has been issued at this time. FEMA reported that it plans on implementing new methodology for some core capabilities in December 2018 and for all core capabilities by December 2019, and will be able to provide complete results in 2020. In addition, FEMA reported that they are developing a new Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) methodology that will assist in measuring the effectiveness of state and urban areas’ grant projects in reducing risk. According to FEMA, the new methodology will measure changes in state and urban area preparedness through the use of standardized capability targets and key indicators that will show how FEMA preparedness grants are being used to address gaps in capability targets. This should also lead to a better understanding of the Nation’s overall preparedness. Regardless, as of February 2018, FEMA had taken steps to assess preparedness capabilities, but had not yet completed a national preparedness assessment with clear, objective, and quantifiable capability requirements against which to assess preparedness, as we recommended. Developing such an assessment would help FEMA to identify what capability gaps exist at the federal level and what level of resources are needed to close such gaps.

According to DHS, the department has awarded over $49 billion to a variety of DHS preparedness grant programs from fiscal years 2002 through 2017, to enhance the capabilities of grant recipients. For example, the State Homeland Security Program which awards grants to the nation's 56 states and territories, and the Urban Areas Security Initiative which awards grants to urban areas based on DHS's risk methodology, are the largest of the preparedness grant programs (see figure). This statement addresses progress and challenges in FEMA's efforts to manage preparedness grants and GAO's prior recommendations to strengthen these programs. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from March 2011 through February 2016 and selected updates conducted in December 2017 through April 2018. To conduct the prior work and updates, GAO analyzed relevant FEMA data and documentation and interviewed relevant officials. In February 2012, GAO identified coordination challenges among Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant programs that share similar goals and fund similar projects, which contribute to the risk of duplication among the programs. GAO recommended that FEMA take steps, as it develops its new grant management system, to collect project information with sufficient detail to identify potential duplication among the grant programs. FEMA has since addressed these recommendations. Specifically, in 2014, FEMA modified a legacy grants data system to capture more robust grant project-level data, and in fiscal year 2017, procured a software tool and developed a set of standard operating procedures to assist its staff in identifying potentially duplicative projects. These actions should help FEMA strengthen the administration and oversight of its grant programs. Furthermore, FEMA is also developing a new grants management modernization system to consolidate and better manage its grants. GAO is currently reviewing the system for this Committee and will report out next year. GAO reported in March 2011 on the need for FEMA to improve its oversight of preparedness grants by establishing a framework with measurable performance objectives for assessing urban area, state, territory, and tribal capabilities to identify gaps and prioritize investments. Specifically, GAO recommended that FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding. FEMA has taken some steps to address GAO's prior recommendation. Specifically, in February 2018, FEMA reported developing capability-specific performance objectives that will enable a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps. However, FEMA plans to finalize these efforts in 2020 and it is too early to tell how this will impact grant allocations. Until these efforts are completed, GAO will not be able to determine the extent that they address past challenges and recommendations. GAO has made prior recommendations designed to address the challenges discussed in this statement. FEMA has taken actions to address some but not all of these recommendations."], "length": 3706, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f7270d5ce192416ef3845ebae55ed10a991b3f99e12ddd0a"}
{"input": "", "context": "A range of federal incentives supports the development and deployment of alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation. These incentives include tax deductions and credits for vehicle purchases and the installation of refueling systems, federal grants for conversion of older vehicles to newer technologies, mandates for the use of biofuels, and incentives for manufacturers to produce alternative fuel vehicles. Some of these incentives have expired in recent years when their authorizations expired. Many of the policy choices presented for alternative fuel and advanced vehicle technologies originated as a response to the nation's interest in reducing petroleum imports, a goal first articulated at the time of the two oil embargoes imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the 1970s. While President Richard Nixon is often cited as the first President to call for \"energy independence,\" successive Presidents and Congresses have made efforts to reduce petroleum import dependence as well. As shown in Figure 1 , since peaking in 2005, net U.S. oil imports have fallen by 70%. Factors in this reversal include the last recession, which reduced domestic demand, followed by a rise in the supply of U.S. oil and oil alternatives due to increased private sector investment and federal incentives, some of which are cited in this report. In addition, the United States has become a net exporter of petroleum products (while it remains a net importer of crude oil). With declining U.S. import dependence, reliance on petroleum and petroleum products may be less of a factor in promoting alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles in the future. In addition to concerns over petroleum import dependence, other factors also have driven policy on alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies. Federal incentives do not reflect a single, comprehensive strategy but rather an aggregative approach to a range of discrete public policy issues, including improving environmental quality, expanding domestic manufacturing, and promoting agriculture and rural development. While a reliance on foreign sources of petroleum was an overriding concern for much of the past 40 years, other factors, such as rural development, promotion of domestic manufacturing, and environmental concerns, have also shaped congressional interest in alternative fuels and technologies. A variety of programs affecting the development and commercialization of alternative fuels and technologies have been proposed and enacted, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. (This report does not evaluate the effectiveness of alternative fuel programs and incentives.) Alternative fuels programs can be generally classified into six categories: expanding domestic ethanol production; establishing other alternative fuels; encouraging the purchase of nonpetroleum vehicles; reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; supporting U.S. vehicle manufacturing; and funding U.S. highways. Ethanol has been seen as a homegrown alternative to imported oil. A number of programs were put in place to encourage its domestic development (instead of importing from other ethanol producers, such as Brazil). To spur establishment of this domestic industry, Congress has enacted a number of laws, which are beneficial to states that have a large concentration of corn growers (corn being the raw material feedstock in most U.S. ethanol). Many of the incentives for ethanol production have been included in farm-related legislation and appropriations acts and hence have been administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), or in tax provisions administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC) provided a tax credit to gasoline suppliers who blended ethanol with gasoline. The small ethanol producer tax credit provided a limited additional credit for small ethanol producers. Both credits expired at the end of 2011. Since 2005, petroleum refiners and importers have been required to supply biofuels as a share of their gasoline and diesel supply. This mandate, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), has been an impetus for expanded production and use of ethanol and other biofuels. In addition to ethanol, Congress has sought to spur development of other alternative fuels, such as biodiesel, cellulosic biofuel, hydrogen, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Some of these fuels have been supported through tax credits (such as the biodiesel tax credit), federal mandates (mainly the RFS), and R&D programs (such as the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, which provides grants for new technologies leading to the commercialization of biofuels). Congress has enacted laws which seek to boost consumer adoption by providing tax credits for the purchase of some vehicles that consume far less petroleum than conventional vehicles, or that do not consume petroleum at all. These tax credit programs generally are limited in duration as a way to encourage early adopters to take a risk on new kinds of vehicles. The proponents contend that once a significant number of such new cars and trucks are on the road, additional buyers would be attracted to them, the increased volume would result in lower prices, and the tax credits would no longer be needed. Currently, a credit is available for the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles. Expired credits include incentives for hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, advanced lean burn technology vehicles, and certain alternative fuel vehicles. Congress has also enacted tax credits to spur the expansion of infrastructure to fuel such vehicles, although these credits have likewise expired. Several agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT), have been mandated by statute to address concerns over fuel consumption and vehicle emissions through programs for alternative fuels. The most significant and long-standing program to reduce vehicle fuel consumption is the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program administered by DOT. Under CAFE, each manufacturer's fleet must meet specific miles-per-gallon standards for passenger vehicles and light trucks. If a manufacturer fails to do so, it is subject to financial penalties. Manufacturers can accrue credits toward meeting CAFE standards for the production and sale of certain types of alternative fuel vehicles. A joint rulemaking process between DOT and EPA links future CAFE standards with greenhouse gas (GHG) standards promulgated under EPA's Clean Air Act authority. DOT also established the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) to fund programs that intended to reduce emissions in urban areas that exceed certain air quality standards. At EPA, the Diesel Emission Reduction Act (DERA) was implemented with a goal of reducing diesel emissions by funding and implementing new technologies. In addition, EPA's RFS mandates the use of renewable fuels for transportation. Under the RFS, some classes of biofuels must achieve GHG emission reductions relative to gasoline. The Department of Energy (DOE), in partnership with U.S. automakers, federal labs, and academic institutions, has funded and overseen research and development programs on vehicle electrification for decades, in particular research focused on how to produce economical batteries that extend electric vehicle range. These R&D programs were supplemented in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) to include grants to U.S.-based companies for facilities to manufacture advanced battery systems, component manufacturers, and software designers to boost domestic production and international competitiveness. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program at DOE, established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ), has supported manufacturing plant investments to enable the development of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption, including the manufacture of electric and hybrid vehicles, although no new loans have been approved since 2011. As described below (see \" Motor Fuel Excise Taxes \"), one of the earliest fuels-related federal programs is the motor vehicle fuels excise tax first passed in the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 to fund construction and maintenance of the interstate highway system. Originally, only gasoline and diesel were taxed, but as newer fuels became available (such as ethanol and compressed natural gas), they were added to the federal revenue program, but often at lower tax rates than gasoline or diesel. Lower tax burdens for some fuels or vehicles may effectively incentivize those choices over conventional options. However, lower tax burdens for these vehicles and fuels could compromise federal highway revenue. The vehicles responsible for lower tax revenues include traditional internal combustion engine vehicles with higher mileage per gallon as well as new technology electric and hybrid cars. The federal tax incentives and programs discussed in this report aim to support the development and deployment of alternative fuels. There is no central coordination of how these incentives interact. In general, they are independently administered by separate federal agencies, including five agencies: Department of the Treasury, DOE, DOT, EPA, and USDA. This report focuses strictly on programs that directly support alternative fuels or advanced vehicles. It does not address more general programs (e.g., general manufacturing loans, rural development loans), or programs that have been authorized but never funded. The programs are presented by agency, starting with those that generally address the above factors, followed by those that are fuel- or technology-specific. Programs that expired or were repealed on or after December 31, 2017, are included in Appendix A , Recently Expired or Repealed Programs. Congress may explore whether to reinstate these expired programs or establish similar programs.

{"input": "", "context": "T he Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides cash benefits to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers; firefighters; employees of emergency management agencies; and members of emergency medical services agencies who are killed or permanently and totally disabled as the result of personal injuries sustained in the line of duty. The Public Safety Officers' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program, a component of the PSOB program, provides higher-education assistance to the children and spouses of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. Both programs are administered by the PSOB Office of the Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). Congress appropriates funds for these programs in the annual Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. For FY2019, the one-time lump-sum PSOB benefit is $359,316 and the monthly full-time attendance PSOEA assistance is $1,224. The PSOB and PSOEA benefit amounts are indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living. Table 1 shows PSOB and PSOEA claims and approvals as reported by DOJ. To be eligible for PSOB benefits for death or disability, a person must have served in one of the following categories of public safety officers: law enforcement officer, firefighter, or chaplain in a public agency; FEMA employee or a state, local, or tribal emergency management agency employee; or emergency medical services member. There is no minimum amount of time a person must have served to be eligible for benefits. To be eligible for PSOB benefits as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or chaplain, a person must have served in a \"public agency\" in an official capacity, with or without compensation. For the purposes of PSOB eligibility, a public agency is defined as the federal government and any department, agency, or instrumentality of the federal government; and any state government, the District of Columbia government, and any U.S. territory or possession; and any local government, department, agency, or instrumentality of a state, the District of Columbia, or any U.S. territory or possession. For the purposes of PSOB eligibility, a law enforcement officer is defined as \"an individual involved in crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction, or enforcement of the criminal laws (including juvenile delinquency), including, but not limited to, police, corrections, probation, parole, and judicial officers.\" For the purposes of PSOB eligibility, the definition of firefighter includes both professional firefighters and persons serving as an \"officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized volunteer fire department.\" A chaplain is eligible for PSOB benefits (1) if he or she is either an \"officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized volunteer fire department or legally organized police department\" or public employee of a police or fire department and (2) only if he or she was performing the duties of a chaplain in an official capacity while responding to a police, fire, or rescue emergency. Employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state, local, or tribal emergency management agencies may be eligible for PSOB benefits under certain conditions provided in statute. A FEMA employee or an employee of a state, local, or tribal emergency management agency working with FEMA is eligible for PSOB benefits if he or she is performing official duties that are related to a major disaster or an emergency declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) and that are considered hazardous by the FEMA Administrator or the head of the state, local, or tribal agency. A member, including a volunteer member, of a rescue squad or \"ambulance crew\" who is authorized or licensed by law and the applicable agency and is engaging in rescue services or providing emergency medical services may be eligible for PSOB benefits. The rescue squad or ambulance service may provide ground or air ambulance services and may be either a public agency or a nonprofit entity authorized to provide rescue or emergency medical services. By PSOB regulation, eligible emergency medical services workers include rescue workers, ambulance drivers, paramedics, health care responders, emergency medical technicians, or others who are trained in rescue activity or emergency medical services and have the legal authority and responsibility to provide such services. The PSOB program pays benefits if a public safety officer becomes permanently and totally disabled or dies \"as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\" To qualify for coverage under the PSOB program, a public safety officer's disability or death must have been the result of a personal injury. The PSOB regulation defines an injury for the purposes of benefit eligibility as a traumatic physical wound (or a traumatized physical condition of the body) directly and proximately caused by external force (such as bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects, or physical blows), chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious disease, radiation, virii, or bacteria ... The regulation also provides that the definition of an injury does not include an occupational disease or a condition of the body caused by stress or strain, including psychological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the PSOB statute specifically provides for deaths caused by certain cardiovascular conditions. The death of a public safety officer due to a heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture shall be presumed to be a death from a personal injury for the purposes of PSOB eligibility if the officer engaged in nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity as part of an emergency response or training exercise; and if the condition began during the physical activity, while the officer remained on duty after the physical activity, or within 24 hours of the physical activity. The PSOB program covers a public safety officer's death or disability if it occurred as the result of an injury incurred in the line of duty. The PSOB regulations provide that an injury occurs in the line of duty if it (1) is the result of the public safety officer's authorized activities while on duty, (2) occurs while responding to an emergency or request for assistance, or (3) occurs while commuting to or from duty in an authorized department or personal vehicle. In addition, if there is convincing evidence that the injury was the result of the individual's status as a public safety officer, that injury is covered by the PSOB program. The lump-sum PSOB death and disability benefit for FY2019 is $359,316. The benefit amount is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of living using the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the one-year period ending in the previous June. If a public safety officer receives a disability benefit and later dies from the same injury, the officer's survivors may not receive a PSOB death benefit. The payable benefit amount is based on the date of the public safety officer's death or the date of the injury that caused the disability, rather than on the date of application for benefits or disability determination. Thus, if a benefit increase occurs while an application is pending, the benefit is payable at the previous, lower, benefit level. Death and disability benefits are not subject to the federal income tax. In general, PSOB death and disability benefits are paid in addition to any other workers' compensation, life insurance, or other benefits paid for the death of a public safety officer. However, the PSOB death benefit is offset by the following benefits: benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) payable to state and local law enforcement officers injured or killed while enforcing federal law; benefits under the D.C. Retirement and Disability Act of 1916 for certain police officers and firefighters in the District of Columbia; and payments from the September 11 th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF). PSOB death benefits are payable to the eligible spouse and children of a public safety officer. A spouse is the person to whom the officer is legally married, even if physically separated, under the marriage laws of the jurisdiction where the marriage took place. Pursuant to regulations issued after the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act in United States v. Windsor , the legally married spouse of a public safety office may be of the same sex as the officer. A child is defined as any \"natural, illegitimate, adopted, or posthumous child or stepchild\" of the public safety officer who, at the time of the public safety officer's fatal or catastrophic injury, is 18 years of age or under; between 18 and 23 years of age and a full-time student in high school or undergraduate higher education; or over 18 years of age and incapable of self-support because of physical or mental disability. PSOB death benefits are paid to eligible survivors in the following order: 1. if the officer is survived by only a spouse, 100% of the death benefits are payable to the spouse; 2. if the officer is survived by a spouse and children, 50% of the death benefits are payable to the spouse and the remaining 50% is distributed equally among the officer's children; 3. if the officer is survived by only children, the death benefits are equally distributed among the officer's children; 4. if the officer has no surviving spouse or children, the death benefits are paid to the individual or individuals designated by the officer in the most recently executed designation of beneficiary on file at the time of the officer's death; or if the officer does not have a designation of beneficiary on file, the benefits are paid to the individual or individuals designated by the officer in the most recently executed life insurance policy on file at the time of the officer's death; 5. if the officer has no surviving spouse or eligible children, and the officer does not have a life insurance policy, the death benefits are equally distributed between the officer's surviving parents; or 6. if the officer has no surviving spouse, eligible children, or parents, and the officer did not have a designation of beneficiary or a life insurance policy on file at the time of his or her death, the death benefits are payable to surviving adult, nondependent, children of the officer. PSOB disability benefits are paid only in cases of permanent and total disability. There are no benefits payable for partial or short-term disabilities. A disability is considered permanent for the purposes of PSOB eligibility if, given the current state of medicine in the United States, there is a degree of medical certainty that the condition will remain constant or deteriorate over the person's lifetime or that the public safety officer has reached maximum medical improvement. A public safety officer is considered to be totally disabled for the purposes of PSOB eligibility if given the current state of medicine in the United States, there is a degree of medical certainty that the officer is unable to perform any gainful work. PSOB regulation defines gainful work as \"full- or part-time activity that is compensated or commonly compensated.\" Applications for PSOB death and disability benefits are filed with the PSOB office, which determines benefit eligibility and commences benefit payment. Unless extended for good cause, application deadlines must be met. Complete benefit applications must be filed no later than for death benefits: three years after the death; one year after the determination of the officer's employing agency to award or deny death benefits payable by that agency; or one year after certification by the officer's employing agency that the agency is not authorized to pay any death benefits; and for disability benefits: three years after the date of the injury; one year after the determination of the officer's employing agency to award or deny workers' compensation or disability benefits payable by that agency; or one year after certification by the officer's employing agency that the agency is not authorized to pay any workers' compensation or disability benefits. A lump-sum interim payment of up to $3,000 may be made if a PSOB death benefit will \"probably be paid.\" The interim payment amount reduces the final PSOB payment amount. If the ultimate decision is to deny death benefits, the interim payment must be returned to the federal government, unless this repayment is waived because it would create a hardship for the beneficiary. Section 611 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act; P.L. 107-56 ) provides for expedited payment of PSOB death and disability benefits if the officer's injury occurred \"in connection with prevention, investigation, rescue, or recovery efforts related to a terrorist attack.\" In such cases, PSOB benefits must be paid within 30 days of certification from the officer's employing agency that the officer's death or disability was related to terrorism. The Public Safety Officers' Education Assistance (PSOEA) program provides financial assistance with costs associated with higher education to the spouse or children of a public safety officer who is eligible for PSOB death or disability benefits. The spouse or child of a public safety officer who is eligible for PSOB death or disability benefits may be eligible for PSOEA benefits. To be eligible for PSOEA benefits, a spouse must have been married to an eligible public safety officer at the time of the officer's death or injury. A child is eligible for PSOEA benefits until the age of 27. This age limit can be extended by the Attorney General in extraordinary circumstances, or, pursuant to Section 3 of the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-36 ), if there is a delay of more than one year in approving PSOB or PSOEA benefits. In addition, to be eligible for PSOEA benefits, the spouse or child must be enrolled at an eligible educational institution. For the purposes of PSOEA eligibility, an eligible education institution is one that meets the definition of an \"institution of higher education\" as provided by Section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and that is eligible for federal student aid. PSOEA benefits are payable to the claimant and may be used only to defray costs associated with higher education attendance, including tuition, room, board, book and supplies, and education-related fees. The monthly PSOEA benefit amount is equal to the monthly benefit amount payable under the GI Bill Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program, which is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for spouses and dependents of veterans with disabilities or who died as a result of service-connected conditions. The PSOEA benefit amounts are adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of living in accordance with changes to the GI Bill DEA benefit amounts. For FY2019, the PSOEA monthly benefit for a student attending an educational institution full-time is $1,224. The PSOEA benefit rates are prorated for less than full-time attendance. The maximum duration of PSOEA benefits for any person is 45 months of full-time education or a proportionate duration of part-time education. A person is ineligible for PSOEA if he or she is in default on a federal student loan or is ineligible for federal benefits due to a drug trafficking or drug possession conviction. In addition, the Attorney General may discontinue PSOEA benefits for a student that fails to make satisfactory progress in his or her course of study as defined by Section 484(c) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. A claimant who is dissatisfied with a PSOB disability benefit denial may request a reconsideration. There is no reconsideration offered for denials of PSOB death or PSOEA benefits. A claimant who is dissatisfied with a PSOB or PSOEA benefit denial may request a de novo hearing before a hearing officer assigned by the director of the DOJ PSOB Office. The determination of a hearing officer may be appealed to the PSOB Office director. The director's determination is considered the final agency determination and is not subject to any further agency administrative review or appeal. However, provided all administrative appeals remedies have been exhausted, the PSOB Office director's determination may be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The PSOB statute authorizes the BJA to prescribe the maximum fee that an attorney or other representative may charge a claimant for services rendered in connection with a claim, with attorney fees generally limited to between 3% and 6% of the total benefit paid, depending on the level in the administrative appeals process the claim is approved. Program regulation prohibits stipulated-fee and contingency-fee arrangements for PSOB representation. Congress provides funding for PSOB and PSOE benefits and associated administrative expenses in the annual Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. Funding for PSOB death benefits and associated administrative expenses is considered mandatory spending and Congress appropriates \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the payment of these benefits. Funding for PSOB disability and PSOEA benefits is considered discretionary and is subject to specific congressional appropriations. Annual appropriations language grants the Attorney General the authority to transfer from any available appropriations to the DOJ the funds necessary to respond to emergent circumstances that require additional funding for PSOB disability benefits and PSOEA benefits.

{"input": "", "context": "The Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) administers SEC’s nationwide examination and inspection program for registered SROs, broker-dealers, transfer agents, clearing agencies, investment companies, and investment advisers. OCIE conducts examinations and inspections to improve compliance, prevent fraud, monitor risk, and inform policy. Individual groups in OCIE have oversight responsibility for the various registered entities. The FINRA and Securities Industry Oversight (FSIO) program within OCIE performs examinations of FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, an SRO that regulates the municipal bond market. As part of its FINRA oversight activities, FSIO conducts four types of reviews that may involve Section 964 areas. Program inspections are reviews of FINRA operations and program areas (for example, FINRA’s review of applications by broker-dealers seeking to become members). Oversight examinations are single, stand-alone examinations of specific examinations that FINRA conducts of its member firms. FSIO initiates an oversight examination when its examinations of a broker- dealer find deficiencies FSIO believes should have been identified by FINRA in its own examination of the broker-dealer. Thematic oversight examinations are a series of oversight examinations that evaluate FINRA’s review of a particular regulatory area across a number of its member firms. Tips, complaints, and referrals are allegations or statements of concern about possible violations of securities laws or risky conduct received by SEC. FSIO reviews FINRA-related tips, complaints, and referrals by evaluating facts and circumstances and conducting background research. The reviews may result in FINRA-related inspections or examinations or may be used for inspection planning purposes. To help identify the FINRA programs and topics that it will review, FSIO uses a risk-based approach that includes an annual assessment of high- risk areas and consideration of the areas specified in Section 964. According to SEC staff, FSIO also conducts ongoing monitoring of FINRA’s activities through reviews of information provided by FINRA and meetings with FINRA officials. Generally accepted government auditing standards define performance audits as those that provide findings or conclusions based on an evaluation of sufficient, appropriate evidence against criteria. Performance audit objectives can include assessments of program effectiveness, economy, and efficiency; internal control; compliance; and prospective analyses. SEC’s examinations of SROs share many of the attributes of performance audits, including their objectives. For example, examinations (including inspections) of FINRA enable FSIO staff to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations; FINRA rules, regulations, or by-laws; or both. Although SEC is not required to follow the auditing standards when examining SROs, these standards and guidance provide a framework for conducting high-quality reviews that can serve as useful criteria in evaluating a regulatory agency’s examination or inspection programs. Areas of generally accepted government auditing standards relevant to SRO examinations include independence, competence, quality control and assurance, planning, supervision, evidence, documentation, and reporting: Independence refers to the audit organization and individual auditor’s need to be independent and include documentation proving independence. Competence refers to the extent to which audit staff collectively should possess adequate professional competence and technical knowledge, skills, and expertise. Quality control and assurance refers to a system of quality control that an organization should establish that is designed to provide the organization with reasonable assurance that its personnel comply with professional standards and legal requirements. Planning includes creating a written audit plan for each audit. Supervision requirements include sufficient guidance and direction to the staff assigned to the audit to address the audit objectives and follow applicable requirements, while staying informed about significant problems encountered, reviewing the work performed, and providing effective on-the-job training. Evidence refers to sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for the auditor’s findings and conclusions. Audit documentation requirements state that auditors must prepare documentation related to planning, conducting, and reporting for each audit. Finally, communication of the results entails auditors issuing audit reports. Since fiscal year 2015, SEC examinations related to FINRA included reviews of all areas identified in Section 964. We determined that FSIO completed at least one examination covering each of the Section 964 areas since fiscal year 2015 (see table 1). In total, FSIO began or completed 61 examinations (program inspections, oversight examinations, and thematic oversight examinations) related to FINRA programs and operations in that period. Some examinations evaluated other aspects of FINRA’s programs and operations (those not specifically identified in Section 964), such as market surveillance and restitution for harmed investors. FSIO examinations either focused on a single Section 964 area or considered multiple areas. Some examinations focused specifically on a single Section 964 area. For example, in 2017 FSIO reviewed FINRA’s arbitration program, which provides retail investors a venue for resolving disputes with their brokers. Other examinations considered one or more of the areas as part of a broader scope. For instance, a program inspection completed in 2016 touched on FINRA’s arbitration services, cooperation with state securities regulators, transparency, and other topics. Another program inspection involved governance, policies on former employees, and other topics. FSIO examinations most frequently covered FINRA examinations (41 of 61). Nearly all of the oversight examinations reviewed at least some aspect of FINRA examinations. In two cases, the oversight examinations also covered another area—review of advertising by FINRA members. We found that OCIE policies and procedures used for examining FINRA since fiscal year 2015 generally were consistent with the requirements of generally accepted government auditing standards. SEC uses an examination manual to conduct its SRO examinations. We previously found that OCIE policies and procedures (including the prior version of the manual) generally were consistent with the requirements of the auditing standards that we determined were most relevant to assessing examination policies and procedures: independence, competence, quality control and assurance, planning, supervision, evidence, documentation, and reporting. We compared the current and prior versions of the examination manual. More specifically, we selected requirements for planning, prefieldwork scoping, and communicating findings from the current manual and compared those with similar sections in the prior version of the manual. We found that the new version includes the same material as the prior version while also incorporating additional guidance in certain areas. The planning section of the current version includes two additional requirements on the inclusion of non-National Examination Program staff. The communicating findings section of the current version included two additional requirements related to extensions of time to respond to disposition letters. Two of the four additional requirements were generally consistent with government auditing standards, and the remaining two additional requirements were minor adjustments that did not materially change the requirements. Therefore, we deemed the selected sections of the current version of the manual to also be consistent with the auditing standards. OCIE (and from 2016, FSIO) program inspections of FINRA governance in fiscal years 2015–2017 were consistent with internal examination guidance. OCIE identified five inspections in that period that related to FINRA governance. Each of the inspections focused on one of the following areas: (1) code of conduct, (2) executive and employee compensation practices, (3) investment portfolio, (4) compliance resource provider program, and (5) the funding mechanism for its regulatory services agreement. FINRA’s code of conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to its role as a securities regulator. The code also outlines FINRA’s ethical commitments and expectations and provides guidance on what employees must do to meet them. FINRA’s executive and employee compensation practices consist of salary and incentive compensation determined by FINRA’s Management Compensation Committee using operational, strategic, and financial factors, in addition to individual performance. FINRA’s investment portfolio is governed by a policy based on the degree of risk appropriate for FINRA assets, as applied by its board to its investment objectives. In the compliance resource provider program, FINRA worked with organizations to offer firms compliance-related products and services at a discounted price or with additional features. According to FINRA staff, this program was discontinued in May 2017 and replaced with FINRA’s Compliance Vendor Directory. FINRA’s regulatory service agreements are designed to provide market surveillance, financial surveillance, examinations, investigations, and disciplinary services to other entities, including the New York Stock Exchange LLC and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. For our review, we judgmentally selected the most relevant requirements from the section of the examination manual related to planning inspections and the most relevant requirements from the section of the manual related to communicating inspection findings to determine if OCIE conducted the inspections in accordance with its guidance. The planning section covers planning examinations and prefieldwork scoping and requires the examination team to discuss the results of background research and determine an appropriate scope for the examination as early as possible. The communicating findings section requires entities to be provided with timely and concise communications on the results. It also discusses how examination staff should take further actions for those findings that could involve notifications to other regulators. We reviewed relevant inspection-related documentation (including scope memorandums, disposition letters, emails, and information extracted from an examination database) and compared them against the selected requirements to determine if the guidance was followed. We tallied our results with a scorecard methodology (see fig. 1). We found that all five inspections we reviewed met all requirements applicable to that particular inspection. For example, across all the inspections, OCIE examiners held prefieldwork meetings and documented and received approval for the scope of the examinations. Additionally, all five inspections met the required 180-day completion deadline and closed the inspection with a disposition letter. In cases in which requirements were not applicable, the reasons generally were that a triggering event had not occurred and no further action was needed. For instance, the scope was not modified in any of the inspections, so the requirement for approval of such modifications did not apply. Furthermore, none of the inspections included non-National Examination Program staff (such as personnel from SEC’s Enforcement Division), and so requirements surrounding participation by those groups did not apply. We provided a draft of this report to SEC for their review and comment. In its comment letter, which is reprinted in appendix II, SEC concurred with our findings and appreciated our attention to the issues discussed in the report. SEC also provided technical comments on the draft report, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., and other interested parties. In addition, this report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8678 or clementsm@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This report (1) determines if the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) oversight of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.’s (FINRA) operations and programs since fiscal year 2015 included the 10 areas specified in Section 964 of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), (2) evaluates the extent to which selected SEC internal guidance on conducting examinations of FINRA follows generally accepted government auditing standards, and (3) evaluates the extent to which examinations of FINRA’s governance practices followed SEC’s internal guidance. To assess whether oversight of FINRA by SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) included the Section 964 areas, we requested and reviewed documentation for all examinations since fiscal year 2015 (from October 2014 through April 2018) that OCIE staff identified as relating to Section 964 areas. We use the term “examination” to include program inspections, two types of oversight examinations, and oversight activities stemming from tips and referrals. The documentation included scope memorandums, deficiency letters, and closing letters to the file for OCIE examinations. We evaluated whether the documentation indicated that an examination’s scope and findings covered one or more Section 964 areas or included other areas related to FINRA oversight that were not specified in Section 964. To determine the extent to which OCIE’s internal guidance on conducting examinations of FINRA followed generally accepted government auditing standards, we compared SEC’s examination manual against generally accepted auditing standards. We reviewed selected sections of the current version of the manual and the earlier version. We judgmentally selected the two sections that most directly related to our focus on self- regulatory organization (SRO) inspections, which focused on preparing for examinations and communicating examination findings. Other areas of the examination manual that were not relevant focused on administration and organizational issues. We relied on our work that found that the earlier version of the manual followed the auditing standards and also interviewed pertinent staff within OCIE to discuss the guidance and why it did or did not include certain elements. We analyzed any differences between the versions to determine whether changes or additions in the current version of the manual also followed auditing standards. In addition, we interviewed FINRA staff to gain a general understanding of how OCIE staff work with them to conduct examinations. To determine the extent to which OCIE’s program inspections of FINRA’s governance in fiscal years 2015–2017 followed OCIE’s internal guidance, we used a scorecard methodology to compare inspections of FINRA’s governance with the examination manual and draft updates. We only reviewed the extent to which examinations followed specified guidelines and did not evaluate the analysis, findings, or disposition of the examinations. We created a checklist of relevant elements from the examination manual by judgmentally selecting 6 requirements from the planning inspections section of the manual and 11 requirements from the communicating findings section of the manual that were most applicable to our focus on the actual SRO inspection process. Other requirements that we deemed less relevant include examinations of exempt reporting advisers and the process for approving examination documents. The planning section of the manual covers planning examinations and prefieldwork scoping and requires the examination team to discuss the results of background research and determine an appropriate scope for the examination as early as possible. The communication of examination findings section requires entities to be provided with timely and concise communications on the results. It also discusses how examination staff should take further actions for those findings that could involve notifications to other regulators. We then reviewed different types of inspection-related documentation to determine whether the guidance was followed. For instance, we assessed certain inspection requirements, such as compliance with changing the scope of the inspection, based on formal written documentation such as scope memorandums and disposition letters. We assessed other requirements (such as whether prefieldwork team meetings were held) based on informal documentation, such as email appointments. We also relied on other internal documentation, which included the examination tracking database, which is used to certify compliance with a requirement to complete an inspection within 180 days from the completion of audit work. Two analysts then independently compared the elements against documentation for the five OCIE inspections to determine the extent to which the inspections documented the requirements outlined in the examination manual. Analysts assigned a rating of “yes” if the element was found in the inspection materials we reviewed, “no” if there was no mention of the element in the inspection materials we reviewed, “partially” if the element was not fully addressed in the inspection materials we reviewed, and “n/a” if the element was not applicable to the inspection. We also interviewed pertinent staff within OCIE to discuss the guidance and why it did or did not include certain elements. We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to July 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

FINRA, a self-regulatory organization, is responsible for regulating securities firms doing business with the public in the United States. SEC oversees FINRA's operations and programs.

{"input": "", "context": "In our September 2018 report, we found that from 2010 through 2016 the number of Native American youth in federal and state and local justice systems declined across all phases of the justice process—arrest, adjudication, and confinement—according to our analysis of available data. At the federal level, arrests by federal agencies dropped from 60 Native American youth in 2010 to 20 in 2016, and at the state and local level, arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent from 18,295 arrested in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016. Our analysis also found that the vast majority of these Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems, not the federal system. For example, from 2010 through 2016, there were 105,487 total arrests of Native American youth reported by state and local law enforcement agencies (LEAs). In contrast, there were 246 Native American youth held in federal custody by the U.S. Marshals Service due to arrest by federal LEAs during the same period. We also found a number of similarities between Native American and non-Native American youth in state and local justice systems. For example, the offenses that Native American youth and non-Native American youth were arrested, adjudicated, and confined for were generally similar. In contrast, our analysis also showed a number of differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, our analysis showed variation in the types of offenses committed by each group. From fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the majority of Native American youth in the federal justice system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses being assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of involvement of non-Native American youth in the federal system during the same period was due to public order or drug and alcohol offenses at all three stages, with the top two specific offenses being drug and immigration related. Our September 2018 report contains additional information on the differences between Native American and non-Native American youth involved with the federal justice system. Further, we found that the percent of Native American youth involved in most state and local systems was generally similar to their representation in the youth populations in those states. For example, our analysis found that the majority (about 75 percent) of Native American youth arrested by state and local LEAs from calendar years 2010 through 2016 were located in 10 states: Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin. These 10 states had among the highest percent of Native Americans in their states’ overall youth populations, according to 2016 U.S. Census estimates we reviewed. In 2016, the largest number of arrests by state and local LEAs occurred in Arizona and South Dakota. In contrast, we found that representation of Native American youth arrested, referred for adjudication, and confined at the federal level during the period reviewed was greater (13 to 19 percent) than their representation in the nationwide youth population (1.6 percent). DOJ officials told us that the population of Native Americans in the federal justice system has historically been higher than their share in the nationwide population, and they attributed this and other differences shown by our analysis to federal government jurisdiction over certain crimes in Indian country, as well as the absence of general federal government jurisdiction over non-Native American youth. According to DOJ officials, this jurisdiction requires the federal government to prosecute offenses that would commonly be prosecuted by states if committed outside of Indian country. According to DOJ officials, a small handful of federal criminal statutes apply to all juveniles, such as immigration and drug statutes, but the federal government has been granted greater jurisdiction over Native American youth than non-Native American youth by federal laws that apply to crimes committed in Indian Country, such as the Major Crimes Act. For example, one DOJ official noted that the Major Crimes Act gives the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over crimes such as burglary and sex offenses committed in Indian country. This differs from the treatment of non-Native American youth, who are not prosecuted in the federal system for the same types of offenses, because the federal government does not have jurisdiction over those youth for such offenses. Non-Native American youth are instead subject to the general juvenile delinquency jurisdiction of state and local courts. Additionally, DOJ officials stated that tribal justice systems are often underfunded and do not have the capacity to handle Native American youths’ cases. Therefore, they stated that when both federal and tribal justice systems have jurisdiction, the federal system might be the only system in which the youth’s case may be adjudicated. For these reasons, the percentage of Native American youth offenders in the federal justice system is higher than non-Native American juveniles in accordance with population size, according to DOJ officials. Representatives from four of the five Native American organizations we interviewed, whose mission and scope of work focus on Native American juvenile justice issues and that have a national or geographically specific perspective, noted that federal jurisdiction is a key contributor to the higher percentage of Native American youth involved at the federal justice level. Additionally, representatives from all five organizations noted, similarly to DOJ officials, that federal jurisdiction over crimes in Indian country is typically for more serious offenses (specifically under the Major Crimes Act), such as offenses against a person. Comprehensive data from tribal justice systems on the involvement of Native American youth were not available. However, we identified and reviewed a few data sources that provided insights about the arrest, adjudication, and confinement of Native American youth by tribal justice systems. See appendix II for a summary of our analysis of data from these sources. In our September 2018 report, we identified 122 discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant programs) offered by DOJ and HHS from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that could help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS made approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards through the 122 programs over the period, of which the agencies awarded about $207.7 million to tribal governments or Native American organizations. A list of the 122 programs, which focus on a range of issues such as violence or trauma, justice system reform, alcohol and substance abuse, and reentry and recidivism, can be found in our September 2018 report. The 122 DOJ and HHS grant programs we identified included 27 programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary and 95 programs that did not specify these populations but could include them as beneficiaries. For example, the Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention offered the Defending Childhood American Indian/Alaska Native Policy Initiative: Supporting Trauma-Informed Juvenile Justice Systems for Tribes program for funding in fiscal year 2016. The goal of this program— increasing the capacity of federally recognized tribes’ juvenile justice and related systems to improve the life outcomes of youth who are at risk or who are involved in the justice system and to reduce youth exposure to violence—explicitly focused on tribal communities. On the other hand, the Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act grant program, which HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration offered for funding in fiscal year 2016 to prevent and reduce alcohol use among youth and young adults, is an example of a program that did not specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary but could include them as beneficiaries. We found that tribal governments and Native American organizations were eligible for almost all of the grant programs we identified. Specifically, they were eligible to apply for 70 of 73 DOJ programs and 48 of 49 HHS programs. However, although tribal governments and Native American organizations were eligible to apply for almost all of the programs, we found in a non-generalizable sample of applications we reviewed that they applied primarily for the programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. For example, we reviewed applications for 18 DOJ grant programs and found that tribal governments and Native American organizations accounted for over 99 percent of the applications for the 5 grant programs within the sample that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. However, tribal governments and Native American organizations accounted for about 1 percent of the applications for the 13 programs in the sample that did not specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. We interviewed officials from DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and seven HHS operating divisions to obtain their perspectives on why tribal governments and Native American organizations might not apply for grant programs that do not specify them as a primary beneficiary. They identified various reasons, including that tribal governments and Native American organizations might not be aware that they are eligible to apply for certain grant programs; might believe that their applications to grant programs that do not specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary will not be competitive with other applications; or might prefer to apply for those grant programs that specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. We also interviewed representatives from 10 tribal governments and Native American organizations, who provided perspectives on whether or not a grant program’s focus on tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary affected their decision to apply for the program. Officials from 6 of 10 tribal governments and Native American organizations indicated that they would consider any grant program that met the needs of their communities, while the remaining 4 indicated that a grant program’s focus or lack thereof on tribes or Native Americans could affect their ability to apply for it. Officials from the 10 tribal governments and Native American organizations also identified various federal practices they found helpful or challenging when applying for grant programs related to preventing or addressing delinquency among Native American youth. When asked what federal practices, if any, were particularly helpful when applying to receive federal funding, they most frequently responded that they found it particularly helpful to be able to call or meet with federal officials if they had questions about or needed help on their applications. Regarding the biggest challenges, they cited short application deadlines, difficulties collecting data for grant program applications, and a scarcity of grant writers and other personnel needed to complete a quality application. In addition, DOJ OJP and HHS officials provided perspectives on why some tribal governments and Native American organizations might be more successful in applying for federal funding than others. The officials stated, among other things, that larger and better-resourced tribal governments and Native American organizations were more successful at applying for federal funding and that previously successful grant program applicants were more likely to be successful again. More detailed information on the perspectives from tribal governments, Native American organizations, and agency officials regarding the factors they believe affect the ability of tribal governments and Native American organizations to apply successfully for federal grant programs can be found in our September 2018 report. Chairman Hoeven, Vice Chairman Udall, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have at this time. For our September 2018 report, we obtained and analyzed record-level and summary data from federal, state and local, and tribal justice systems from 2010 through 2016. Figure 1 illustrates the data sources we included in our report for each phase of the justice process (arrest, adjudication, and confinement) in each justice system (federal, state and local, and tribal). Generally, state and local entities include those managed by states, counties, or municipalities. Comprehensive data from tribal justice systems on the involvement of American Indian and Alaska Native (Native American) youth were not available. However, in our September 2018 report, we identified and reviewed a few data sources that can provide certain insights about the arrest, adjudication, and confinement of Native American youth by tribal justice systems. The following is a summary of our analysis of data from these sources. Arrests. Although comprehensive data on the number of tribal law enforcement agency (LEA) arrests were not available, we obtained and reviewed admission records from three juvenile detention centers in Indian country managed by the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Based on those records, at least 388 Native American tribal youth were admitted to these three facilities in 2016, as shown in table 1. In the Northern Cheyenne facility, for which we obtained records for 5 years, the number of youth admitted increased yearly between 2012 and 2016, from 14 to 204. According to BIA officials, this growth in the number of youth admitted to the Northern Cheyenne facility likely reflects an increase in admissions of Native American youth from surrounding tribes. Specifically, because the Northern Cheyenne facility is centrally located, the officials said that the facility admits youth from other tribes, which have grown accustomed to sending their youth to the facility. BIA officials also noted that the Northern Cheyenne facility services an area where there is a high rate of delinquency among youth, and because the facility works well with Native American youth struggling with delinquency issues, many tribes elect to send their delinquent youth to the facility. Further, since 2012, the Northern Cheyenne facility increased its bed space and staff, thus increasing its capacity to admit more youth, according to BIA officials. Even though comprehensive tribal arrest data were not available, we reported in September 2018 that the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) was undertaking an effort to increase collection of arrest data from tribal LEAs. Specifically, this data collection activity is the Census of Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies. This collection activity, which BJS plans to conduct in 2019, is to capture information including tribal LEA workloads and arrests, tribal LEA access to and participation in regional and national justice database systems, and tribal LEA reporting of crime data into FBI databases. Adjudication. Comprehensive data were not available to describe the extent to which tribal courts processed Native American youth or found them guilty. However, BJS concluded a tribal court data collection effort— the National Survey of Tribal Court Systems—in 2015. Through this survey, BJS gathered information from more than 300 tribal courts and other tribal judicial entities on their criminal, civil, domestic violence, and youth caseloads, and pretrial and probation programs, among other things. DOJ officials told us that BJS has analyzed the data, and plans to release results in the future. Confinement. According to data published by BJS, the number of youth in Indian country jails declined from 190 in 2014 to 170 in 2016 (about an 11 percent decrease).

GAO's analysis of available data found that the number of American Indian and Alaska Native (Native American) youth in federal and state and local justice systems declined across all phases of the justice process—arrest, adjudication, and confinement—from 2010 through 2016. During this period, state and local arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent from 18,295 in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016. The vast majority of Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems rather than the federal system. However, more Native American youth were involved in the federal system than their percentage in the nationwide population (1.6 percent). For example, of all youth arrested by federal entities during the period, 18 percent were Native American. According to Department of Justice (DOJ) officials, this is due to federal jurisdiction over certain crimes involving Native Americans. Comprehensive data on Native American youth involvement in tribal justice systems were not available for analysis. GAO's analysis showed several differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, the majority of Native American youths' involvement was for offenses against a person, such as assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of non-Native American youths' involvement was for public order offenses (e.g., immigration violations) or drug or alcohol offenses. On the other hand, in state and local justice systems, the involvement of Native American and non-Native American youth showed many similarities, such as similar offenses for each group. DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offered at least 122 discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant programs) from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that could be used to address juvenile delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS made approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards to grantees during the period, of which the agencies awarded approximately $207.7 million to tribal governments or Native American organizations. Officials from the agencies, tribal governments, and Native American organizations identified factors they believe affect success in applying for grant programs. For example, some tribal governments and Native American organizations found being able to call or meet with federal officials during the application process helpful but found that short application deadlines are a challenge."], "length": 3025, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "32653016b3ed5a73c18e2a91ce74db9db8a55f1c7c005f56"}
{"input": "", "context": "In 1956, the Army began the development of a family of air-transportable, armored multi-purpose vehicles intended to provide a lightweight, amphibious armored personnel carrier for armor and mechanized infantry units. Known as the M-113, it entered production in 1960 and saw extensive wartime service in Vietnam. Considered a reliable and versatile vehicle, a number of different variations of the M-113 were produced to fulfill such roles as a command and control vehicle, mortar carrier, and armored ambulance, to name but a few. The Army began replacing the M-113 infantry carrier version in the early 1980s with the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, but many non-infantry carrier versions of the M-113 were retained in service. According to the Army The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the proposed United States Army program for replacement of the M-113 Family of Vehicles (FOV) to mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability by mission role variant within the Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) [now known as the Armored Brigade Combat Team – ABCT]. The AMPV will have multiple variants tailored to specific mission roles within HBCT. Mission roles are as follows: General Purpose, Medical Evacuation, Medical Treatment, Mortar Carrier, and Mission Command. AMPV is a vehicle integration program. Regarding the decision to replace remaining M-113s, the Army notes the following: The M-113 lacks the force protection and mobility needed to operate as part of combined arms teams within complex operational environments. For example, \"commanders will not allow them to leave Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) or enter contested areas without extensive mission protection and route clearance.\" The use of other vehicles for M-113 mission sets (casualty evacuations, for example) reduces unit combat effectiveness. The majority of the Army's M-113s are found in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), where they comprise 32% of the tracked armored vehicles organic to that organization. The 114 M-113 variants in the ABCT are distributed as follows: In addition to the AMPV requirement in the ABCTs, the Army also planned to procure an additional 1,922 AMPVs to replace M-113s in Echelons Above Brigade (EAB). The Army notes that these AMPVs might have different requirements than the ABCT AMPVs. DOD estimates if the M-113s are replaced by AMPVs at EAB, total program costs could be increased by an additional $6.5 billion. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), in March 2012, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD, AT&L) approved a materiel development decision for AMPV and authorized the Army's entry into the materiel solution analysis phase. The Army completed the AMPV analysis of alternatives (AoA) in July 2012 and proposed a nondevelopmental vehicle (the candidate vehicle will be either an existing vehicle or a modified existing vehicle—not a vehicle that is specially designed and not in current service). Because the AMPV is to be a nondevelopmental vehicle, DOD decided the program would start at Milestone B, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and skip the Milestone A, Technology Development Phase. The Army planned for a full and open competition and aimed to award one industry bidder a 42-month EMD contract to develop all five AMPV variants. A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) released in March 2013 stated the EMD contract would be worth $1.46 billion, including $388 million for 29 EMD prototypes for testing between 2014 and 2017 and $1.08 billion for 289 low-rate initial production (LRIP) models between 2018 and 2020. The Army had planned on releasing the formal RFP in June 2013 but instead slipped the date until mid-September 2013, citing a delayed Defense Acquisition Board review attributed in part to Department of Defense civilian furloughs. The EMD contract award was originally planned for late 2014. The Army planned for an average unit manufacturing cost (AUMC) of $1.8 million per vehicle. On November 26, 2013, DOD issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approving the Army's entry into the Milestone B, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase. The ADM directed the Army to impose an Average Procurement Unit Cost less than or equal to $3.2 million at a production rate of not less than 180 vehicles per year. In addition, operations and sustainment costs were to be less than or equal to $400,000 per vehicle per year. The Army was also directed to down select to a single prime contractor at the completion of Milestone B. Also on November 26, 2013, the Army issued a new draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the AMPV. This RFP stipulated the Army planned to award a five-year EMD contract in May 2014 worth $458 million to a single contractor for 29 prototypes. While the March 2013 RFP established an Average Unit Manufacturing Cost Ceiling for each AMPV at $1.8 million, this was rescinded to permit vendors greater flexibility. The EMD phase was scheduled to run between FY2015 and FY2019, followed by three years of low-rate initial production (LRIP) starting in 2020. On December 23, 2014, the Army announced it had selected BAE Systems Land and Armaments L.P. as the winner of the EMD contract. The initial award was for 52 months valued at about $382 million. During this period of performance, BAE was to produce 29 vehicles, which would be put through \"rigorous developmental and operational testing.\" In addition, the award provided for an optional low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase award in the future. If this phase is awarded, BAE would produce an additional 289 vehicles for a total contract value of $1.2 billion. The Army, in its announcement, emphasized the BAE EMD contract did not pertain to the 1,922 EAB AMPVs. According to reports, the AMPV successfully completed its Critical Design Review (CDR) on June 23, 2016. Successful completion of a CDR demonstrates the AMPV's design is stable, can be expected to meet established performance standards, and the program can be accomplished within its established budget. On December 15, 2016, BAE delivered the first general purpose AMPV to the Army for testing. The Army plans for six months of contractor tests, followed by one year of government testing and then Limited User Testing. In April 2018, BAE reportedly delivered all 29 AMPVs to the Army for testing. In September 2017, the Army reportedly started reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing for the AMPV. DOD defines RAM as follows: Reliability is the probability of an item to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time. Reliability is further divided into mission reliability and logistics reliability. Availability is a measure of the degree to which an item is in an operable state and can be committed at the start of a mission when the mission is called for at an unknown (random) point in time. Availability as measured by the user is a function of how often failures occur and corrective maintenance is required, how often preventive maintenance is performed, how quickly indicated failures can be isolated and repaired, how quickly preventive maintenance tasks can be performed, and how long logistics support delays contribute to down time. Maintainability is the ability of an item to be retained in, or restored to, a specified condition when maintenance is performed by personnel having specified skill levels, using prescribed procedures and resources, at each prescribed level of maintenance and repair. Due to budgetary constraints, the Army reportedly planned to provide upgraded EAB M-113s to a small number of units outside the continental United States and in South Korea and Europe. In August 2017, Army officials reportedly noted \"that the amount of time and resources it would take to achieve a pure fleet solution for both ABCTs and EAB units would likely push fielding into FY 2040 and beyond, which is not a suitable course of action.\" Officials also suggested that upgrading M-113s for EAB use was \"an interim solution until we can get to the optimal solution.\" The Army had planned to issue a request for proposal (RFP) for upgraded M-113s in the summer of 2018. A number of vendors, including General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), BAE Systems, and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), reportedly planned to respond to the RFP. Reportedly, on May 21, 2018, the Army indefinitely postponed its plans to upgrade EAB M-113s and also put on hold plans to issue an RFP for upgraded M-113s. In October 2018, Army leadership reportedly made the AMPV part of the Army's NGCV program, which is to be overseen by the Army's Futures Command (AFC). Previously, AMPV was overseen by the Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Ground Combat Systems (GCS), but program authority is now shared with the AFC's NGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT). Reportedly, the PEO GCS will retain acquisition legal authorities, but the CFT is to have input on requirements and acquisition schedule. The CFT is also to help prioritize corrective actions needed to address deficiencies identified during testing, as well as identify the resources that will be required. In December 2018, the AMPV program received approval to move into the Production and Deployment phase of acquisition. BAE Systems is to start the production of the first batch of 551 of a total of 2,907 AMPVs, with initial vehicle delivery early in 2020. The Army is expected to field 258 vehicles as part of the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) in FY2020 and two brigade sets' worth of AMPVs by the end of calendar year 2020. In January 2019, it was reported that the Army had decided to cancel M-113 replacement at echelons above brigade (EAB) and reprogram funding for higher priorities. At this point, it is not readily apparent how the Army plans to address its previous 1,922 EAB AMPV requirement. On March 13, 2019, Army leadership reportedly announced the Army had decided to cut funding over the next five years for 93 programs—including the AMPV—to increase available funding for its new modernization strategy. While the Army has yet to release its final five-year reduction plan, program officials reportedly stated that the AMPV's overall top-line requirement would likely remain unchanged, but the Army would likely slow the per-year procurement rate. An April 28, 2017, DOD IG report noted the Army has effectively managed the AMPV program, in particular keeping it within cost requirements and scheduled timeframes, but also expressed the following concerns: The program might not meet entry requirements for initial production and testing (Milestone C) because the Army has not fully resolved vehicle performance and design demonstration concerns. As a result of the aforementioned performance and design concerns, the AMPV could experience increased costs and schedule delays as a result of addressing the IG's concerns. Because the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff, Programming (G-8) had not revised the procurement quantities to reflect changes to the Army's equipment and force structure requirements, the program's estimated total cost and Average Procurement Unit Cost is not accurate. An April 2018 GAO Weapon Systems Annual Assessment expressed the following concerns: The program has experienced development contract cost growth of over 20 percent above target cost due to continued challenges meeting logistics, performance, and production requirements. However, program officials noted that the government's official cost position for AMPV development—based on the independent cost estimate prepared by the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation—has not changed as it includes adequate margin to account for the cost growth to date. AMPV remains dependent on other programs—such as the Army's Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit Radios—for its key communication and networking capabilities. However, these programs have experienced their own acquisition challenges delaying their availability for the AMPV program. The program is including a legacy radio platform in its production vehicle design configuration, which will, according to program officials, readily accommodate future networking capabilities provided by these other programs. Given the aforementioned 2017 DOD IG concerns and GAO's 2018 concerns regarding cost growth, difficulties meeting a variety of developmental requirements, and dependencies on other programs that are experiencing developmental challenges, the AMPV program will likely receive significant scrutiny and oversight to insure it remains a cost effective and viable program. DOT&E's FY2018 Annual Report noted the following: Preliminary observations of the Limited Users Test indicate the AMPV meets or exceeds its goal of replacing the M113 family of vehicles (FoV) with a more capable platform. The AMPV demonstrated superior power and mobility over the M113 FoV. The AMPV was able to maintain its position in the formation. The AMPV operational mission availability and reliability were far superior to the M113 FoV. The platform provides potential for growth for power demand. Having common parts among all the variants should improve overall availability. The Mission Command variant facilitates digital mission command. The Medical Treatment and Medical Evacuation variants provide improved patient care and treatment capability with a new capability of conducting treatment on the move. The following deﬁciencies, if uncorrected, could adversely aﬀect AMPV performance: The driver's and vehicle commander's displays would frequently lock up, and the reboots each took 10 minutes. Due to the physical size and location, the commander's weapons station degraded situational awareness of the vehicle commander. The Joint Battle Command Platform and radios in the Mission Command vehicle cannot be removed from their docking stations within the vehicle. This limits the ability of the command group to share a common operational picture when operating as a Tactical Operations Center. The capability to support analog operations is degraded without the stowage for mapboards and plotting boards. The Medical Evacuation vehicle seat stowage and litter lift are diﬃcult to use. (The program manager has identiﬁed a design change to correct this deﬁciency.) The Mortar Carrier's ammunition storage is not optimized to support the mortar system. There is water leakage from the hatch and the roof leaks, aﬀecting the electronics in all variants and patient care in the medical variants. The preliminary survivability assessment identified minor vehicle design vulnerabilities that the Program Office is addressing with the vendor in order to meet survivability and force protections requirements. The FY2020 budget request includes Research Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Procurement funding requests for the AMPV in both the Base and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budgets, as well as FY2020 requested quantities. The Army notes that FY2020 OCO funding will procure 66 AMPVs to support U.S. European Command's (USEUCOM's) requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI). As previously noted, the Army's optimal solution would be to replace EAB M-113s with AMPVs, but the Army felt that given current and projected budgetary constraints, only selected EAB units outside the continental United States and in South Korea and Europe would receive AMPVs while the remainder would receive upgraded M-113s as an interim solution. Reportedly, on May 21, 2018, the Army indefinitely postponed its plans to upgrade EAB M-113s and also put on hold plans to issue an RFP for upgraded M-113s. Reportedly in January 2019, the Army decided to cancel M-113 at EAB replacement efforts. Given the frequently changing nature of the Army's plans for addressing the replacement of legacy M-113s at EAB and the decision to cancel M-113 EAB replacement, it is not unreasonable to question if the Army has a clearly defined \"way ahead\" for addressing M-113s at EAB. Will the Army simply \"leave\" M-113s at EAB and continue to maintain them, will they replaced by another vehicle, or is the Army still trying to decide on a course of action and a program strategy? DOD's April 2017 IG report, while acknowledging effective management of the AMPV program, also raised fundamental concerns about performance and design, as well as inaccurate procurement quantities, which could adversely impact program costs. GAO's 2018 concerns regarding cost growth, difficulties meeting a variety of developmental requirements, and dependencies on other programs that are experiencing developmental challenges suggest that programmatic issues continue. DOT&E's 2018 findings noted a number of performance concerns as well. Given these concerns, a more in-depth examination of identified AMPV program deficiencies might prove beneficial for DOD and policymakers alike. As previously noted, on March 13, 2019, Army leadership reportedly announced the Army had decided to cut funding over the next five years for 93 programs—including the AMPV—to increase available funding for its new modernization strategy. While the Army is not expected to change its overall AMPV top-line requirement, it could slow the per- year procurement rate. Once the Army has finalized its revised modernization plan, including program cuts, it could be beneficial to provide policymakers with a revised overall AMPV procurement plan, as well as a new fielding plan for units—both Active and Reserves—designated to receive AMPVs. ", "answers": ["The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the Army's proposed replacement for the Vietnam-era M-113 personnel carriers, which are still in service in a variety of support capacities in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs). While M-113s no longer serve as infantry fighting vehicles, five variants of the M-113 are used as command and control vehicles, general purpose vehicles, mortar carriers, and medical treatment and evacuation vehicles. The AMPV is intended to be a nondevelopmental program (candidate vehicles will be either existing vehicles or modified existing vehicles—not vehicles that are specially designed and not currently in service). Some suggest a nondevelopmental vehicle might make it easier for the Army to eventually field this system to the force, as most of the Army's past developmental programs, such as the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), the Future Combat System (FCS), the Crusader self-propelled artillery system, and the Comanche helicopter, were cancelled before they could be fully developed and fielded. On November 26, 2013, the Army issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the AMPV. This RFP stipulated the Army planned to award a five-year Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in May 2014 worth $458 million to a single contractor for 29 prototypes.

{"input": "", "context": "The federal government is the nation's largest employer, with over two million workers employed in the United States, U.S. Territories, and foreign countries. A majority of these employees work in the competitive service of the executive branch. Applicants for competitive service positions compete with other applicants and are evaluated according to objective standards. The executive branch includes two other service classifications—the excepted service and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—with hiring and removal standards that diverge from those prescribed for the competitive service. Positions in the excepted service are specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute, by the President, or by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). SES positions are also not in the competitive service. The SES includes senior managerial, supervisory, and policy positions that are subject to a different pay scale, as well as different hiring and removal standards. This report examines the three service classifications, and reviews some of the central features and notable differences among these classifications. The competitive service consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, except the following: positions that are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute; positions to which appointments are made by presidential nomination for confirmation by the Senate, unless the Senate otherwise directs; and positions in the SES. The competitive service also includes non-executive branch positions and positions in the District of Columbia government that are specifically included in the competitive service by statute. OPM administers examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought[.]\" OPM identifies the relative weights for the subjects in an examination, and assigns numerical ratings on a 100-point scale. Applicants who meet the minimum requirements for entrance to an examination, such as citizenship and residence requirements, and are rated 70 or more in the examination are eligible for appointment in the competitive service. These individuals are placed on registers or lists of eligibles. When an agency seeks to fill a competitive service position, it requests a certificate of eligibles from OPM. This certificate is to include enough names from the top of the relevant register to allow an agency appointing official to consider at least three individuals for every position to be filled. The competitive service includes several types of appointments. An individual selected for a continuing position is generally appointed as a career-conditional employee subject to an initial one-year probationary period. After three continuous years of service in a career-conditional appointment, an employee will be converted to a career appointment. A term appointment is a nonpermanent appointment for a period of more than one year, but less than four years. An agency may make a term appointment when the need for an employee's services is not permanent, but involves a special project, extraordinary workload, or reorganization. A temporary appointment is a time-limited appointment for a period not to exceed one year. An agency may make a temporary appointment to fill a short-term position or meet an employment need that is scheduled to end within a specified timeframe. Employees in the competitive service are generally paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" The grades include 10 steps that provide for increasing rates of pay. An employee who has not reached the maximum pay rate for his or her position is generally advanced to the next step at specified intervals. General Schedule salaries are based on the principles that there is equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area, that any pay distinctions are based on work and performance, that federal pay rates are comparable with non-federal pay rates for the same level of work, and that any pay disparities between federal and non-federal employees should be eliminated. Employees in the competitive service who are not serving a probationary or trial period, or have completed one year of current continuous service in a position other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less, maintain specified notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. Before an agency may suspend such a qualifying employee for 14 days or less, the employee must be given an advance written notice that identifies the specific reasons for the suspension. The employee must also be provided a reasonable time to answer the notice and furnish affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Similar notice is required before an agency may subject a qualifying employee to other adverse personnel actions. Before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Unlike suspensions for 14 days or less, these adverse actions may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. In general, an agency must establish three factors to withstand an individual's challenge of his or her adverse personnel action. First, the agency must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the charged conduct occurred. Second, it must establish a nexus between that conduct and the efficiency of the civil service. Finally, the agency must show that the penalty imposed on the employee is reasonable. An agency's action may not be sustained if the appellant shows: (1) harmful error in applying the agency's procedures in arriving at its decision; (2) that the decision was based on a prohibited personnel practice; or (3) that the decision was not in accordance with law. About one-third of all federal workers are employed in the excepted service. The excepted service consists of those civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES. Positions in the excepted service may be designated by statute or by OPM, and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM will exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of certain students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. For example, OPM may determine that a position should be excepted from the competitive service because it is impracticable to examine the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for a position. Positions in the excepted service are categorized into four schedules. Schedule A includes positions that are not of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine applicants. Attorneys, chaplains, and short-term positions for which there is a critical hiring need are examples of schedule A positions. Schedule B also includes positions that are not of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine applicants. Unlike Schedule A positions, however, these positions require an applicant to satisfy basic qualification standards established by OPM for the relevant occupation and grade level. Individuals appointed to schedule B positions engage in a variety of activities, including policy analysis, teaching, and technical assistance. Positions in schedule C are policy-determining or involve a close and confidential working relationship with the head of an agency or other key appointed officials. These positions include most political appointees below the cabinet and subcabinet levels. An agency's senior advisor and special assistant positions are typically in schedule C. Finally, schedule D includes positions that are not of a confidential or policy-determining character for which competitive examination makes it difficult to recruit a sufficient number of certain students or recent graduates. Examples of schedule D positions include those involving science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) occupations and positions in the Presidential Management Fellows Program. Schedule D positions generally require an applicant to satisfy basic qualification standards established by OPM for the relevant occupation and grade level. Like employees in the competitive service, excepted service employees are generally paid in accordance with the General Schedule. In addition, excepted service employees maintain the same notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. Some employees in the excepted service, however, must satisfy different durational requirements before these rights become available. So-called \"preference eligibles\" in an executive agency, the Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission must complete one year of current continuous service to avail themselves of the relevant notice and appeal rights. The term \"preference eligible\" refers to specified military veterans and some of their family members, such as an unmarried widow, and the wife or husband of a service-connected disabled veteran. Employees in the excepted service who are not preference eligibles and (1) are not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, or (2) have completed two years of current or continuous service in the same or similar position, have the same notice and appeal rights as qualifying employees in the competitive service. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. While they are considered federal employees within the civil service system, the SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. As defined in statute, SES positions are generally managerial or supervisory positions that are classified above the GS-15 grade (or certain equivalent positions) and need not be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as intermediaries between top-level political appointees of an agency who seek to carry out the objectives of a particular President and career civil servants with institutional experience relating to relevant issues. According to a 2018 report, there are currently more than 7,000 permanent SES positions. There are two types of SES positions: (1) career reserved and (2) general. Career reserved positions must be filled with career appointees to shield certain SES roles from political influence. Generally, agency heads are to determine whether a particular SES position warrants a career reserved designation, to \"ensure impartiality, or the public's confidence in the impartiality, of the Government.\" OPM regulations reflect the types of SES roles in which this designation is appropriate, including those involving adjudication and appeals, auditing, and law enforcement duties. General positions may be filled by career appointees, as well as other noncareer and limited term (i.e., political) appointees. There are four types of SES appointments: career, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees. The SES mainly consists of \"career appointees\" chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process. As part of this process, each agency must maintain a recruitment program for career appointees, as well as at least one executive board that reviews qualifications and makes recommendations regarding SES candidates. An OPM-convened Qualification Review Board (QRB) must certify the executive and managerial qualifications of a selected candidate before a career appointment may be made to an SES position. Unlike career appointees, noncareer appointees are not subject to the competitive selection process, but agency heads must determine that these appointees meet the qualifications of the SES position. While noncareer appointees are not QRB-certified, OPM must approve these appointees. Limited term and limited emergency appointees make up a small subset of the SES, and their terms are non-renewable. These appointments are used when a position is needed for a specified period (such as to manage a special project), or a position is established to meet a \"bona fide, unanticipated, urgent need.\" Limited term and limited emergency appointments are also subject to OPM approval. To restrict the politicization of the SES, Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees who may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is also distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that the pay rate of each senior executive is based on the executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a \"rigorous\" performance appraisal system. Each federal agency must maintain at least one of these appraisal systems, subject to OPM standards, review, and approval. Performance appraisals of SES members may consider factors such as improvements in efficiency, productivity, and quality of work or service, cost efficiency, and performance timeliness. In response to earlier concerns that SES appraisal systems were flawed because most executives received the highest rating, Title 5 tasks OPM, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget, with the establishment and maintenance of a government-wide performance appraisal system certification process, in an effort to ensure that an agency's appraisal systems for SES employees make \"meaningful distinctions based on relative performance.\" Title 5 also sets out different pay rates for the SES, with a minimum rate of basic pay equal to 120 percent of the rate for GS-15, step 1, and a maximum rate of basic pay equal to the rate for Level III of the Executive Schedule. But SES members' annual aggregate pay (that includes additional compensation such as bonuses, awards, and other payments in addition to basic pay) is capped at the rate for Level I of the Executive Schedule. If a senior executive's total compensation exceeds the aggregate limitation, the executive receives the overage in the following calendar year. To encourage federal agencies to establish and maintain an OPM-certified performance appraisal system, Title 5 allows for a higher range of SES pay for agencies that have these certified systems. Title 5 also articulates conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. Career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons. For example, an SES career appointee may be removed from the civil service or suspended for more than 14 days only for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function. SES members must receive advance written notice about the action and opportunity to provide an answer or receive hearing, subject to exception. The senior executive may also appeal the employment action to the MSPB. A career appointee receiving a single unsatisfactory performance rating may be reassigned or transferred within the SES or removed from the SES. A career SES member who receives two unsatisfactory ratings in any period of five consecutive years, or twice in any period of three consecutive years receives less than fully successful ratings, must be removed from the SES. Affected SES career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions. While these appointees may not appeal these actions to the MSPB, they may request an informal hearing before the Board. SES career appointees are also generally entitled to be placed in a civil service position at GS-15 or above (or an equivalent position). In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same removal protections and may be removed from the SES at any time. The procedures for removal of noncareer and limited term appointees are largely not addressed in federal statute, and the terms and procedures for their removal are mainly at the discretion of the agency head. In response to concerns about performance and accountability of SES members employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Congress recently created special removal requirements that apply to these positions. In 2017, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which amended an existing provision concerning removal procedures for these covered senior executives. Under the 2017 Act, the VA Secretary has discretion to suspend, demote, remove, or take other actions against SES career appointees or other high-level executives if the Secretary determines that the individual's misconduct or performance warrants such action. To address SES job performance issues more expeditiously, SES employees at the VA Department are entitled to abbreviated notice and appeals rights, as compared to the removal procedures in place in other federal agencies.", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "length": 3383, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "db16fc26b2d7fe46dfad58d4022c88cd1b7e50270b9e8fbc"}
{"input": "", "context": "Our work has shown that when grants management requirements are duplicative, unnecessarily burdensome, and conflicting, agencies must direct resources toward meeting them—which can make the agency’s programs and services less cost effective and increase burden for grant recipients. For example, in 2016, we reviewed administrative requirements for federal research grants. Officials from universities and stakeholder organizations we interviewed identified common factors that added to their administrative workload and costs for complying with selected requirements. These factors included: variation in agencies’ implementation of requirements, pre-award requirements for applicants to develop and submit detailed documentation for grant proposals, and increased prescriptiveness of certain requirements. We have also reported on a number of initiatives intended to address the challenges grantees encounter throughout the grants lifecycle. These initiatives include consolidating and revising grants management circulars, simplifying the pre-award phase, promoting shared information technology solutions for grants management, and improving the timeliness of grant closeout and reducing undisbursed balances. Our work includes reviews of efforts to submit the Consolidated Federal Financial Report through a single system and to standardize notices of award to reduce reporting burden. In addition, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a pilot program to develop recommendations for reducing reporting burden for recipients of federal awards. In 2016 and 2017, we reported on the design and implementation of the OMB pilot program, known as the Section 5 Pilot, aimed at developing recommendations for reducing reporting burden for grant recipients and contractors. We made a number of recommendations to improve the design of the Section 5 Pilot to ensure its consistency with leading practices for pilot design, which OMB has implemented. We continue to monitor implementation of the Section 5 Pilot through ongoing work and look forward to keeping the subcommittee informed about our findings. To provide increased transparency to agencies, Congress, and the public, the DATA Act required OMB, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and other federal agencies to increase the types of information available on the more than $3.7 trillion in annual federal spending, including federal spending on grants. The law requires OMB and Treasury to establish data standards to enable the reporting and tracking of agency spending at multiple points in the spending lifecycle. Since enactment, OMB, Treasury, and federal agencies have addressed many of the policy and technical challenges presented by the act’s requirements, including standardizing data elements across the federal government, linking data contained in agencies’ financial and award systems, and expanding the types of data reported. However, in a 2017 report, we found inconsistencies in key award data elements and issues with the completeness and quality of the information reported. We made a number of recommendations to OMB and Treasury to clarify guidance to help agencies fully comply with DATA Act requirements and report accurate data and to disclose known data quality issues. OMB and Treasury generally agreed with our recommendations. Once the accuracy of these data are improved, federal managers should be better able to make data driven decisions to address ongoing government management challenges and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs. The process of distributing federal assistance through grants is complicated and involves many different parties—both public and private—with different organizational structures, sizes, and missions. A lack of collaboration among and between federal agencies, state and local governments, and nongovernmental grant participants presents a challenge to effective grants implementation. Given the complexity of managing intergovernmental grants, collaboration among the grant participants, particularly with regard to information sharing, is an important factor in effective grants management. For example, one of the lessons learned in our work on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) is that increased accountability requirements and aggressive timelines require coordination—both vertically among levels of government and horizontally within the same level of government—to share information and work toward common goals during implementation. Intra- and intergovernmental networks facilitated efforts to achieve the purposes of the act in an effort to efficiently and effectively spend the grant funds. Our work on interagency grants management reform initiatives also found that inadequate ongoing communication with grantees sometimes resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of initiatives. Our 2014 work on the Recovery Act illustrated how agencies can effectively approach ongoing communication. For example, the developers of Recovery.gov used input from user forums, focus groups, and usability testing with interested citizens to collect feedback and recommendations. This information then informed the development of the website from its initial stages. More recently, in our 2014 work on the DATA Act, we have noted OMB and Treasury efforts to allow the public to share their views and comment on the development of federal data standards. Our prior work has shown that numerous federal grant programs created over time without coordinated purposes and scope can result in grants management challenges. Addressing these challenges may achieve cost savings and result in greater efficiencies in grant programs. Our work has underscored the importance of identifying fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in a number of federal programs, including grants management practices. For example, in January 2017, we found that the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Food and Nutrition Service, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not established guidance and formal processes to avoid duplication and overlap among grants in their agencies before awarding grants. We recommended that these agencies do so, and they agreed. In response, these agencies have taken a number of actions to address the recommendation. For example, the Department of the Interior provided us documentation showing that the Fish and Wildlife Service now requires that discretionary grant applicants provide a statement that addresses whether there is any overlap or duplication of proposed projects or activities to be funded by the grant. The Fish and Wildlife Service also updated its guidance to grant awarding offices instructing them to perform a potential overlap and duplication review of all selected applicants prior to making grant awards. Our prior work has shown that when awarding and managing federal grants, effective oversight and internal control is important to provide reasonable assurance to federal managers and taxpayers that grants are awarded properly, recipients are eligible, and federal grant funds are used as intended and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control comprises the plans, methods, and procedures agencies use to be reasonably assured that their missions, goals, and objectives can be met. In numerous reviews, we and agency inspectors general identified weaknesses in agencies’ internal controls for managing and overseeing grants. Specifically, we found that when such controls are weak, federal grant-making agencies face challenges in achieving grant program goals and assuring the proper and effective use of federal funds to help avoid improper payments. Our work has identified weaknesses in grants oversight and accountability issues that span the government including undisbursed grant award balances, single audit submissions that are late, and significant levels of improper payments in grant programs. Key grants management challenges related to internal controls and oversight that we have identified include: Timeliness of grant closeouts. Federal grant-making agencies must close out grants when the grantee’s period of performance has ended in order to ensure that grantees have met all financial requirements and provide final reports as required. Closing out grants also allows agencies to identify and redirect unused funds to other projects and priorities as authorized or to return unspent balances to the Treasury. These accounts, and, in some cases, the undisbursed balances associated with them, persisted as an issue for agencies, as we reported in 2008, 2012, and 2016. In January 2016, the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act (GONE Act) was signed into law. The act, passed in part in response to our work, required government- wide reporting of undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts. The GONE Act requires that agencies report on the grants for which the grantee’s period of performance had expired for more than 2 years, including those with undisbursed balances and with zero dollar balances remaining in the accounts. In the fall of 2017, many agencies included in their annual Agency Financial Reports an appendix providing information required by the GONE Act. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported almost $2 billion in undisbursed funds remaining in 16,603 grant accounts that were two years or more past their periods of performance and 6,512 grant accounts that had no funds remaining in them. HHS grant officials told us that they intend to close as many of these grant accounts as possible during this fiscal year. Timely submission of single audits. As we have previously reported, one key way that federal agencies oversee nonfederal grantees is through an audit of their expenditures of federal awards, referred to as a single audit. The single audit is an audit of the award recipient’s expenditure of federal awards and of its financial statements. A single audit can identify deficiencies in the award recipient’s compliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements and in its financial management and internal control systems. Correcting such deficiencies can help reasonably assure the effective use of federal funds and reduce federal improper payments. In 2017, we reported that of the five departments we reviewed—the Departments of Agriculture, Education, HHS, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation—some of the departments’ subagencies did not effectively design policies and procedures to reasonably assure the timely submission of single audit reports by award recipients. In this report, we made 21 recommendations to these departments. Some action has been taken to date in response to these recommendations. Avoiding improper payments of federal grants. As we have previously reported, improper payments—payments that should not have been made or that were made in an incorrect amount—have consistently been a government-wide issue. Since fiscal year 2003— when certain agencies were required by statute to begin reporting estimated improper payments for certain programs and activities— cumulative improper payment estimates have totaled about $1.4 trillion. Our reviews of Medicaid, a joint federal-state health care program and significant source of federal grant funding to state governments, have shown that the program is particularly vulnerable to improper payments, given its size, diversity, and complexity. For example, Medicaid accounted for more than 26 percent ($36.7 billion) of the nearly $141 billion government-wide improper payment estimate in fiscal year 2017. We have also reported that federal spending for Medicaid is expected to significantly increase, so it is especially critical that appropriate measures be taken to reduce improper payments in this program. Recent and proposed legislative- and executive-sponsored initiatives aimed at grants management reform, present opportunities to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of federal grants. Our work on the design and implementation of merit-based grant award selection and initiatives to manage for results across the federal government has highlighted a number of key features necessary to effectively implement such crosscutting initiatives. Those features include: Establishing implementation goals and tracking progress. Our work highlighted the importance of establishing an implementation schedule and tracking progress toward priorities to help pinpoint performance shortfalls and suggest midcourse corrections, including any needed adjustments to future priorities and milestones. Identifying and agreeing on leadership roles and responsibilities. Our work has shown that when interagency councils clarify who will do what, identify how to organize their joint and individual efforts, and articulate steps for decision making, they enhance their ability to work together and achieve results. Developing an effective communication strategy. We reported on the importance of two-way communication that allows for feedback from relevant stakeholders. For example, our work showed that grantees felt that a lack of opportunities to provide timely feedback resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of streamlining initiatives and limited grantees’ use and understanding of new functionality of electronic systems. In addition, given the number and diversity of grantor agencies and grantmaking programs, we believe it is important that any grant reform initiative integrate with other government-wide reform efforts on related issues. One such reform initiative is the PMA, which lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the federal government and improving the ability of agencies to achieve results. The PMA identified a set of CAP goals to target areas where multiple agencies must collaborate to effect change and report progress in a manner the public can easily track. According to the PMA, one of the goals included in the agenda—the Results- Oriented Accountability for Grants CAP goal—is intended to maximize the value of grant funding by applying a risk-based data-driven framework that balances compliance requirements with demonstrating successful results for taxpayers. The PMA further states that this CAP goal seeks to standardize grant reporting data and improve data collection in ways that will increase efficiency, promote evaluation, and reduce reporting burden. Effectively advancing results-oriented accountability for grants will require that implementation of this CAP goal moves forward in tandem with related efforts to implement the DATA Act and advance the use of evidence to inform grant policy, highlighted below: DATA Act implementation. As our work has shown, the DATA Act will continue to be a critical driver of grants management change and reform. When fully implemented, the act will improve the accountability and transparency of federal spending data by (1) establishing government-wide financial data standards so that data are comparable across agencies and (2) holding federal agencies more accountable for the quality of the information disclosed. Such increased transparency provides opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of federal spending; increasing the accessibility of data to benefit the public and the business community; and improving oversight to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. As efforts to implement the DATA Act move forward, we will continue to monitor implementation efforts and coordinate our efforts with agency inspectors general. Evidence-based policy. To better integrate evidence and rigorous evaluation in budget, management, operational, and policy decisions, OMB has encouraged federal agencies to expand or improve the use of grant program designs that focus federal dollars on effective practices while encouraging innovation in service delivery. For example, OMB’s efforts to foster a culture of evidence-based policy resulted in several federal agencies’ implementation of tiered evidence grant programs. Under this approach, agencies establish tiers of grant funding based on the level of evidence of effectiveness provided for a grantee’s service model. Agencies award smaller amounts to promising service models with a smaller evidence base, while providing larger amounts to those with more supporting evidence. In our 2016 report, we recommended that OMB establish a formal means for federal agencies to collaborate on tiered evidence grants. In response, in 2017, OMB launched the Tiered Evidence Grants Working Group to collaborate and share lessons learned, for example, on the use and dissemination of evaluation results. These efforts should complement each other. A lack of integration could result in duplication of effort or run the risk of working at cross-purposes. For example, the integration of the Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants CAP goal with ongoing DATA Act implementation and efforts to advance evidence-based approaches to federal grant funding and administration presents a complex governance challenge. In conclusion, designing and implementing grants management policies that strike an appropriate balance between ensuring accountability for the proper use of federal funds without increasing the complexity and cost of grants administration for agencies and grantees is a longstanding governance challenge. As the initiatives above demonstrate, meeting this challenge and successfully implementing grants management reforms will require intragovernmental coordination at the federal level, intergovernmental collaboration with state and local governments and other partners, and ongoing integration to ensure that grants management reforms and related DATA Act and evidence-based policy implementation efforts are complementary and do not exist in separate silos. We look forward to continuing our ongoing work to review implementation of the CAP goals, the DATA Act, and the infusion of evidence-based policy in federal grant programs. We also look forward to working with this and other committees as we assist Congress in identifying additional opportunities to advance grants management reform through reviews of individual grant programs and crosscutting analysis of grant implementation and grants management reform efforts.

GAO's previous work has found that growth in both the number of grant programs and level of funding has increased the diversity of federal grants to state and local governments. GAO's work has also found that designing and implementing grants management policies that strike an appropriate balance between ensuring accountability for the proper use of federal funds without increasing the complexity and cost of grants administration for agencies and grantees presents a governance challenge. At the same time, several government-wide initiatives hold promise for advancing the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of federal grants. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports on federal grants management and crosscutting issues related to managing for results across the federal government issued between 2005 and 2018. It addresses: (1) GAO's observations on long-standing challenges for federal grants management, and (2) opportunities to effectively advance current grant modernization initiatives. GAO has identified challenges to federal grants management in its work spanning several decades. These challenges include: Streamlining: Grants management requirements that are duplicative, unnecessarily burdensome, and conflicting require agencies to direct resources toward meeting them and can burden recipients of federal grants. GAO has reported on initiatives to streamline these requirements and address challenges grantees encounter throughout the grants lifecycle. Transparency: The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) required the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the Treasury, and other federal agencies to increase the types of information available on federal spending, including grants. GAO has reported on progress in standardizing and expanding reported data, but has found inconsistencies with the completeness and quality of the reported information. Collaboration and consultation: Collaboration, particularly information sharing, is an important factor in effective grants management. GAO's work on interagency grants management reform initiatives found that inadequate ongoing communication with grantees sometimes resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of initiatives. Duplication, overlap, and fragmentation : Agencies' grants management practices, such as requirements to avoid duplication and overlap among grants before awarding them, can help agencies achieve cost savings and result in greater efficiencies in grant programs. Internal controls and oversight : GAO's work has identified weaknesses in grants oversight and accountability. For example, GAO has identified opportunities for agencies to more consistently close out grants when the grantee's period of performance has ended to ensure that grantees have met all requirements and identified opportunities to redirect or return unused funds. Recent and proposed initiatives aimed at grants management reform present opportunities to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of federal grants. GAO's work on federal grants management and managing for results has highlighted a number of key features for effectively implementing such crosscutting initiatives, which include: (1) establishing implementation goals and tracking progress, (2) identifying and agreeing on leadership roles and responsibilities, and (3) developing an effective communication strategy. Further, given the number and diversity of grantor agencies and grant programs, it is important that any grant reform initiative integrate with other government-wide reform efforts on related issues across government, such as the grants-related Cross-Agency Priority goal, implementation of the DATA Act, and initiatives related to evidence-based policy. These efforts can be effective if they complement each other rather than run the risk of operating independently and potentially duplicating effort or working at cross-purposes."], "length": 3880, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "cb54f1c0ff19c8db20adc2dbe42b0e52ab5898d99a123a38"}
{"input": "", "context": "ARPA-E’s typical funding announcement and award selection process begins with the agency hiring a program director responsible for identifying a gap in energy technology research and developing a program to fill that gap. ARPA-E is required by statute to achieve its goals through energy technology projects that, among other things, accelerate transformational technological advances in areas that industry on its own is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty, while also ensuring that its activities are coordinated with, and do not duplicate the efforts of, programs and laboratories within DOE and other relevant research agencies. ARPA-E’s efforts to identify existing energy technology research gaps and to design a program to address those gaps involve research; consultation with scientific experts, including a workshop with outside experts; and internal discussions within ARPA-E. From this process, program directors develop funding opportunity announcements that describe the technical requirements specific to each program’s technology area that applicants have to meet, as well as the four standard criteria that ARPA-E uses to guide its merit selection process. Following the issuance of a funding opportunity announcement, ARPA-E employs the following multi-stage process to merit review applications, make funding award decisions, and monitor projects: Concept paper. Applicants initially submit a 4- to 7-page abstract of their projects. Scientific experts from government, industry, and academia serve as reviewers. Full application. After reviewing concept papers, ARPA-E encourages some applicants to submit full applications. Full applications are generally quite extensive, requesting information on the technical and financial aspects of the proposed project, among other things. ARPA-E officials we interviewed noted that these applications are frequently more than 100 pages and can take 30 to 45 days for the applicant to develop. Full applications are reviewed against the selection criteria by leading scientific experts in the relevant field and assigned numerical scores. Reply to reviewer comments. After reviewing a full application, reviewers provide comments and questions to the applicants, who then have the opportunity to respond. Selection. A three- to four-person panel, chaired by the relevant ARPA-E program director, considers the reviewers’ comments and numerical scores and recommends applications for an award. The final decisions on which applicants to select for award negotiations are made by the selecting official, usually the Director of ARPA-E. Award negotiations. Once selections are made, ARPA-E program directors work closely with selectees to negotiate the terms and conditions of their award. These negotiations include, among other things, developing a project plan with technical milestones that are to be met during the 2 to 3 years that the award is being funded, a budget and management plan, and an intellectual property and data management plan. Funds are awarded once negotiations regarding the terms and conditions of the award are concluded. ARPA-E seeks to complete negotiations regarding the terms and conditions of an award within approximately 100 days of sending a letter notifying an applicant that they have been selected for award negotiations. Selectees may be allowed to begin spending money to start work on their projects up to 90 days prior to the completion of award negotiations. However, these expenditures are made with the risk that applicants may not be reimbursed if award negotiations are unsuccessful and ARPA-E does not fund the award. Monitoring. ARPA-E monitors and supports the projects it funds through quarterly reviews and site visits. At any point during the award, ARPA-E may decide whether to continue or terminate the project based on whether agreed-upon project milestones are being met. In 2017, DOE developed and implemented a new review process to assess DOE financial assistance for new work against the current administration’s priorities, including financial assistance for which ARPA- E had already made award selections. DOE reviewed and approved ARPA-E’s opportunities for financial assistance on a rolling basis from May to September 2017, and nearly all were approved to proceed. The formal review of DOE financial assistance officially began on May 4, 2017, when DOE’s Chief of Staff issued a memorandum stating that funding opportunity announcements and determinations of non- competitive financial assistance would be reviewed to ensure consistency with the administration’s priorities. According to the memorandum, DOE agencies that award financial assistance—referred to in this report as funding organizations—were to provide information about each competitively selected funding announcement and determination of non- competitive financial assistance by May 15, 2017. This information included, for example, a brief description of the financial assistance, the number and amount of planned awards, and the technology readiness level of the projects being funded. DOE Office of Management officials told us that the agency’s financial assistance review lasted through September 2017, as some DOE organizations continued to submit new financial assistance for review, but that the review was largely completed by August 10, 2017. However, while the formal review of DOE financial assistance began in May, award negotiations for ARPA-E-funded projects were suspended nearly 1 month earlier. Specifically, according to ARPA- E officials, DOE’s Deputy Chief of Staff verbally directed ARPA-E on April 6, 2017 to stop all ongoing award negotiations. Figure 1 shows the timeline of DOE’s review of ARPA-E financial assistance. Pursuant to the DOE Chief of Staff’s May 4th memorandum, ARPA-E and other DOE funding organizations submitted the requested information to the DOE review team, which was coordinated and facilitated by the Director of DOE’s Office of Management. Other members of the financial assistance review team included DOE’s acting Chief Financial Officer; deputy assistant secretaries, chiefs of staff, and senior advisors at several DOE funding organizations; and members of the department’s congressional affairs and public affairs staff. According to DOE Office of Management officials we interviewed, the review team assessed the department’s financial assistance against five criteria: Whether the financial assistance was statutorily mandated; Whether the financial assistance was described in congressional Whether the financial assistance was consistent with administration priorities, as identified in budget documents and other statements from the President and Secretary of Energy, among other things; What technology readiness level the financial assistance was intended to fund; and Whether the technology encompassed by the project was already being funded by the private sector or others. DOE Office of Management officials stated that the review team did not use the above criteria to assign quantitative scores to evaluate the department’s financial assistance; instead, the team collaboratively discussed each opportunity for assistance. In most cases, the review team was able to reach consensus on whether the financial assistance aligned with the administration’s priorities. DOE Office of Management officials also noted that they met with ARPA-E leadership to obtain additional information about ARPA-E financial assistance on three occasions during the course of the review. ARPA-E officials said that, in addition to those three meetings, they provided written information to address questions received from the review team and to provide additional context regarding ARPA-E financial assistance. In total, DOE’s review team assessed 6 ARPA-E fiscal year 2017 or prior- year funding opportunity announcements for which applicants had been selected for award negotiation, 7 fiscal year 2017 announcements in the earlier stages of the merit review and selection process, 2 fiscal year 2017 announcements that had not yet been released, and 17 opportunities for financial assistance where ARPA-E funded renewals or new work under a determination of noncompetitive financial assistance. According to DOE Office of Management officials, the review team worked as quickly as possible to review all of DOE’s financial assistance to minimize potential disruptions for recipients and DOE’s funding organizations. Once the review team approved an opportunity for financial assistance, DOE funding organizations were allowed to resume work, DOE Office of Management officials told us. Figure 2 shows the total cumulative funds for ARPA-E financial assistance approved by the review committee at various stages in the review. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the review team approved roughly $158.3 million (55.6 percent) of ARPA-E’s proposed financial assistance on May 18, 2017, 3 days after the deadline for DOE funding organizations to submit information to the review team. The remaining proposed financial assistance was approved in several stages from June through August 2017. As of August 25, 2017, all of ARPA-E’s competitively selected funding opportunity announcements, renewals, and determinations for noncompetitive financial assistance, where selectees had been selected for negotiation, were approved by the review team, representing roughly $265 million, or 93.1 percent, of all ARPA-E funding reviewed by the team. DOE Office of Management officials also stated that the financial assistance review team made a decision early in the course of the review to honor all existing DOE commitments to fund new work. These officials said that this extended to commitments made to entities that had been selected for award negotiations, even though the department does not officially commit to providing funds until such negotiations are completed and the award is finalized. However, according to ARPA-E selectees we interviewed, this message was generally not communicated to them, which led to uncertainty about whether their projects would be funded. In contrast, the review team recommended that the DOE Chief of Staff cancel ARPA-E’s Facsimile Appearance to Create Energy Savings funding announcement, which had accepted full applications but had not selected any applicants for award negotiation. This opportunity would have funded the development of advanced information technology that could allow for three-dimensional digital representation of a person in a room nearly indistinguishable from the person being there in real life, which might allow for increased telecommuting. DOE Office of Management officials told us that the review team reached this recommendation in part because this technology was already being funded by the private sector. As of November 2017, DOE Office of Management officials said the review team had cancelled 3 other DOE funding announcements as a result of the review. According to information we collected, DOE’s review of ARPA-E financial assistance, as part of the DOE-wide review process, did not require the President to send a special message under the Impoundment Control Act. Specifically, the delay in obligating ARPA-E funds for financial assistance examined through DOE’s review process was for programmatic reasons. DOE officials explained that the purpose of the review was to ensure that the agency’s financial assistance aligned with the priorities of the current administration. According to the 10 ARPA-E selectees we interviewed, DOE’s financial assistance review process created uncertainty, which led to a variety of impacts—the most frequently cited of which were potentially delayed project timelines and difficulties staffing project teams. Selectees told us that they received little communication from ARPA-E during the review process, and they indicated that additional information about review timelines and potential effects on their awards would have helped them manage some of the uncertainty they experienced during the review process. DOE Office of Management officials said the fiscal year 2017 review process helped to better identify and coordinate future financial assistance department-wide on crosscutting issues. DOE is conducting the fiscal year 2018 review process prior to publicly issuing funding announcements. As a result, DOE Office of Management officials said, the delays and uncertainty that selectees experienced in fiscal year 2017 should be reduced. In our structured interviews with ARPA-E selectees, the most frequently cited impact of the uncertainty caused by DOE’s financial assistance review was the potential need to delay project timelines. All of the ARPA- E selectees we interviewed told us that they might need to extend their project timelines because of uncertainty caused by DOE’s review. Four of these selectees noted that the delay caused by DOE’s review could cause additional, cascading delays in their timelines. For example, 1 selectee we interviewed said that it would need to re-issue a hiring announcement it had publicized prior to the review because the review prevented it from hiring someone. In addition, the selectee would need to resubmit the hiring announcement to the university and state human resources departments for approval, which could take months to process. Another selectee said that it missed 2 months of a 3-month planting season because it could not start project work, and had the delay lasted any longer, the selectee would have missed an entire year of data collection on the project. Selectees also cited challenges to staffing project teams as a result of the uncertainty caused by the review. Selectees stated that delays caused by the review affected their ability to hire team members they had planned to hire based on their original schedule, as potential members moved on to other projects or took different jobs. For example, 9 selectees told us that they delayed hiring new project team members while DOE’s review was occurring. Four selectees we interviewed said that they had difficulty retaining staff during the review process. For example, 1 selectee had to lay off 2 of the company’s 15 staff members because of the delay in receiving funding, and several other staff members left voluntarily. Furthermore, the selectee said laying off these staff members resulted in an increase in the company’s unemployment taxes, which was expensive for a small-sized company. Four other selectees that we interviewed said they had to assign existing project team members to other funded work or general activities because they could not begin work on their ARPA-E project until they received funding. Selectees we interviewed cited additional impacts associated with the uncertainty caused by DOE’s financial assistance review. These impacts included: Delaying equipment purchases. Four selectees reported that they had to delay purchasing important equipment needed to execute their project. One selectee noted that the delay caused by the review was long enough that price quotes it had received from equipment sellers expired, and that prices could increase in later quotes. Changes to project scope. Two selectees told us that they might need to limit the planned scope of their projects to be able to complete them in the proposed timeline. For example, 1 selectee said its project involves helping to scale up three to four different technologies a year, which it might not be able to do if it has to adhere to its initial timeframes. Loss of advantage against potential competitors. Four of the selectees we interviewed said that the delay may have caused their technology to fall behind their potential competitors in some way. For example, 1 selectee noted that it was working in a competitive environment for its technology, with ongoing efforts in multiple countries, and reported that its project might have fallen behind others’ efforts as a result of delays associated with DOE’s review. However, 4 other selectees said that the review was not likely to cause any loss of competitiveness. Impacts on external project partners. Three selectees noted that DOE’s review caused uncertainty for partners on their projects, including partners that provide external funding. For example, 1 selectee told us that private investors in its technology area are most active in the fall and that its project team might not be able to seek a second round of funding if it could not demonstrate the necessary technical results of the project by then. Impacts on pre-award spending reimbursements. One selectee reported that it had to cease certain pre-award spending. The selectee said that it spent roughly $10,000 on equipment and 150 hours of labor prior to DOE’s financial assistance review, but it could not submit invoices for these expenditures to ARPA-E while the review was ongoing and would not be able to if its project was ultimately not approved. Furthermore, the selectee said that even if the award was approved, the delay might result in expenditures falling outside the 90-day window of allowable pre-award expenditures, which would require obtaining approval from ARPA-E to be reimbursed. Selectees we interviewed also stated that they received little communication from ARPA-E during the review, which contributed to the uncertainty about the status of their projects. Specifically, 6 of the selectees said that they would have liked additional information from ARPA-E on a variety of topics related to the review. For example, 4 selectees said they would have liked additional information about the review timeline and when it was planned to be completed. One of these selectees told us that a written document from ARPA-E indicating a rough time frame and next steps would have helped facilitate better planning for their project team. Two selectees we interviewed wanted additional information about whether they could renegotiate their timelines once the review was completed. Three selectees told us that they would have liked additional information about whether the review would cause them to lose their funding. ARPA-E officials we interviewed told us that they made three separate requests to DOE’s Deputy Chief of Staff to learn what they could communicate to selectees about the April 6, 2017, verbal order and the review process. ARPA-E officials told us that they were directed by the Deputy Chief of Staff not to communicate with selectees about the verbal order until receiving guidance from his office. ARPA-E developed proposed language to share with selectees but did not receive approval from the Deputy Chief of Staff to distribute it. DOE Office of Management officials we interviewed told us that they did not issue guidance to ARPA- E or other DOE funding organizations about how the organizations should communicate with selectees during the review. In contrast to its fiscal year 2017 review, DOE began its 2018 financial assistance review in August 2017, prior to publicly issuing funding announcements. On August 10, 2017, DOE’s Office of Management sent an email to DOE funding organizations directing them to submit descriptions of their proposed financial assistance by September 8, 2017. Because the review will occur prior to publicly issuing funding opportunity announcements, and thus before any recipients apply or are selected, DOE Office of Management officials said the delays and uncertainty that selectees experienced in fiscal year 2017 should be reduced. DOE Office of Management officials told us that—aside from changing the timing of its 2018 financial assistance review—the review team’s membership and evaluation criteria will be largely the same as for the fiscal year 2017 review. The officials said that they discussed the review process with senior leaders in DOE’s funding organizations to help ensure that they understood the priorities, expectations, and steps of the review process. The officials also told us that the review team developed additional guidance to clarify certain issues that arose during the fiscal year 2017 review. This additional guidance included: On August 17, 2017, funding organization managers were informed that continuation awards—those where the activity is presently being funded—would be exempt from submission to the review team and can continue to move forward. On August 29, 2017, funding organizations were informed that they should identify financial assistance that falls under one of seven crosscutting research issue areas. According to DOE Office of Management officials we interviewed, a key benefit of the fiscal year 2017 review process was that the review team noticed that DOE had several funding announcements at multiple funding organizations related to these areas. DOE’s funding organizations may be able to coordinate to issue a consolidated funding announcement in these crosscutting research issue areas, to ensure efforts are complementary and not duplicative. Furthermore, DOE Office of Management officials we interviewed said that knowing which funding organizations are funding work in these areas will support DOE meetings on crosscutting issues. We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the Secretary of Energy. DOE provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.

Since 2009, ARPA-E has awarded approximately $1.3 billion to universities, public and private companies, and national laboratories to fund energy research projects. Starting in May 2017, DOE began reviewing its financial assistance department-wide, including ARPA-E's, to determine if it met the administration's priorities. GAO was asked to examine this review process as it pertained to ARPA-E. This report describes (1) how DOE implemented the financial assistance review process; and (2) the perspectives of ARPA-E selectees on the impacts of the review process. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials at ARPA-E and DOE's Office of Management, which coordinated the review. GAO also interviewed a nonprobability sample of 10 of the 68 ARPA-E award selectees whose financial assistance was evaluated under the review. GAO identified selectees to interview based on representation across ARPA-E's recipient types, including universities, private companies, and national laboratories, among other criteria. While the views of selectees GAO interviewed cannot be generalized to all affected ARPA-E selectees, they provide illustrative examples of the effects of DOE's review. The Department of Energy (DOE) developed and implemented a new process to review its financial assistance to ensure that all new work funded by the department—including by DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)—was consistent with the current administration's priorities. The review process covered funding opportunity announcements as well as certain other types of financial assistance. New awards were delayed until the review of the underlying financial assistance opportunity was completed. DOE reviewed and approved ARPA-E's financial assistance on a rolling basis from May through September 2017, and nearly all ARPA-E financial assistance was approved. DOE Office of Management officials met with ARPA-E officials on several occasions to discuss their review of ARPA-E financial assistance. DOE officials GAO interviewed said they wanted to complete the review as quickly as possible to minimize effects on DOE programs. GAO determined that the delay was not reportable under the Impoundment Control Act. The Impoundment Control Act requires the President to notify Congress if an agency wants to withhold the obligation of funds. GAO has separately informed Congress of an impoundment of $91 million in funds that were not allocated to any financial assistance awards, and was not related to DOE's review process. According to the 10 ARPA-E project selectees GAO interviewed, DOE's financial assistance review process created uncertainty, which led to a variety of project impacts. The impacts most commonly cited by selectees included potentially delayed project timelines, as well as difficulties in staffing their project teams, among other impacts as shown below. DOE officials GAO interviewed said that they are reviewing DOE financial assistance in fiscal year 2018. DOE officials said that a key benefit of the fiscal year 2017 review process was an opportunity to better identify and coordinate future financial assistance department-wide on crosscutting issues. However, DOE plans to review fiscal year 2018 financial assistance prior to issuing funding opportunity announcements to the public, and thus before any recipients apply or are selected.

{"input": "", "context": "According to State, the OAS is the primary inter-American political forum through which the United States engages with other countries in the Western Hemisphere to promote democracy, human rights, security, and development. While PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH are independent organizations, the Charter of the Organization of American States directs them to take into account the recommendations of the OAS General Assembly and Councils. PAHO, a specialized international health agency for the Americas, works with member countries throughout the region to improve and protect people’s health and serves as the Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization, the United Nations agency on health. IICA, among other things, supports its member states’ efforts to achieve agricultural development and rural well-being through consultation and the administration of agricultural projects through agreements with the OAS and other entities. PAIGH specializes in regional cartography, geography, history, and geophysics and has facilitated the settlement of regional border disputes. Member states collectively finance these organizations by providing assessed contributions in accordance with the organizations’ regulations. The member states’ assessed contributions are intended to finance the organizations’ regular budgets, which generally cover the organizations’ day-to-day operating expenses, such as facilities and salaries. The budgets are based on each organization’s total approved quota assessment and other projected income. Member states of each organization meet to review and approve the organizations’ budgets. The exact dollar amount each member state is responsible for providing corresponds to its assessed percentage of the total approved quota assessment for any given year. In October 2013, the United States enacted the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Reform Act). The Reform Act directed the Secretary of State to, among other things, submit “a multiyear strategy that…identifies a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that would lead to an assessed fee structure in which no member state would pay more than 50 percent of the OAS’s assessed yearly fees.” According to the Reform Act, it is the sense of Congress that, among other things, it is in the interest of the United States, OAS member states, and a modernized OAS that the OAS move toward an assessed quota structure that (1) assures the financial sustainability of the organization and (2) establishes, by October 2018, that no member state pays more than 50 percent of the organization’s assessed fees. In June 2017, we reported that the United States’ assessed contributions constituted over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to four inter-American organizations from 2014 through 2016 (see table 1). During this time, the annual U.S. percentages (or quotas) of these organizations’ assessed contributions have remained about the same. Therefore, the actual amounts assessed to the United States generally remained the same. All four organizations apply a similar assessed quota structure that uses the relative size of member states’ economies, among other things, to help determine each member state’s assessed contributions. The OAS determines the assessed quota for each member state based on the United Nations’ methodology, as adapted for the OAS, using criteria that include gross national income, debt burden, and per capita income. The other three organizations use OAS’s system for determining member states’ quotas to calculate their member states’ assessed contributions. Thus, any change in the OAS’s assessed quota structure should be reflected at PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH, according to their respective processes regarding the determination of assessed contributions. The U.S. share of assessed contributions may be reduced in the future. The Reform Act required State to submit a strategy identifying, among other things, a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms to the OAS’s assessed quota structure that would lead to a structure in which no member state would pay more than 50 percent of OAS assessed contributions. In response to that requirement, State told us that they submitted to Congress a strategy that included working with OAS member states toward ensuring that the OAS would not assess any single member state a quota of more than 50 percent of all OAS assessed contributions. State officials informed us that they worked with other OAS member states, including Canada and Mexico, to explore assessed quota reform options. For example, State officials consulted with their counterparts from Mexico to review the OAS’s assessed quota structure and to consult on alternatives that would adjust all member states’ quotas so that no member state’s quota exceeds 50 percent of the OAS’s assessed contributions. Subsequent to our June 2017 report, at the OAS General Assembly in June 2017, OAS member states voted to draft a proposal to modify the quota structure to potentially reduce the maximum assessed quota to below 50 percent. According to State officials, the modification to the quota structure, if approved, would be gradual and would not be implemented until 2019. State, HHS, USAID, and USDA fund activities at OAS, PAHO, and IICA in the form of assistance agreements. In our December 2017 report, we reviewed 12 such agreements across the four agencies and found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. State has taken corrective action since the grants were awarded. We also found that all four agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements we reviewed. State and HHS both initiated corrective action prior to our review of the grants. The United States provided voluntary contributions to OAS, PAHO, and IICA through project-specific assistance agreements, such as grants and cooperative agreements. According to U.S. agency officials, the organizations’ regional knowledge and technical expertise make them effective implementing partners for projects serving U.S. national interests and priorities throughout the hemisphere. From calendar years 2014 through 2016, the United States provided voluntary contributions totaling about $105 million to the OAS, PAHO, and IICA, as shown in table 2. In 2016, for example, the United States contributed $32 million, or approximately 22 percent of the total of $143 million from all member states. According to U.S. officials, levels of U.S. voluntary contributions vary year-to-year due to factors that include the schedule of multiyear agreement disbursements, sudden crises, and member states’ priorities. For example, in 2016, USAID approved an assistance agreement for $2 million to OAS to support international observation of government elections in Haiti. In our review of 12 selected assistance agreements from State, HHS, USAID, and USDA (out of a total of 60 active agreements during calendar years 2014 through 2016), we found that none of the agencies had both consistently included all the key monitoring provisions for their agreements and fully documented the monitoring activities required by those provisions. For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities, and USAID did not have full documentation of 2 of its 11 required monitoring activities (financial and performance reports). U.S. agencies could have greater assurance that the organizations are using these funds as intended if they enhanced their monitoring of their assistance agreements. Each of the four agencies has established applicable guidance that calls for agencies to conduct monitoring activities as part of their oversight of their assistance agreements. The agencies implement their guidance by including key provisions to carry out required monitoring activities as part of their agreements. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies to include in agreements all key provisions delineating the parties’ responsibilities. For the 12 agreements we reviewed, the number of key monitoring provisions per agreement varied depending on when the agency issued and updated its guidance relative to when the agreements were approved. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies to document internal controls, transactions, and significant events. Specifically, internal control standards state that agency management should include internal control activities (e.g., monitoring activities) in policies or directives for transactions such as assistance agreements. For the 12 assistance agreements we reviewed, USDA and State did not include provisions implementing 6 of the 55 total (11 percent) monitoring activities required by applicable guidance (see table 3). For example, State did not include two of the key monitoring provisions (a risk assessment and a monitoring plan) in one of its agreements. State took corrective action in 2015 by issuing a standard operating procedure. The agencies specify the requirements to fulfill the key monitoring provisions in the individual assistance agreements, such as by requiring financial reports on a quarterly basis or including specific information in performance reports. Grants officers, if they deem it necessary or appropriate, include additional monitoring provisions requiring activities beyond those required by the applicable guidance, such as site visits. Federal standards for internal control call for agency management to design monitoring activities, such as financial and performance reporting, so that all transactions are completely and accurately recorded. Recording these activities maintains their relevance and value to management in controlling operations and making decisions. Without access to complete monitoring documentation, the agencies risk weakening the effectiveness of these controls. None of the four U.S. agencies had full documentation of all of the monitoring activities required by their agreements we reviewed (see table 4). The agencies did not have full documentation of monitoring activities for 9 of the 12 agreements we reviewed. For the 42 monitoring activities identified across all of the individual agreements, the four agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the activities (43 percent). However, State took corrective action in May 2017 to address its gaps in documentation, and according to HHS officials, the Food and Drug Administration addressed its gap in documentation by implementing its agreement monitoring program in fiscal year 2018. In our December 2017 report, we found that the strategic goals of the four inter-American organizations are predominantly aligned with the high- level strategic goals for the Western Hemisphere documented by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA, as shown in table 5. For example, four of the five goals in State and USAID’s Joint Strategy correspond with goals at the OAS, IICA, and PAIGH. According to officials, the agencies all consider U.S. strategic goals when deciding which projects to fund at OAS, PAHO, and IICA. U.S. agencies, on an ongoing basis, evaluate each inter-American organization to ensure U.S. and organization goals are aligned. For example, according to USAID officials, USAID’s assistance project design and approval policies and procedures ensure that all USAID-funded activities are linked to applicable U.S. and USAID strategies. In conclusion, monitoring the implementation of U.S. assistance agreements and fully documenting the results of such monitoring are key management controls to help ensure that U.S. agreement recipients use federal funds appropriately and effectively. The agencies risk weakening the effectiveness of these controls by not including in their assistance agreements all the key monitoring provisions called for by applicable agency guidance. Further, if the agencies do not have full documentation of the agreements’ required monitoring activities, they may not be able to effectively manage federally funded projects that support U.S. strategic goals. In addition, agencies may not have all the information they need to make budgetary and programmatic decisions. In our December 2017 report, we recommended that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities. The agencies concurred with these recommendations and indicated that they will take actions to address them. For example, USAID said it would issue an agency notice to remind all agreement officers to maintain complete files for each agreement.

The United States helps finance these organizations' operating expenses through assessed contributions. The United States also provides voluntary contributions through the federal funding of assistance agreements to OAS, PAHO, and IICA. This testimony is based on GAO's June and December 2017 reports that, among other things, (1) determined the amounts and percentages of U.S. assessed contributions to the four organizations, (2) assessed the extent to which U.S. agencies included and documented key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements, and (3) assessed the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, HHS, USAID, USDA, and the four organizations. GAO analyzed the four organizations' audited financial reports and a nongeneralizable sample of 12 assistance agreements awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA active in calendar years 2014 through 2016. While the United States' assessed contributions constituted over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to four inter-American organizations from 2014 to 2016, the U.S. share may be reduced in the near future (see table). In response to a statutory requirement, the U.S. Department of State (State) said it submitted to Congress a strategy that included working with the Organization of American States (OAS) member states toward ensuring that the OAS would not assess any single member state a contribution amounting to more than 50 percent of all OAS assessed contributions. At the OAS General Assembly in June 2017, OAS member states voted to draft a proposal to modify its system for determining member states' assessed contributions to potentially reduce the maximum assessed contribution to below 50 percent. The other three organizations use OAS's system for setting assessed contributions. Hence, any change in contributions at OAS should also be reflected at Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH). State, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide voluntary contributions to OAS, PAHO, and IICA in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements). In December 2017, GAO reported that its review of 12 such agreements across the four agencies found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. State has since taken corrective action. GAO also found that all four U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed. For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities, and USAID did not have full documentation of 2 of its 11 required activities. State and HHS said they initiated corrective action before our review. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. GAO found that the strategic goals of the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of State, USAID, HHS, and USDA. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that assistance agreements with these organizations align with U.S. goals. In its December 2017 report, GAO recommended that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities.

{"input": "", "context": "Congress appropriates foreign affairs funding primarily through annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations. Prior to FY2008, however, Congress provided funds for the Department of State and international broadcasting within the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations (CJS) and separately provided foreign aid funds within Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs appropriations. The transition between the different alignments occurred in the 109 th Congress, with a change in appropriations subcommittee jurisdiction. For that Congress, the House of Representatives appropriated State Department funds separately from foreign aid, as in earlier Congresses, but the Senate differed by appropriating State and foreign aid funds within one bill—the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations. Both the House and Senate began jointly funding Department of State and foreign aid appropriations within the Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ). SFOPS appropriations currently include State Department Operations (including accounts for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance, and Education and Cultural Affairs, among others); Foreign Operations (including USAID administration expenses, bilateral economic assistance, international security assistance, multilateral assistance, and export assistance); various international commissions; and International Broadcasting (including VOA, RFE/RL, Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks). While the distribution varies slightly from year to year, Foreign Operations funding is typically about twice as much as State Operations funding. In addition to regular, enduring SFOPS appropriations, Congress has approved emergency supplemental funding requested by Administrations to address emergency or otherwise off-cycle budget needs. Since FY2012, Congress has also appropriated Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding requested within the regular budget process for Department of State and USAID war-related expenses. This report lists the legislative and funding history of SFOPS appropriations and includes funding trends. Nearly all foreign affairs appropriations within the past 25 years were passed within omnibus, consolidated, or full-year continuing resolutions, rather than in stand-alone bills, and usually after the start of the new fiscal year. Many foreign policy experts contend that stand-alone appropriations legislation would allow for a more rigorous debate on specific foreign policy activities and improve the ability to introduce or fund new programs, or cancel and defund existing programs. Such experts assert that the frequent practice of passing continuing resolutions and delaying passage of appropriations well into the next fiscal year has hindered program planning (not just in foreign affairs) and has reduced the ability to fund programs that did not exist in the previous cycle. In addition to annual appropriations, several laws require Congress to authorize State and foreign operations funding prior to expenditure. Before 2003, Congress typically provided authorization in a biannual Foreign Relations Authorization bill. This practice not only authorized funding for obligation and expenditure, but also provided a forum for more rigorous debate on specific foreign affairs and foreign aid policies and a legislative vehicle for congressional direction. In recent years, the House and Senate have separately introduced or considered foreign relations and foreign aid authorization bills, but none have been enacted. Table 1 below provides a 25-year history of enacted foreign affairs appropriations laws (excluding short-term continuing resolutions and supplemental appropriations), including the dates they were sent to the President and signed into law. Some observations follow: Since FY1995, Congress appropriated foreign affairs funding in on-time, freestanding bills once—in 1994 for the FY1995 appropriations year. The last time Congress passed foreign affairs funding on time, but not in freestanding legislation, was for FY1997. Congress included foreign affairs funding within an omnibus, consolidated, or full-year continuing resolution 21 of the past 25 years. FY2006 was the last time Congress enacted freestanding State Department and foreign operations appropriations bills. Six times over the past 25 years, Congress sent the State and foreign operations appropriations to the President in March, April, or May—six to eight months into the fiscal year. Since realignment of the foreign affairs appropriations legislation in FY2008, SFOPS appropriations measures have included State Department Operations, Foreign Operations, various international commissions, and International Broadcasting. For a full list of the accounts included in the FY2019 SFOPS, see Table 2 . Table 3 and Figure 1 provide the funding levels for enduring funds and Supplemental/OCO funds in the Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs for FY2001-2020 request (in current dollars). Although current funding for State-Foreign Operations generally has grown since FY2001, there was a spike in funding in FY2004 that can, in large part, be attributed to supplemental funding for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, which provided additional funds in that year. The creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) added to growing funding levels from FY2004-FY2009. OCO became a regular part of foreign affairs funding as of FY2012. Supplemental funding for Ebola in FY2015, Zika in FY2016, and OCO in FY2017 contributed to the rise in funding levels during those years (see Figure 2 ). The constant dollar trend line generally continues to increase, although at a slower pace than current dollars. FY2004 remains the peak year in constant dollars. The introduction of OCO funding in FY2012 briefly elevated SFOPS funding, but in the following years, funding levels off at nearly the same amount as the FY2012 level. After removing inflation, funding for FY2013 through the FY2020 request declines below that level, suggesting that the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) has kept foreign affairs funding below the rate of inflation. The Administration distinguishes between enduring (also called base, regular, or ongoing), emergency supplemental, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. Funds designated as emergency or OCO are not subject to procedural limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions, or the statutory discretionary spending limits provided through the Budget Control Act of 2011 for FY2011-FY2021 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ). Prior to FY2012, the President typically submitted to Congress additional funding requests (after the initial annual budget request), referred to as emergency supplementals. Supplemental funding packages have historically been approved to address emergency, war-related, or otherwise off-cycle budget needs. The Obama Administration requested emergency supplemental appropriations for urgent unexpected expenses, such as the U.S. international responses to Ebola, the Zika virus, and famine relief to Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Northeast Nigeria. The Trump Administration has not requested supplemental funding for unexpected international crises. In contrast to emergency supplemental appropriations, the Obama Administration included within the regular budget request in FY2012 what it described as short-term, temporary, war-related funding for the frontline states of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan—designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds, or OCO. Congress had used the OCO designation in earlier years for Department of Defense appropriations to distinguish between ongoing versus war-related expenditures. In response to the FY2012 SFOPS OCO request, Congress appropriated OCO funds for the Department of State and USAID activities beyond the requested level and for more than just activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. In FY2012, Congress included OCO funds for the three frontline states as well as for Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, and the Philippines. The Obama Administration first requested OCO funds for a country other than the three frontline states in FY2015, when it requested OCO funds for Syria. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested OCO funds for the Department of State and USAID activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as \"High Threat/High Risk\" areas. These included Syria, Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia, and South Sudan, among others. The Administration's initial FY2019 request included OCO funds for the Department of State and USAID, but after passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123 ), the Administration requested that all previously requested SFOPS OCO funds be moved to enduring funds. For FY2020, the Trump Administration again requested no OCO funds for foreign affairs agencies. Since FY2012, OCO has ranged from a low of 14% of the total budget request in FY2014 to a high of 36% in FY2017, when the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015, P.L. 114-74 ) set nonbinding OCO minimums for FY2016 and FY2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123 ) raised discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019 and extended direct spending reductions through FY2027. With the raised spending limits, the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request did not include the OCO designation for any foreign assistance funds. However, Congress has continued to appropriate OCO funds, including $8.0 billion in FY2019. The Administration's FY2020 budget request also does not request OCO funds for State-Foreign Operations appropriations. The BCA and BBAs have had an effect on foreign affairs funding levels and may have future implications. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets limits on discretionary spending through FY2021 for defense and nondefense funding categories. Because OCO funds are not counted against the discretionary spending limits, the BCA has put downward pressure on SFOPS enduring/base funds, while OCO has increasingly funded other foreign affairs activities. In addition, the 2015 BBA significantly increased FY2016 and FY2017 OCO funding for foreign affairs over the requested funding levels in FY2015 and FY2016, further encouraging a migration of funds for ongoing activities into OCO-designated accounts. However, the 2018 BBA has had the opposite effect on foreign affairs OCO, allowing lawmakers to shift OCO funding back into enduring/base accounts.

In those years, Congress separately appropriated funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and foreign aid within the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs appropriations. The 110th Congress aligned the two foreign affairs appropriations into the SFOPS legislation. SFOPS appropriations since FY2001 have included enduring appropriations (ongoing or base funding), emergency supplemental appropriations, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) appropriations. Total SFOPS funding levels in both current and constant dollars show a general upward trend, with FY2004 as the peak largely as a result of emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Funds. When adjusted for inflation, annual foreign affairs appropriations have yet to surpass the FY2004 peak. The Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Acts (BBA) of 2015 and 2018 appear to have had an impact on both enduring and OCO funding levels. The legislative history of SFOPS appropriations shows that nearly all foreign affairs appropriations measures within the past 25 years were passed within omnibus, consolidated, or full-year continuing resolutions, rather than in stand-alone bills.

{"input": "", "context": "Cluster munitions are weapons that open in mid-air and disperse smaller submunitions—anywhere from a few dozen to hundreds—into an area. They can be delivered by aircraft or from ground systems such as artillery, rockets, and missiles. Cluster munitions are valued militarily because one munition can kill or destroy many targets within its impact area, and fewer weapons systems are needed to deliver fewer munitions to attack multiple targets. Cluster munitions also permit a smaller force to engage a larger adversary and are considered by some an \"economy of force\" weapon. Many cluster munitions rely on simple mechanical fuzes that arm the submunition based on its rate of spin and explode on impact or after a time delay. A newer generation of sensor-fuzed submunitions is being introduced by a number of nations to improve the munitions' and submunitions' accuracy and to reduce the large number of residual unexploded submunitions. These sensor-fuzed submunitions are designed to sense and destroy vehicles without creating an extensive hazard area of unexploded submunitions. Cluster bombs were first used in World War II, and inclusive of their debut, cluster munitions have been used in at least 21 states by at least 13 different countries. Cluster munitions were used extensively in Southeast Asia by the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) estimates that in Laos alone, 9 million to 27 million unexploded submunitions remained after the conflict, resulting in over 10,000 civilian casualties to date. Cluster munitions were used by the Soviets in Afghanistan, by the British in the Falklands, by the Coalition in the Gulf War, and by the warring factions in Yugoslavia. In Kosovo and Yugoslavia in 1999, NATO forces dropped 1,765 cluster bombs containing approximately 295,000 submunitions. From 2001 through 2002, the United States dropped 1,228 cluster bombs containing 248,056 submunitions in Afghanistan, and U.S. and British forces used almost 13,000 cluster munitions containing an estimated 1.8 million to 2 million submunitions during the first three weeks of combat in Iraq in 2003. Senior U.S. government officials have stated that the United States has not used cluster munitions since 2003, during the intervention in Iraq. It is widely believed that confusion over U.S. cluster submunitions (BLU-97/B) that were the same color and size as air-dropped humanitarian food packets played a major role in the U.S. decision to suspend cluster munitions use in Afghanistan but not before using them in Iraq. In 2006, Israeli use of cluster munitions against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon resulted in widespread international criticism. Israel was said to have fired significant quantities of cluster munitions—primarily during the last 3 days of the 34-day war after a U.N. cease-fire deal had been agreed to —resulting in almost 1 million unexploded cluster bomblets to which the U.N. attributed 14 deaths during the conflict. Reports maintain that Hezbollah fired about 113 \"cluster rockets\" at northern Israel and, in turn, Israel's use of cluster munitions supposedly affected 26% of southern Lebanon's arable land and contaminated about 13 square miles with unexploded submunitions. One report states that there was a failure rate of upward of 70% of Israel's cluster weapons. The fundamental criticisms of cluster munitions are that they disperse large numbers of submunitions imprecisely over an extended area, that they frequently fail to detonate and are difficult to detect, and that submunitions can remain explosive hazards for decades. Civilian casualties are primarily caused by munitions being fired into areas where soldiers and civilians are intermixed, inaccurate cluster munitions landing in populated areas, or civilians traversing areas where cluster munitions have been employed but failed to explode. Two technical characteristics of submunitions—failure rate and lack of a self-destruct capability—have received a great deal of attention. There appear to be significant discrepancies among failure rate estimates. Some manufacturers claim a submunition failure rate of 2% to 5%, whereas mine clearance specialists have frequently reported failure rates of 10% to 30%. A number of factors influence submunition reliability. These include delivery technique, age of the submunition, air temperature, landing in soft or muddy ground, getting caught in trees and vegetation, and submunitions being damaged after dispersal, or landing in such a manner that their impact fuzes fail to initiate. Submunitions lacking a self-destruct capability—referred to as \"dumb\" munitions—are of particular concern because they can remain a hazard for decades, thereby increasing the potential for civilian casualties. Some nations are developing \"smart\" or sensor-fuzed weapons with greater reliability and a variety of self-destruct mechanisms intended to address the residual hazard of submunitions. Experts maintain that self-destruct features reduce—but do not eliminate—the unexploded ordnance problem caused by cluster munitions and that the advantage gained by using \"smart\" cluster munitions is negated when high-failure rate and/or \"dumb\" cluster munitions are used in the same area. For some nations, replacing \"dumb\" and high-failure rate cluster munitions may not be an option—China, Russia, and the Republic of Korea maintain that they cannot afford to replace all current submunitions with \"smart\" submunitions. In an effort to restrict or ban specific types of weapons used in armed conflicts, 51 states negotiated the CCW in 1980. When the treaty entered into force in December 1983, it applied only to incendiary weapons, mines and booby-traps, and weapons intended to cause casualties through very small fragments. Since then, some states-parties have added provisions through additional protocols to address other types of weapons. Acting in accordance with the recommendation of a group of experts established during the 2006 CCW review conference, states-parties to the convention decided in 2007 to \"negotiate a proposal to address urgently the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions.\" Negotiations took place in 2008 and 2009, but the parties have not reached agreement on a new proposal. The experts group continued negotiations in 2011 \"informed by\" a Draft Protocol on Cluster Munitions. However, the CCW states-parties were unable to reach agreement on a protocol during their November 2011 review conference. Described as \"frustrated with the CCW process,\" a number of CCW members—led by Norway—initiated negotiations in 2007 outside of the CCW to ban cluster munitions. On May 30, 2008, they reached an agreement to ban cluster munitions. The United States, Russia, China, Israel, Egypt, India, and Pakistan did not participate in the talks or sign the agreement. During the Signing Conference in Oslo on December 3-4, 2008, 94 states signed the convention and 4 of the signatories ratified the convention at the same time. China, Russia, and the United States did not sign the convention, but France, Germany, and the United Kingdom were among the 18 NATO members to do so. The convention was to enter into force six months after the deposit of the 30 th ratification. The United Nations received the 30 th ratification on February 16, 2010, and the convention entered into force on August 1, 2010. As of January 2, 2019, 105 states were party to the convention. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), inter alia, bans the use of cluster munitions, as well as their development, production, acquisition, transfer, and stockpiling. The convention does not prohibit cluster munitions that can detect and engage a single target or explosive submunitions equipped with an electronic self-destruction or self-deactivating feature —an exemption that seemingly permits sensor-fuzed or \"smart\" cluster submunitions. U.S. officials were concerned that early versions of the CCM would prevent military forces from non-states-parties from providing humanitarian and peacekeeping support and significantly affect NATO military operations, but the version signed May 30, 2008, does permit states-parties to engage in military cooperation and operations with non-states-parties (Article 21, Paragraph 3). Then-Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen Mull stated in May 2008 that the United States relies on cluster munitions \"as an important part of our own defense strategy,\" and that Washington's preferred alternative to a ban is \"to pursue technological fixes that will make sure that these weapons are no longer viable once the conflict is over.\" U.S. officials note that Cluster munitions are available for use by every combat aircraft in the U.S. inventory, they are integral to every Army or Marine maneuver element and in some cases constitute up to 50 percent of tactical indirect fire support. U.S. forces simply can not fight by design or by doctrine without holding out at least the possibility of using cluster munitions. The United States also maintains that using cluster munitions reduces the number of aircraft and artillery systems needed to support military operations, and that if cluster munitions were eliminated, significantly more money would need to be spent on new weapons systems, ammunition, and logistical resources. Officials further suggest that if cluster munitions were eliminated, most militaries would increase their use of massed artillery and rocket barrages, which would likely increase destruction of key infrastructure. Then-Department of State Legal Adviser Harold Koh stated November 9, 2009, that the United States has determined that its \"national security interests cannot be fully ensured consistent with the terms\" of the CCM. The Barack Obama Administration announced on November 25, 2011, that the United States would continue to implement the DOD policy on cluster munitions issued June 19, 2008, which recognized the need to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure but also reaffirmed that \"cluster munitions are legitimate weapons with clear military utility.\" The central directive in the Pentagon's policy was the unwaiverable requirement that cluster munitions used after 2018 must leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield. Prior to that deadline, U.S. use of cluster munitions that did not meet this criterion required combatant commander approval. On November 30, 2017, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan issued a revised policy on cluster munitions. The memorandum describing the policy noted that [c]luster munitions provide the Joint Force with an effective and necessary capability to engage area targets, including massed formations of enemy forces, individual targets dispersed over a defined area, targets whose precise location are not known, and time-sensitive or moving targets. Cluster munitions are legitimate weapons with clear military utility, as they provide distinct advantages against a range of threats in the operating environment. Additionally, the use of cluster munitions may result in less collateral damage than the collateral damage that results from use of unitary munitions alone. Since the inception of the 2008 policy, in the midst of extended combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have witnessed important changes in the global security environment and experienced several years of budgets that under-invested in replacement systems and the modernization of the Joint Force more broadly. Our adversaries and our potential adversaries have developed advanced capabilities and operational approaches specifically designed to limit our ability to project power. Both Shanahan and Admiral Harry Harris Jr. have also argued that sustaining the current U.S. cluster munitions arsenal is necessary to prepare for a potential conflict with North Korea. The revised policy reverses the 2008 policy that established an unwaiverable requirement that cluster munitions used after 2018 must leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield. Combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. Furthermore, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate, and these munitions will be removed only after new munitions that meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard are fielded in sufficient quantities to meet combatant commander requirements. However, the new DOD policy stipulates that the department \"will only procure cluster munitions containing submunitions or submunition warheads\" meeting the 2008 UXO requirement or possessing \"advanced features to minimize the risks posed by unexploded submunitions.\" Specifically, DOD's revised policy stipulates the following: Continuing or beginning with their respective FY2019 budgets, the military departments will program for capabilities to replace cluster munitions currently in active inventories that do not meet the above-described standards for procuring new cluster munitions. The department's annual Program and Budget Review will be used to assess the sufficiency of the replacement efforts. The department's operational planners should plan for the availability of cluster munitions. The approval authority to employ cluster munitions that do not meet the standards prescribed by this policy for procuring new cluster munitions, however, rests with the combatant commanders. In accordance with their existing authorities, commanders may use cluster munitions that meet the standards prescribed by this policy for procuring new cluster munitions. The military departments and combatant commands, in keeping with U.S. legal obligations under CCW Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War and consistent with past practices, will continue to record and retain information on the use of cluster munitions and provide relevant information to facilitate the removal or destruction of unexploded submunitions. The military departments and combatant commands will maintain sufficient inventories and a robust stockpile surveillance program to ensure operational quality and reliability of cluster munitions. In extremis, to meet immediate warfighting demand, combatant commanders may accept transfers of cluster munitions that do not meet the above-described cluster-munition procurement standards. Cluster munitions that do not meet the standards prescribed by this policy for procuring new cluster munitions will be removed from active inventories and demilitarized after their capabilities have been replaced by sufficient quantities of munitions that meet the standards in this policy. The department will not transfer cluster munitions except as provided for under U.S. law. The operational use of cluster munitions that include Anti-Personnel Landmines (APL) submunitions shall comply with presidential policy. Furthermore, the Deputy Secretary of Defense Expect(s) the Department to achieve the goals in this policy as rapidly as industry can support. Combatant Commanders will continue to ensure that the employment of cluster munitions is consistent with the law of war and applicable international agreements in order to minimize their harmful effects on civilian populations and infrastructure. In developing a new generation of cluster munitions less dangerous to civilians, DOD will need to determine whether such a high level of performance is achievable under both controlled laboratory conditions and real-world conditions. Factors such as delivery technique, landing in soft or muddy ground, getting caught in trees and vegetation, and submunitions being damaged after dispersal or landing could result in an appreciable number of dud submunitions, even if they have a self-deactivation feature. DOD and the services have been and are currently involved in efforts to reduce cluster munitions failure rates. The Army's Alternative Warhead Program (AWP) is intended to assess and recommend new technologies to reduce or eliminate cluster munitions failure rates. The AWP program is viewed as particularly relevant, as the Pentagon estimates that \"upward of 80 percent of U.S. cluster munitions reside in the Army artillery stockpile.\" In December 2008, the Army decided to cease procurement of a Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) warhead—the Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) warhead—because its submunitions had a dud rate up to 5%. The Air Force has also acquired cluster munitions that comply with the less than 1% failure rate—the CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) and the CBU-105 WCMD/SFW. While DOD's new 2017 cluster munitions policy calls for DOD to continue its efforts to meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard \"as rapidly as industry can support,\" it is not yet known how this policy will affect the aforementioned programs or how it could result in the establishment of new programs. It may be argued that even with advances in \"sensor-fuzed\" type submunitions that seek out and destroy certain targets, cluster munitions are still essentially an indiscriminate area weapon in an era where precision weapons are increasingly becoming the military norm. In Operation Desert Storm in 1991, only about 10% of ordnance used were precision-guided, but by the time of the Iraq invasion in 2003, \"the ratio of 'smart' to dumb weapons was nearly reversed.\" Since then, this trend toward greater precision has continued, if not accelerated with the development of precision rocket, artillery, mortar munitions, and smaller precision aerial bombs designed to reduce collateral damage. Given current and predicted future precision weaponry trends, cluster munitions might be losing their military relevance—much as chemical weapons did between World War I and World War II. According to the State Department, the U.S. military suspended its use of cluster munitions in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003. For subsequent military operations, where cluster munitions would otherwise have been the weapon of choice, Congress might review what types of weapons were substituted in place of cluster munitions and how effective they were in achieving the desired tactical results. Also worth considering are effects-based weapons systems and operations, which seek to achieve the same or similar effect against a potential target without applying a \"kinetic solution\" such as a cluster munition. Such insights could prove valuable in analyzing U.S. policy options on the future of cluster munitions. DOD's November 2017 revised policy on cluster munitions potentially raises a number of issues for possible congressional consideration. With limits on cluster munition use after 2018 rescinded, how does this affect combatant commanders' operational plans in their respective theaters? Does this mean a lesser degree of military risk because combatant commanders can employ cluster munitions to meet warfighting demands, possibly translating into fewer forces needed to achieve the same result when the 2008 policy was in effect? Despite DOD emphasis on achieving a 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard \"as rapidly as industry can support,\" will DOD funding restrictions slow or stall programs previously intended to replace those systems that exceeded 1% because there no longer is an urgent operational need to replace those systems? In a similar manner, will defense industry view this as a renewed opportunity to develop systems with a 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard or take a more sanguine view that since DOD is no longer time constrained to develop and field 1% or less weapons that funding these programs will be less of a priority and, therefore, an unprofitable venture? Another possible issue for consideration is how this U.S. policy reversal on the military use of cluster munitions will be perceived by the international community and how this might affect future U.S. and international military treaty initiatives. Consolidated Appropriations Acts The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ), which the President signed into law December 16, 2009, prohibits the provision of military assistance for cluster munitions, the issuing of defense export licenses for cluster munitions, or the sale or transfer of cluster munitions or cluster munitions technology unless \"the submunitions of the cluster munitions, after arming, do not result in more than 1 percent unexploded ordnance across the range of intended operational environments.\" Moreover, any agreement \"applicable to the assistance, transfer, or sale of such cluster munitions or cluster munitions technology\" must specify that the munitions \"will only be used against clearly defined military targets and will not be used where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians.\" Subsequent appropriations laws have included similar provisions; the most recent is the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), which the President signed into law on February 15, 2019. ", "answers": ["Cluster munitions are air-dropped or ground-launched weapons that release a number of smaller submunitions intended to kill enemy personnel or destroy vehicles. Cluster munitions were developed in World War II and are part of many nations' weapons stockpiles. Cluster munitions have been used frequently in combat, including the early phases of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to view cluster munitions as a military necessity but in 2008 instituted a policy to reduce the failure rate of cluster munitions to 1% or less after 2018. In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "length": 3397, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5ceebd22b8088b51e107158a0abee9f03eef1fff3a8fbd90"}
{"input": "", "context": "Federal law houses hundreds of offenses punishable by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. Although only a handful of these mandatory minimum offenses are prosecuted with any regularity, drug trafficking offenses accounted for over two-thirds of the total. Congress has created three procedures that make punishment for these offenses a little less mandatory. One, the so-called safety valve (18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)), permits a sentencing court to disregard a statutory minimum sentence for the benefit of a low-level, nonviolent, cooperative defendant with a minimal prior criminal record, convicted under several mandatory minimum controlled substance offenses. The other two, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) and Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, afford a sentencing court comparable latitude but only on the motion of the prosecutor, based on the defendant's substantial assistance to the government, and without regard to the offense charged. In October 2009, Congress instructed the U.S. Sentencing Commission to prepare a report on the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions under federal law. In early 2010, the commission conducted a survey of federal district court judges regarding their views on mandatory minimum sentencing. A majority of those responding endorsed amendments to the safety valve and substantial assistance exceptions. The commission also held a public hearing at which several witnesses urged adjustments in the safety valve and substantial assistance provisions. The commission subsequently recommended that Congress consider expanding the safety valve to cover other offenses and to reach offenders with a slightly more extensive prior criminal record. The First Step Act authorized safety-valve relief for convictions under the Maritime Drug Enforcement Act and for defendants with slightly more extensive prior criminal records. Low-level drug offenders can escape some of the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum sentences if they qualify for the safety valve. Congress created the safety valve after it became concerned that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions could have resulted in equally severe penalties for both the more and the less culpable offenders. It is available to qualified offenders convicted of violations of the drug trafficking, simple possession, attempt, or conspiracy provisions of the Controlled Substances or Controlled Substances Import and Export acts. It is not available to avoid the mandatory minimum sentences that attend some of the other controlled substance offenses, even those closely related to the covered offenses. For instance, not covered are convictions under the statute that proscribes drug trafficking near schools, playgrounds, or public housing facilities and that sets the penalties for violation at twice those set for simple drug trafficking. In addition, until the First Step Act, safety valve relief was not available to those convicted under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA), even though the MDLEA proscribes conduct closely related to the smuggling and trafficking activities outlawed in the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. The prosecution need not prove that a defendant is ineligible for safety valve relief. The Supreme Court did hold in Alleyne v. United States \"that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an 'element' [of the offense] that must be submitted to the jury\" and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Subsequent lower appellate courts, however, have held that Alleyne does not require a jury verdict or application of the reasonable doubt standard. Thus, for the convictions to which the safety valve applies, the defendant must convince the sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence that he satisfies each of the safety valve's five requirements. He may not have a disqualifying criminal history point total. He may not have used violence or a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. He may not have been an organizer or leader of the drug enterprise. He must have provided the government with all the information and evidence at his disposal. Finally, the offense may not have resulted in serious injury or death. [T]he defendant does not have – (A) more than 4 criminal history points, excluding any criminal history points resulting from a 1-point offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines; (B) a prior 3-point offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines; and (C) a prior 2-point violent offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1). The criminal history point disqualification refers to the defendant's prior criminal record. The Sentencing Guidelines assign criminal history points based on a defendant's past criminal record. Prior sentences of imprisonment or juvenile detention of less than 60 days are assigned a single criminal history point . Prior sentences of imprisonment or juvenile detention of from 60 days up to a year and a month are assigned two criminal history points ; as are sentences imposed for offenses committed while the defendant was in prison, was an escaped prisoner, or was on probation, parole, or supervised release. Prior sentences of imprisonment for a year and a month or more are assigned three criminal history points . A number of convictions do not count, including the following: Stale convictions 15-year-old, three-point convictions, 10-year-old, one- or two-point convictions, or 5-year-old, one- or two-point juvenile adjudications; Summary court-martial convictions; Foreign convictions; Tribal convictions; Expunged, reversed, vacated, or invalidated convictions; and Certain petty offenses or minor misdemeanors: Hunting and fishing violations, juvenile truancy, and the like, regardless of the sentence imposed. Gambling, prostitution, and the like if the offender was sentenced no more severely than to imprisonment for 30 days or less or to probation for less than a year. Similar offenses to those listed \"by whatever name they are known.\" [T]he defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense, 18 U.SC. 3553(f)(2). [T]he offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(3). The safety valve has two disqualifications designed to reserve its benefits to the nonviolent. The weapon or threat-of-violence disqualification turns upon the defendant's conduct or the conduct of those he \"aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.\" It is not triggered by the conduct of a co-conspirator, unless the defendant aided, abetted, or counselled the co-conspirator's violence or possession. Disqualifying firearm possession may be either actual or constructive. Constructive possession is the dominion or control over a firearm or the place where one is located. Disqualification requires the threat of violence or possession of a firearm \"in connection with the offense,\" sometimes characterized as \"active possession.\" In many instances, possession of a firearm in a location where drugs are stored or transported, or where transactions occur, will be enough to support an inference of possession in connection with the drug offense of conviction. \"[E]ven a single intimidating confrontation [is] enough to constitute a credible threat\" and is consequently safety valve disqualifying. Conversely, a sentencing enhancement for a co-conspirator's possession does not automatically preclude qualification. The Sentencing Guidelines define \"serious bodily injury\" for purposes of Section 3553(f)(3) as an \"injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.\" On its face, the definition would include serious bodily injuries, such as hospitalization, suffered by the defendant as a result of the offense. Moreover, a defendant is more likely to be disqualified under Section 3553(f)(3) if a fellow conspirator seriously injures a victim than would be the case under Section 3553(f)(2) if the conspirator merely carries a firearm. [T]he defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in Section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(4)(emphasis added). The defendant must also establish that he or she was not \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense.\" The term supervisor is construed broadly and encompasses anyone who exercises control or authority of another during the commission of the offense. The Sentencing Guidelines disqualify anyone who receives a guideline level increase for their aggravated role in the offense. Thus, by implication, it does not require a defendant to have received a guideline increase based on his minimal or minor participation in a group offense, nor does it disqualify a defendant who acted alone. [N]ot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(5). At one time the most heavily contested safety valve prerequisite, Section 3553(f)(5) requires full disclosure on the part of the defendant. As in the case of the other prerequisites, the defendant here bears the burden of establishing his qualification for safety valve relief. The requirement extends not only to information concerning the crime of conviction, but also to information concerning other crimes that \"were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan,\" including uncharged related conduct. Neither Section 3553(f) nor the Sentencing Guidelines explain what form the defendants' full disclosure must take. At least one court has held that under rare circumstances disclosure through the defendant's testimony at trial may suffice. Most often the defendant provides the information during an interview with prosecutors or by a proffer. The defendant must disclose the information to the prosecutor, however. Disclosure to the probation officer during preparation of the presentence report is not sufficient. Moreover, a defendant does not necessarily qualify for relief merely because he has proffered a statement and invited the prosecution to identify any additional information it seeks; for \"the government is under no obligation to solicit information from a defendant.\" The defendant must provide the government with all the relevant information in his possession. And, he must do so \"no later than the time of the sentencing hearing.\" Information offered after the sentencing hearing does not qualify, although information offered following appellate remand for resentencing and prior to the resentencing hearing may qualify. On the other hand, past lies do not render a defendant ineligible for relief under the truthful disclosure criterion of the safety valve, although they may undermine his credibility. Three provisions authorize federal courts to reduce a defendant's sentence on the motion of the government for substantial assistance: Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), and Section 5K1.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Only Section 3553(e) and Rule 35(b) authorize sentences below otherwise applicable mandatory minimums. Unlike the safety valve, neither Section 3553(e) nor Rule 35(b) is limited to mandatory minimums established for controlled substance offenses. The substantial assistance provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), passed with little fanfare in the twilight of the 99 th Congress as part of the massive Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, legislation that established or increased a number of mandatory minimum sentencing provisions. The section continues in its original form virtually unchanged: (e) Limited Authority To Impose a Sentence Below a Statutory Minimum. - Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall be imposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code. The section passed between the date authorizing creation of the Sentencing Guidelines and the date they became effective. Rather than replicate the language of Section 3553(e), the guidelines contain an overlapping section that authorizes a sentencing court to depart from the minimum sentence called for by the guidelines. As a general rule, a defendant is entitled to a sentence below an otherwise applicable statutory minimum under the provisions of Section 3553(e) only if the government and the court agree. The courts have acknowledged that due process or equal protection or other constitutional guarantees may provide a narrow exception. \"Thus, a defendant would be entitled to relief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because of the defendant's race or religion.\" A defendant is entitled to relief if the government's refusal constitutes a breach of its plea agreement. A defendant is also \"entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end.\" Some courts have suggested that a defendant is entitled to relief if the prosecution refuses to move under circumstances that \"shock the conscience of the court,\" or that demonstrate bad faith, or for reasons unrelated to substantial assistance. A majority of the judges who answered the Sentencing Commission's survey agreed that relief under Section 3553(e) should be available even in the absence of motion from the prosecutor. Despite their similarities, Section 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. Section 5K1.1 are not the same. A motion under Section 3553(e) authorizes a sentence beneath the mandatory minimum, and a motion under U.S.S.G. Section 5K1.1 authorizes a sentence beneath the applicable Sentencing Guideline range. Thus, a motion under Section 5K1.1 will ordinarily not be construed as a motion under Section 3553(e), in order to permit a court sentence below an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum sentencing requirement. Any sentence imposed below the statutory minimum by virtue of Section 3553(e) must be based on the extent of the defendant's assistance; it may not reflect considerations unrelated to such assistance. It has been suggested, however, that a court may use the Section 5K1.1 factors for that determination, that is, \"(1) the court's evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant's assistance, taking into consideration the government's evaluation of the assistance rendered; (2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant; (3) the nature and extent of the defendant's assistance; (4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance; [and] (5) the timeliness of the defendant's assistance.\" The substantial assistance exception makes possible convictions that might otherwise be unattainable. Yet, it may also lead to \"inverted sentencing,\" that is, a situation in which \"the more serious the defendant's crimes, the lower the sentence—because the greater his wrongs, the more information and assistance he had to offer to a prosecutor\"; while in contrast the exception is of no avail to the peripheral offender who can provide no substantial assistance. Perhaps for this reason, most of the judges who responded to the Sentencing Commission survey agreed that a sentencing court should not be limited to assistance-related factors and should be allowed to use the generally permissible sentencing factors when calculating a sentence under Section 3553(e). In the before-and-after sentencing tale of avoiding a statutory mandatory minimum for substantial assistance, Rule 35(b) is the after. It is available only after sentencing. If the defendant's sentence is vacated on appeal, a Section 3553(e) motion rather than a Rule 35(b) motion is the appropriate vehicle for relief during resentencing. The rule features a two-pronged postsentence authorization for sentence reduction at the behest of the government. First, the government may always file a motion for sentence reduction including reduction below an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum if it does so within a year of sentencing. Second, the government may file a comparable motion a year after sentencing, but only under narrow circumstances that excuse the failure to make a more timely motion. Here, too, a motion by the government is a prerequisite to relief, and the government's decision to refuse to move can be overcome only where the government's silence is unconstitutionally grounded or based on some rationale not reasonably related to a legitimate government end. A district court, faced with a Rule 35(b) motion, must determine whether the defendant in fact rendered substantial assistance and if so what level of reduction, if any, is warranted. As part of its assessment, the court may, but is not required to, consider the general sentencing factors found in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). There is some authority for the proposition that the defendant has no right to notice and hearing following the submission of a Rule 35(b) motion. Moreover, Rule 35(b) does not authorize a court to reduce the amount of restitution previously ordered.", "answers": ["Federal law requires a sentencing judge to impose a minimum sentence of imprisonment following conviction for any of a number of federal offenses. Congress has created three exceptions. Two are available in any case where the prosecutor asserts that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of another. The other, commonly referred to as the safety valve, is available, without the government's approval, for a handful of the more commonly prosecuted drug trafficking and unlawful possession offenses that carry minimum sentences. Qualification for the substantial assistance exceptions is ordinarily only possible upon the motion of the government. In rare cases, the court may compel the government to file such a motion when the defendant can establish that the refusal to do so was based on constitutionally invalid considerations, or was in derogation of a plea bargain obligation or was the product of bad faith. Qualification for the safety valve exception requires a defendant to satisfy five criteria. His past criminal record must be minimal; he must not have been a leader, organizer, or supervisor in the commission of the offense; he must not have used violence in the commission of the offense, and the offense must not have resulted in serious injury; and prior to sentencing, he must tell the government all that he knows of the offense and any related misconduct. In response to a congressional request, the U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended expansion of the safety valve.

The CQ Member Profiles at the beginning of the 116 th Congress indicate the following: 17 Members of the House have no educational degree beyond a high school diploma; 6 Members of the House have associate's degrees as their highest degrees; 99 Members of the House and 18 Senators earned a master's degree as their highest attained degrees; 161 Members of the House (36.6% of the House) and 53 Senators (53% of the Senate) hold law degrees; 21 Representatives and 4 Senators have doctoral (Ph.D., D.Phil., Ed.D., or D. Min) degrees; and 21 Members of the House and 4 Senators have medical degrees. By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), 85% of House Members and 88% of Senators held bachelor's degrees. Approximately 45 years ago, in the 94 th Congress (1975-1976), 82% of House Members and 88% of Senators held bachelor's degrees. About 60 years ago, in the 87 th Congress (1961-1962), 76% of House Members and 76% of Senators held bachelor's degrees. Five Representatives and one Senator are graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, two Representatives and one Senator graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, and one Senator graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy. Five Representatives and one Senator were Rhodes Scholars, two Representatives were Fulbright Scholars, two Representatives were Marshall Scholars, and two Representatives and one Senator were Truman Scholars. The average length of service for Representatives at the beginning of the 116 th Congress was 8.6 years (4.3 House terms); for Senators, 10.1 years (1.7 Senate terms). At the beginning of the 116 th Congress, 90 of the House Members, including the Resident Commissioner for Puerto Rico (20.4% of the total House Membership), had first been elected to the House in November 2018, and 9 of the Senators (9% of the total Senate membership) had first been elected to the Senate in November 2018. These numbers are higher than at the beginning of the 115 th Congress, when 11.8% of the House and 7% of the Senate were newly elected \"freshmen.\" At the beginning of the 116 th Congress, 144 House Members, including 1 Delegate and the Resident Commissioner (32.7% of House Members), had no more than two years of House experience, and 19 Senators (19% of Senators) had no more than two years of Senate experience. For more historical information on the tenure of Members of Congress, see CRS Report R41545, Congressional Careers: Service Tenure and Patterns of Member Service, 1789-2019 , by William T. Egar and Amber Hope Wilhelm. Ninety-seven percent of the Members of the 116 th Congress report an affiliation with a specific religion. Statistics gathered by the Pew Research Center on Religion and Public Life, which studies the religious affiliation of Representatives and Senators, and CQ at the beginning of the 116 th Congress showed the following: 54.9% of Members (233 in the House, 60 in the Senate) are Protestant, with Baptist as the most represented denomination, followed by Methodist; 30.5% of Members (141 in the House, 22 in the Senate) are Catholic; 6.4% of Members (26 in the House, 8 in the Senate) are Jewish; 1.9% of Members (6 in the House, 4 in the Senate) are Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints); 2 Members (1 in the House, 1 in the Senate) are Buddhist, 3 Representatives are Muslim, and 3 Representatives are Hindu; and other religious affiliations represented include Greek Orthodox, Pentecostal Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and Adventist. A record 131 women Members (24.2% of the total membership) serve in the 116 th Congress, 22 more than at the beginning of the 115 th Congress. One hundred six women, including 3 Delegates as well as the Resident Commissioner, serve in the House and 25 in the Senate. Of the 106 women in the House, 91 are Democrats, including 2 of the Delegates, and 15 are Republicans, including 1 Delegate as well as the Resident Commissioner. Of the 25 women in the Senate, 17 are Democrats and 8 are Republicans. By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), 23 women served in the House, and 2 in the Senate. Approximately 45 years ago, in the 94 th Congress (1975-1976), there were 19 women in the House, and none in the Senate. There are a record 58 African American Members (10.7% of the total membership) in the 116 th Congress, 6 more than at the beginning of the 115 th Congress. Fifty-five serve in the House, including two Delegates, and three serve in the Senate. This number includes one Representative, as well as one Senator, who are of African American and Asian ancestry, and two Representatives who are of African American and Hispanic ancestry. In this report, each of these four Members is counted as belonging to two ethnic groups. Fifty-four of the African American House Members, including two Delegates, are Democrats, and one is a Republican. Two of the Senators are Democrats and one is Republican. Twenty-four African American women, including two Delegates, serve in the House, and one serves in the Senate. By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), 21 African American Members served in the House, and none in the Senate. About 60 years ago, in the 87 th Congress (1961-1962), there were 4 African American Members of Congress, all serving in the House. There are 50 Hispanic or Latino Members in the 116 th Congress, 9.2% of the total membership and a record number. Forty-five serve in the House, including two delegates and the Resident Commissioner, and 5 in the Senate. These numbers include two House Members who are also of Asian descent, and two House Members also of African ancestry; these Members are counted in both ethnic categories in this report. Of the Members of the House, 37 are Democrats (including 2 Delegates) and 8 are Republicans (including the Resident Commissioner). Fourteen are women, including the Resident Commissioner. Of the five Hispanic Senators (three Republicans, two Democrats), one is a woman. By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), 14 Hispanic or Latino Members served in Congress. All 14 were male Members of the House. A record 20 Members of the 116 th Congress (3.8% of the total membership) are of Asian, South Asian, or Pacific Islander ancestry. Seventeen of them (16 Democrats, 1 Republican) serve in the House, and 3 (all Democrats) serve in the Senate. These numbers include one House Member and one Senator who are also of African American ancestry, and another House Member of Hispanic ancestry; these Members are counted in both ethnic categories in this report. Of those serving in the House, three are Delegates. Ten of the Asian, Pacific Islander, or South Asian American Members are female: seven in the House, and all three in the Senate. By comparison, approximately 35 years ago in the 99 th Congress (1985-1986), there were five Asian/Pacific Islander Americans in the House, and two in the Senate. There are four American Indian (Native American) Members of the 116 th Congress; two of each party, all in the House. This is two more than in the 115 th Congress, and a record number. Twenty-four Representatives and five Senators (5.3% of the 116 th Congress) were born outside the United States. Their places of birth include Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Germany, Japan, Peru, and India. Some of these Members were born to American citizens working or serving abroad. The U.S. Constitution requires that Representatives be citizens for seven years and Senators be citizens for nine years before they take office. At the beginning of the 116 th Congress, there were 96 individuals (17.8% of the total membership) who had served or were serving in the military, 6 fewer than at the beginning of the 115 th Congress (102 Members). According to lists compiled by CQ , the House as of January 2019 had 78 veterans (including 4 female Members, as well as 1 Delegate); the Senate had 18 veterans, including 3 women. These Members served in the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and combat or peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo, as well as during times of peace. Eight House Members and one Senator are still serving in the reserves, and seven House Members are still serving in the National Guard. Four of the seven female veterans are combat veterans. The number of veterans in the 116 th Congress reflects the trend of steady decline in recent decades in the number of Members who have served in the military. For example, 64% of the Members of the 97 th Congress (1981-1982) were veterans, and in the 92 nd Congress (1971-1972), 73% of the Members were veterans.

{"input": "", "context": "The rules of the House of Representatives generally grant Members an opportunity to review legislative measures by governing the length of time the measures must be made available before being considered on the floor. Different House rules establish availability requirements for reported bills and resolutions, unreported bills and joint resolutions, conference committee reports, and special rules (resolutions reported by the Rules Committee intended to regulate floor consideration of a measure named in the resolution). Under House rules, draft committee reports and unreported bills and joint resolutions are considered available under these rules if they are \"publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration.\" Conference committee reports and accompanying joint explanatory statements are also considered available if they are in electronic form at such a location. It is not a requirement under the rule that the measures be available in the designated location. Instead, the House rule is meant to provide an additional means through which Members, congressional staff, and the general public can access these documents. Measures and other matters reported by committees may not be considered on the House floor until a draft of the committee report on the matter has been available for at least 72 hours. Specifically, the \"proposed text\" of the committee report—except for any supplemental, minority, additional, or dissenting views—must be made available. Under House Rule XI, clause 2(l), committee members are guaranteed two calendar days to submit supplemental or other views for inclusion in a committee report—if notice of intent to file supplement views was given at the markup. However, the committee majority, before receiving such views, can make a draft of the committee report available and start the 72-hour clock. The House rule exempts several kinds of measures specified in the rule, including resolutions reported by the Rules Committee. Bills and joint resolutions that have not been reported by committee, and therefore are not accompanied by a written report, may also not be considered on the House floor unless the measure has been available for at least 72 hours. If a measure has not been reported by a committee, it is generally not eligible for floor consideration unless it is called up under a procedure that waives the requirement that it be reported. Such procedures are discussed below in the section on waiving the availability requirements. The House rule requires that before a conference report can be considered, its text and its accompanying joint explanatory statement must be available in the Congressional Record for 72 hours. Alternatively, the conference report can be considered if it has been made publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration (currently http://docs.house.gov/ ) . In addition, copies of a conference report and the joint explanatory statement must be available for at least two hours prior to its consideration. According to the rule, this 72-hour availability requirement does not apply during the last six days of a session. In contemporary practice, however, it is difficult to implement this exception to the rule. Adjournment resolutions are usually not approved until very shortly before the adjournment takes place. This practice usually makes it impossible to know when the \"last six days\" of a session begin. Absent a resolution setting a future date for adjournment, the 72-hour rule applies even as the House nears the end of a session. The 72-hour availability requirement for conference reports would cease to apply only in the last six calendar days before the constitutional end of a session on January 3. Near the end of a session, however, the House sometimes agrees to special rules reported by the Rules Committee that waive the availability requirement. This is discussed below in the section on waiving availability requirements. The House frequently operates under special rules, or resolutions reported from the Rules Committee, which can waive any or all of the above rules . Special rules are required to lie over for one legislative day, which means the special rule cannot be reported and considered on the same legislative day. A legislative day is not necessarily a calendar day. A legislative day begins the first time the House meets after an adjournment and ends when the House adjourns again. Because the House typically adjourns at the end of a calendar day, legislative and calendar days usually coincide. Rule XIII also provides several exceptions to the layover requirement for special rules. First, a special rule may be considered the same day it is presented if it proposes only to waive the rules mandating that committee reports and conference reports be available for 72 hours. If the rule also sets the terms for the consideration of the matter, perhaps by waiving points of order, then the rule is required to lie over for one legislative day. Second, a special rule may be considered the same day it is presented to the House in the last three days of a session. In modern practice, as mentioned above, the House rarely agrees to an adjournment date far in advance, usually making it impossible to know when \"the last three days\" begin. Third, the one-day layover requirement for special rules can be waived if two-thirds of the Members voting agree to the waiver (a quorum being present). In addition, as discussed below, the Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives the one-day layover requirement for subsequent special rules. The House has several means for waiving its rules when it wishes to act expeditiously. For example, the House may set aside any of its availability requirements by unanimous consent. It may also call up and agree to a bill or conference report that has not met the availability requirements by a two-thirds vote to suspend the rules. As previously mentioned, according to Rule XIII, clause 6(a)(1), the one-day layover requirement for a special rule can be waived by two-thirds of the Members voting. The House can also waive the availability requirements by a simple majority. If a majority of the House desires to do so, the House can vote on a measure the same calendar day that the text was made available to Members. The House usually does this by agreeing to two special rules, as explained below. It may also achieve the same result by convening for two legislative days on the same calendar day in the manner also described below. The Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives the 72-hour availability requirement for bills, resolutions, or conference reports. A rule only waiving the availability requirement can be presented and called up on the same day. Special rules, however, often set the terms for considering a measure as well. A special rule for the consideration of a measure might waive the 72-hour availability requirement but also structure the amending process. Such a rule would be required to lie over for one legislative day (unless this requirement was waived by a two-thirds vote). Similarly, a rule for the consideration of a conference report often waives points of order against the conference report and against its consideration. Under current House rules, that special rule is also required to lie over for one legislative day unless the requirement is waived by a two-thirds vote. In short, special rules only waiving the 72-hour availability requirement are not required to lie over for one legislative day. To waive the one-day layover requirement of Rule XIII, clause 6(a), for a special rule, the Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives this requirement. The rule providing this waiver is subject to the same one-day layover requirement. If such a special rule is adopted, the House can then consider and adopt a special rule providing for the consideration of a measure later on the same legislative day. The special rule for the consideration of the measure can waive the 72-hour availability requirement for the measure. In this way, the House of Representatives, by majority vote, has the potential to call up, debate, and pass a measure in a single day even if the measure has not been made available prior to consideration. In order to achieve this result, however, the Rules Committee must have reported the additional special rule on the previous legislative day. In summary, a simple majority of the House can call up, debate, and vote on a measure in a single calendar day, regardless of how long the text has been available, by taking the following steps: First, the House agrees to a special rule waiving the one-day layover requirement for any special rule for the consideration of a specified matter. (This rule is required to lie over for one legislative day.) Second, the House agrees to a separate special rule setting the terms of consideration of the measure and waiving any availability requirements for the measure itself. (This rule need not lie over for one legislative day. The first special rule waived the one-day layover requirement for this special rule.) Third, the House calls up, debates, and votes on the measure. Although the House rarely chooses to do so, it could agree to call up and consider a measure in a single calendar day by convening two legislative days in a single calendar day. It would do this by agreeing to a motion to adjourn for a brief period at some point during its session. Agreement to this motion would terminate the legislative day, and when the House returned from its brief adjournment pursuant to this motion, a new legislative day would begin. If the Rules Committee presents a special rule before the House adjourns, the rule can be considered on the next legislative day regardless of how much time has elapsed. In other words, if a special rule were reported, and the House adjourned and then shortly thereafter reconvened, the special rule would have been available for one legislative day, meeting the layover requirement of the standing rule. The House could then consider the special rule that, among other things, could waive the 72-hour availability requirement for a resolution, bill, or conference report. From time to time, the House has also been known to recess after legislative business, but not adjourn, in order to give the Rules Committee time to complete and report a special rule. The rule could be reported very late or even early in the morning of the next calendar day. Regardless of whether or not it is the next calendar day when the rule is reported, if the House adjourns after it is reported, when it reconvenes it will be a new legislative day, and the layover requirement will be considered met. In the contemporary House, it is not uncommon for the Rules Committee to report several special rules at the end of a session that waive the availability requirements for subsequent special rules for the consideration of certain specified measures. In the past, the House has also agreed to resolutions reported by the Rules Committee near the end of a session that waived availability requirements in general. Special rules that waive availability requirements are sometimes referred to as \"same day rules.\" They are also sometimes referred to, particularly by their opponents, as \"martial law\" rules. The term has been used by Members of the House for at least 15 years, but it has not been applied consistently to any one type of special rule. It has been used, for example, to describe both special rules that waive the one-day layover requirement for subsequent special rules and to describe broad special rules that trigger some provisions of House rules and waive others for the remaining duration of a session. Supporters of end-of-session resolutions that waive availability requirements sometimes argue that these special rules are meant to achieve the same end as the standing rules that make certain provisions of House rules inapplicable during the final days of the session. As mentioned above, the 72-hour availability requirement for conference reports does not apply in the last six days of a session. The one-day layover requirement for special rules does not apply in the last three days of a session. In recent years, Congress has not agreed to a concurrent resolution setting an adjournment date until just before adjournment takes place. As a result, these standing rules are not triggered in the contemporary House. By agreeing to a same-day rule near the end of the session, the House can achieve the same end as the existing, but technically inapplicable, standing rules that waive availability requirements at the end of a session. Opponents of these end-of-session resolutions sometimes argue that all Representatives should be guaranteed some time to examine legislative proposals regardless of when they are presented during the course of a session.", "answers": ["House rules govern the length of time legislative measures must be available to Members before being considered on the floor.

{"input": "", "context": "This report addresses frequently asked questions related to the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for executive, administrative, and professional employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). For a history of DOL regulations on the EAP exemptions, see CRS Report R45007, Overtime Exemptions in the Fair Labor Standards Act for Executive, Administrative, and Professional Employees , by David H. Bradley. For a broader overview of the FLSA, see CRS Report R42713, The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): An Overview . This report proceeds in three sections. First, there is an overview of the main federal statute on overtime pay—the FLSA—and of defining and delimiting the EAP exemptions. Second, there is a discussion of the applicability of the EAP exemptions. Finally, there is information on the EAP exemptions in the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule (which was finalized but invalidated before it took effect). The FLSA, enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Section 7(a) of the FLSA specifies that unless an employee is specifically exempted in the FLSA, he or she is considered to be a covered \"nonexempt\" employee and must receive pay at the rate of one-and-a-half times (\"time and a half\") the employee's regular rate for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. When the FLSA was enacted, Section 13(a)(1) provided an exemption, from both the minimum wage (Section 6) and overtime (Section 7) provisions of the act, for \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, and professional capacity.\" Rather than define the terms executive, administrative, or professional employee, the FLSA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit these terms \"from time to time\" by regulations . The general rationale for including the EAP exemption in the FLSA at the time of enactment was twofold. One, the nature of the work performed by EAP employees seemed to make standardization difficult and thus output of EAP employees was not as clearly associated with hours of work per day as it was for typical nonexempt workers. Two, bona fide EAP employees were considered to have other forms of compensation (e.g., above-average benefits, greater opportunities for advancement) not available to nonexempt workers. As mentioned, the Secretary of Labor is authorized to define and delimit the EAP exemptions. Including the first rulemaking on EAP exemptions in 1938, DOL has finalized nine rules. Although the determinations have changed over time, to qualify for an exemption currently under Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA (i.e., not to be entitled to overtime pay), an employee generally has to meet three criteria: 1. The \"salary basis\" test: the employee must be paid a predetermined and fixed salary. 2. The \"duties\" test: the employee must perform executive, administrative, or professional duties. 3. The \"salary level\" test: the employee must be paid above the threshold established in the rulemaking process, typically expressed as a per week rate. To qualify for the EAP exemption, an employee must be paid on a \"salary basis,\" rather than on a per hour basis. That is, an EAP employee must receive a predetermined and fixed payment that is not subject to reduction due to variations in the quantity or quality of work. The salary must be paid on a weekly or less-frequent basis. Job titles alone do not determine exemption status for an employee. Rather, the Secretary of Labor, through issuance of regulations, specifies the duties that EAP employees must perform to be exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. To qualify for the exemption for executive employees , all of the following job duties tests must be met: the employee's primary duty \"is management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof\"; the employee \"customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees\"; and the employee \"has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.\" To qualify for the exemption for administrative employees , both of the following job duties tests must be met: the employee's primary duty \"is the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer's customers\"; and the employee's primary duty \"includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\" To qualify for the exemption for professional employees , the following job duties test must be met: The employee's primary duty is the performance of work requiring \"knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction\"; or work \"requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.\" In addition to the duties test, an employee must earn above a certain salary in order to qualify for the EAP exemption. Since the FLSA was enacted and the first salary thresholds were established in 1938, the standard salary level thresholds have been raised nine times. Prior to 2004, the salary level for exemption varied by the type of employee and the type of duty test. In addition to the standard salary level, in 2004 DOL created a \"highly compensated employee\" (HCE) exemption in which employees earning an amount above the standard EAP salary threshold annually are exempt from overtime requirements if they perform at least one (among many) of the duties of an EAP employee. Because the FLSA applies to \"employees,\" individuals who are classified as independent contractors are not covered by the FLSA provisions. Yes. There is no general exemption for nonprofits in the FLSA or the EAP overtime regulations. Coverage for workers in nonprofits, like other entities, is determined by the enterprise and individual coverage tests. It is important to note, however, that charitable activities often associated with nonprofits do not count as ordinary commercial activities and thus do not count toward the $500,000 threshold for enterprise coverage under the FLSA. Only the commercial activities of nonprofits (e.g., gift shops, fee for service activities) count toward that threshold. On the other hand, even if a nonprofit does not meet the enterprise test for coverage, individual employees in an otherwise exempt nonprofit may be covered by the FLSA and the overtime rules if they engage in interstate commerce (e.g., regularly making out of state phone calls, processing credit card transactions). Yes. Both the FLSA and the EAP overtime regulations apply to institutions of higher education (IHEs). Due to other provisions of the FLSA, however, many personnel at IHEs are not eligible for overtime on the basis of the duties test alone and thus are unaffected by changes in the EAP standard salary level for exemption. For example, in general, bona fide teachers are exempt regardless of salary level and thus are not eligible for overtime. Similarly, academic administrative personnel are exempt from overtime pay if they are paid at least the EAP salary level threshold or are paid at least equal to the entrance salary for teachers at the same institution. On the other hand, some IHE workers would be affected by changes in the EAP salary level for exemption, including postdoctoral researchers who are employees, nonacademic administrative employees, and other salaried workers who are not covered by another exemption. Finally, like some public sector employers, but unlike private sectors employers, public IHEs may have the option of using compensatory time (i.e., a rate of 1.5 hours for each hour of overtime), rather than cash payment, to meet the obligation of providing overtime compensation. Yes. There is no blanket exemption from FLSA and overtime rule coverage for state and local governments. In general, employees of state and local governments are covered by the overtime provisions of the FLSA and thus are affected by EAP rulemaking updating the salary level threshold for the EAP exemptions. That said, other FLSA provisions apply to state and local governments that affect the applicability of overtime rules to these public sector employees. One way in which FLSA overtime rules apply differently in the public sector relates to the mode of compensation. State and local governments may have the option of using compensatory time, at a rate of 1.5 hours for each hour of overtime, rather than cash payment to meet the obligation of providing overtime compensation—an alternative not available to private sector employers. Additionally, some public sector employees are not covered by the FLSA. For instance, certain state and local employees—elected officials, their appointees and staff who are not subject to civil service laws, and legislative branch employees not subject to civil service laws—are not covered and will not be affected by changes to the EAP exemptions. The FLSA provides partial exemptions from the overtime requirements for fire protection and law enforcement employees. Specifically, fire protection and law enforcement employees are exempt from overtime pay requirements if they are employed by an agency with fewer than five fire protection or law enforcement employees. In addition, the FLSA allows overtime for all fire protection and law enforcement employees (not just those in small agencies) to be calculated on a \"work period\" (i.e., 7 to 28 consecutive days) rather than the standard \"workweek\" period (i.e., 7 consecutive 24-hour periods). Yes. The FLSA overtime provisions apply to employees in the U.S. territories—American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While the exemption for American Samoa has traditionally been set at 84% of the standard salary level, the other territories have been subject to the standard level. The application of the provisions of the FLSA is determined by the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA, P.L. 104-1 ), which was enacted in 1995 and extends some FLSA provisions, including overtime provisions, and other labor and workplace laws to congressional employees. In addition, the CAA created the Office of Compliance (now the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights), headed by a five-member Board of Directors (Board), to enforce the CAA. Rulemaking on the EAP exemptions would apply to congressional staff if the Board adopts them and Congress approves the Board's regulations, pursuant to the process established in the CAA. In other words, regulations adopted by the Board do not have legal effect until they are approved by Congress. When the Secretary of Labor issued new regulations to update the EAP exemptions in 2004, the Board adopted them; but thus far, Congress has apparently not approved the 2004 overtime regulations. Thus, overtime regulations that were adopted by the Board and approved by Congress in 1996, based on DOL regulations originally promulgated in 1975, currently apply to congressional staff. In the absence of action by the Board and by Congress, the provisions in any future final rules would not change the status quo. Congress can pass legislation to repeal rules or compel new rules. For example, prior to the publication of the 2016 final rule, legislation was introduced that would have prohibited the Secretary of Labor from enforcing the final rule and would have required additional analysis from the Secretary before the issuance of any substantially similar rule in the future. Given that rulemaking on the EAP exemptions typically includes increases in the salary level threshold for the EAP exemption, a greater number of employees become eligible for overtime pay with each upward adjustment of the salary level. To comply with the proposed regulations, employers would have several options, including the following: pay overtime to newly covered EAP employees if they work more than 40 hours in a workweek; increase the weekly pay for workers near the salary threshold to a level above it so that the EAP employees would become exempt and thus not be eligible for overtime pay; reduce work hours of nonexempt (covered) employees to 40 or fewer so that overtime pay would not be triggered; hire additional workers to offset the reduction in hours from nonexempt employees; or reduce base pay of nonexempt workers and maintain overtime hours so that base pay plus overtime pay would not exceed, or would remain close to, previous employer costs of base pay plus overtime. This section provides an overview of the main provisions of the 2019 proposed rule on EAP exemptions. For context, some provisions of the 2016 final rule are discussed. A final rule updating the EAP exemptions was published in the Federal Register on May 23, 2016, with an effective date of December 1, 2016. However, on November 22, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of the rule. On August 31, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled that DOL exceeded its authority by setting the threshold at the salary level in the 2016 final rule ($913 per week) and thus invalidated it. Subsequently, DOJ appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which granted DOJ's motion to hold the appeal in abeyance until DOL issued new rulemaking on the EAP salary level. Thus, DOL is currently enforcing the EAP regulations in effect on November 30, 2016, which include a standard salary level of $455 per week. DOL issued a request for information (RFI) related to the EAP exemptions on July 26, 2017, seeking information from the public to assist in formulating a proposal to revise the exemptions. On March 22, 2019, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published in the Federal Register to define and delimit EAP exemptions. The proposed rule would not only revise the regulations on the EAP exemptions but would also formally rescind the 2016 final rule. Such a rescission would provide that if any or all of the substantive provisions of the 2019 rule were invalidated or not put into effect, the EAP regulations would revert to those promulgated in the 2004 final rule. Due to the invalidation of the 2016 final rule (discussed above), DOL currently enforces the provisions of the 2004 final rule. The main changes to the EAP exemptions in the 2019 proposed rule, as summarized in Table 1 , include the following: an increase in the salary level test from the current $455 per week ($23,660 annually) to $679 per week ($35,308 annually); an increase in the annual salary threshold for the HCE exemption from $100,000 to $147,414; an allowance that up to 10% of the standard salary level may be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions; a salary level of $455 per week for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and of $380 in American Samoa; and an increase in the \"base rate\" weekly salary level for employees in the motion picture industry from $695 per week to $1,036 per week. Since the FLSA was enacted in 1938, the salary level threshold has been increased eight times, including the proposed 2019 increase. Each of the previous increases have occurred through intermittent rulemaking by the Secretary of Labor, with periods between adjustments ranging from 2 years (1938–1940) to 29 years (1975–2004). Since 1938, measures of the salary level have fluctuated according to DOL's identification of data sources most suitable for studying wage distributions and the department's determinations of the proportion and types of workers who should be below salary thresholds, as well as its determinations of whether regional, industry, or cost-of-living considerations should be factored into salary tests. Starting with the 2004 final rule, DOL has used survey data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) in determining the salary level for the EAP exemptions, albeit with different methodological choices. Effective January 2020 (approximately), the standard salary level threshold would equal the 20 th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time non-hourly workers in the lowest-wage Census region, which in 2019 is the South, and/or in the retail sector nationwide. In 2020, about 20% of full-time salaried workers in the South region and/or the retail sector nationwide are estimated to earn at or below $679 per week ($35,308 annually). Effective January 2020 (approximately), the HCE salary level for the EAP exemptions would equal the annual earnings equivalent of the 90 th percentile of the weekly earnings of full-time non-hourly workers nationally. In 2020, 90% of full-time non-hourly workers are estimated to earn at or below $147,414 per year. Effective January 2020 (approximately), the salary level for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands would be $455 per week, and in American Samoa it would be $380 per week. Except for American Samoa, this would depart from past regulations by establishing a salary threshold for the territories below the standard level. Effective January 2020 (approximately), the motion picture industry employee salary level for the EAP exemption would be $1,036 per week. This level was derived by increasing the previous threshold ($695 per week) proportionally to the increase in the standard salary level. This would continue a special salary test created in 1953 for the motion picture industry that provides an exception to the \"salary basis\" test. Specifically, employees in the motion picture industry may be classified as exempt if they meet the duties tests for EAP exemption and are paid a \"base rate\" (rather than on a \"salary basis\") equal to the salary level for this exemption. The 2019 proposed rule would implement a commitment by DOL to update the EAP salary level thresholds every four years by submitting an NPRM for comment. If the 2019 proposed rule is finalized, DOL would publish its first proposed update on January 1, 2023, and subsequent updates every four years thereafter. The future salary level updates would be based on the same data source (CPS) and methodology of the salary levels established in the 2019 proposed rule: the standard salary level would be adjusted to the 20 th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census region and/or in the retail sector, the HCE salary level threshold would be adjusted to the 90 th percentile of annual earnings of full-time non-hourly workers nationally, and the quadrennial NPRM would seek comment on whether to update the salary level for the territories established in the 2019 proposed rule. The 2019 proposed rule would expand overtime coverage to EAP employees through a higher salary level threshold rather than through additional classes of employees. As such, EAP employees making between $455 per week (the current effective level) and the new rate of $679 per week in 2019 would likely become nonexempt (i.e., covered) by the overtime provisions and entitled to overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek. It is difficult to project the number of employees currently exempt under the EAP exemptions who would no longer be exempt under the 2019 proposed rule. This is due in part to uncertainty about potential employer responses, such as increasing salaries above the new threshold to maintain exemption for EAP employees. DOL estimates, with caveats, that approximately 4.9 million workers would be affected by the proposed rule. DOL identifies two groups in particular that would be affected—newly covered workers and workers with strengthened protections. Specifically, DOL estimates the following: In the first year under the provisions of the 2019 proposed rule, about 1.3 million EAP employees would become newly entitled to overtime pay due to the increase in the salary threshold: about 1.1 million employees in this group meet the duties test for the EAP exemption but earn between the current standard salary threshold ($455 per week) and the proposed threshold ($679 per week); and an additional 201,000 employees in this group meet the HCE duties test for exemption, but not the standard test, and earn at least the current HCE salary threshold ($100,000 per year) but less than the proposed threshold ($147,414 per year). An additional 3.6 million workers would receive \"strengthened\" overtime protections, including the following: An additional 2.0 million white collar workers who are paid on a salary basis and earn between the current salary threshold of $455 per week and the proposed threshold of $679 per week but do not meet the EAP duties test (i.e., they perform nonexempt work but might be misclassified) would gain overtime protections because their exemption status would not depend on the duties test. In other words, this group of workers would gain overtime coverage because the higher salary threshold would create a clearer line exemption test and reduce misclassification for exemption purposes. About 1.6 million salaried workers in blue collar occupations whose overtime coverage would have been clearer with the higher salary threshold. As DOL notes, this group of workers should currently be covered by overtime provisions but may not be due to worker classification. By comparison, DOL estimated that in the first year under the provisions of the 2016 final rule, approximately 13.1 million workers would have been affected. This total would have included about 4.2 million EAP employees who would have become newly entitled to overtime pay due to the increase in the salary threshold and an additional 8.9 million workers who would have received \"strengthened\" overtime protections. The data in Table 2 provide a summary of the estimated numbers of affected workers under the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule.", "answers": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2019 proposed rule would affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $679 per week in 2020. DOL estimates that about 4.9 million workers would be affected in the first year, including about 1.3 million EAP employees who would become newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million workers who would have overtime protection clarified and thereby strengthened.

{"input": "", "context": "An amphibious force is comprised of an (1) amphibious task force and a (2) landing force together with other forces that are trained, organized, and equipped for amphibious operations. The amphibious task force is a group of Navy amphibious ships, most frequently deployed as an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The landing force is a Marine Air- Ground Task Force—which includes certain elements, such as command, aviation, ground, and logistics—embarked aboard the Navy amphibious ships. A Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is the most-commonly deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force. Together, this amphibious force is referred to as an ARG-MEU. An ARG consists of a minimum of three amphibious ships, typically an amphibious assault ship, an amphibious transport dock ship, and an amphibious dock landing ship. Navy ships train to a list of mission- essential tasks that are assigned based on the ship’s required operational capabilities and projected operational environments. Most surface combatants, including cruisers, destroyers, and all amphibious ships, have mission-essential tasks related to amphibious operations. Figure 1 shows the current number of amphibious ships by class and a description of their capabilities. An MEU consists of around 2,000 Marines, their aircraft, their landing craft, their combat equipment, and about 15 days’ worth of supplies. The MEU includes a standing command element; a ground element consisting of a battalion landing team; an aviation element consisting of a composite aviation squadron of multiple types of aircraft; and a logistics element consisting of a combat logistics battalion. Marine Corps units also train to accomplish a set of mission-essential tasks for the designed capabilities of the unit. Many Marine Corps units within the command, aviation, ground, and logistics elements have an amphibious-related mission- essential task. To be certified in the mission-essential task of amphibious operations, Marine Corps units must train to a standard that may require the use of amphibious ships. The Marine Corps’ use of virtual training devices has increased over time, and advances in technology have resulted in the acquisition of simulators and simulations with additional capabilities designed to help individual Marines and units acquire and refine skills through more concentrated and repetitive training. For example, the Marine Corps utilizes a constructive simulation that provides commanders with training for amphibious operations, among other missions. The Marine Corps has introduced other virtual training devices to prepare Marines for operational conditions and for emerging threats, such as devices to replicate a variety of vehicles for driver training and egress trainers, among others. The Navy stated it does not utilize virtual training devices that simulate amphibious operations, including ship-to-shore movement. In our September 2017 report, we found that Navy and Marine Corps units deploying as part of ARG-MEUs completed required training for amphibious operations, but the Marine Corps has been unable to consistently accomplish training for other service amphibious operations priorities. Specifically, based on our review of deployment certification messages from 2014 through 2016, we found that each deploying Navy ARG completed training for the amphibious operations mission in accordance with training standards. Similarly, we found that each MEU completed all of its mission-essential tasks that are required during the predeployment training program. These mission-essential tasks cover areas such as amphibious raid, amphibious assault, and noncombatant evacuation operations, among other operations. However, we also reported that based on our review of unit-level readiness data from fiscal year 2014 through 2016, Marine Corps units were unable to fully accomplish training for other amphibious operations priorities. These shortfalls include home-station unit training to support contingency requirements, service-level exercises, and experimentation and concept development for amphibious operations. For example, Marine Corps officials cited shortfalls in their ability to conduct service- level exercises that train individuals and units on amphibious operations- related skills, as well as provide opportunities to conduct experimentation and concept development for amphibious operations. In our September 2017 report, we identified several factors that created shortfalls in training for amphibious operations priorities. Based on our analysis of interviews with 23 Marine Corps units, we found that all 23 units cited the lack of available amphibious ships as the primary factor limiting training for home-station units. The Navy’s fleet of amphibious ships has declined by half in the last 25 years, from 62 in 1990 to 31 today, with current shipbuilding plans calling for four additional amphibious ships to be added by fiscal year 2024, increasing the total number of amphibious ships to 35 (see fig. 2). Marine Corps officials from the 23 units we interviewed also cited other factors that limit opportunities for amphibious operations training, including the following: Access to range space. Seventeen of 23 Marine Corps units we interviewed identified access to range space as a factor that can limit their ability to conduct amphibious operations training. Unit officials told us that priority for training resources, including range access, is given to units that will be part of a MEU deployment, leaving little range time available for other units. Maintenance delays, bad weather, and transit time. Ten of 23 Marine Corps units told us that changes to an amphibious ship’s schedule resulting from maintenance overruns or bad weather have also reduced the time available for a ship to be used for training. The transit time a ship needs to reach Marine Corps units has further reduced the time available for training. High pace of deployments. Five of 23 Marine Corps units told us that the high pace of deployments and need to prepare for upcoming deployments limited their opportunity to conduct training for amphibious operations. In our September 2017 report, we identified some steps that the Navy and Marine Corps have taken to mitigate the training shortfall for their amphibious operations priorities, such as by better defining the amount of amphibious operations capabilities and capacity needed to achieve the services’ wartime requirements. However, we found these efforts are incomplete because the services’ current approach for amphibious operations training does not incorporate strategic training and leading risk-management practices. Specifically, we found that: The Marine Corps does not prioritize all available training resources. For Marine Corps units not scheduled for a MEU deployment, officials described an ad hoc process to allocate any remaining available amphibious ship training time among home- station units. Specifically, officials stated that the current process identifies units that are available for training when an amphibious ship becomes available rather than a process that aligns the next highest- priority units for training with available amphibious ships. The Navy and Marine Corps do not systematically evaluate a full range of training resource alternatives to achieve amphibious operations priorities. Given the limited availability of amphibious ships for training, the Navy and Marine Corps have not systematically incorporated selected training resource alternatives into home-station training plans. During our review, we identified a number of alternatives that could help mitigate the risk to the services’ amphibious capability due to limited training opportunities. These alternatives could include utilizing additional training opportunities during an amphibious ship’s basic phase of training; using alternative platforms for training, such as Marine Prepositioning Force ships; utilizing smaller Navy craft or pier-side ships to meet training requirements; and leveraging developmental and operational test events. The Navy and Marine Corps have not developed a process or set of metrics to monitor progress toward achieving its amphibious operations training priorities and mitigating existing shortfalls. Current reporting systems do not allow officials to assess the services’ progress in achieving amphibious operations priorities or to monitor efforts to establish comprehensive amphibious operations training programs. For example, we found that the Marine Corps does not capture complete data on the full demand for training time with Navy amphibious ships that could be used for such assessments. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Navy and Marine Corps develop an approach to prioritize available training resources, systematically evaluate among training resource alternatives to achieve amphibious operations priorities, and monitor progress toward achieving them. DOD concurred with our recommendation and stated that the Secretary of the Navy would develop an amphibious operations training construct capitalizing on the application of primary and alternative training resources. While the Marine Corps has stated that the use of virtual training could help mitigate some of the limitations of training in a live-only environment and taken some steps to integrate these devices into operational training, we identified gaps in its process to develop and use them. Specifically, based on our review of a selection of 6 virtual training devices, we found weaknesses in three key areas: Front-end planning. The Marine Corps’ process for conducting front- end planning and analysis to support the acquisition of its virtual training devices does not include consideration of critical factors for integrating virtual training devices into operational training, such as the specific training tasks the device is intended to address, how the device would be used to meet proficiency goals, or available time for units to train with the device. As a result, the Marine Corps does not have a reasonable basis to ensure that it is acquiring the right number and type of virtual training devices to meet its operational training needs. Expected and actual usage data. The Marine Corps does not consistently consider expected and actual usage data for virtual training devices to support its investment decisions. In the absence of these data, the Marine Corps risks sustained investment in virtual training devices that do not meet operational training needs. Training effectiveness. The Marine Corps does not consistently evaluate the effectiveness of its virtual training devices to accomplish operational training. Without a well-defined process to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of virtual training devices for training, the Marine Corps risks investing in devices whose value to operational training is undetermined. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Marine Corps develop guidance for the development and use of virtual training devices to address these gaps. DOD concurred with the recommendation and stated it would work with the Commandant of the Marine Corps in its development and implementation actions associated with the use of virtual training devices. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services, to include issuing strategic documents that discuss the importance of improving naval integration and establishing mechanisms to coordinate their amphibious operations training capabilities. However, in our September 2017 report we found that the services have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices that would help drive efforts to improve naval integration. Our prior work on interagency collaboration has found that certain practices can help enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies. I would like to highlight a few practices that would especially benefit the Navy and Marine Corps’ efforts to improve integration for amphibious operations. Common outcomes and joint strategy. The Navy and Marine Corps have issued strategic documents that discuss the importance of improving naval integration, but the services have not developed a joint strategy that defines and articulates common outcomes to achieve naval integration. This first critical step will enable them to fully incorporate other leading collaboration practices aimed at achieving a common purpose. Compatible policies, procedures, and systems. The Navy and Marine Corps have not fully established compatible policies and procedures, such as common training tasks and standards and agreed-upon roles and responsibilities, to ensure their efforts to achieve improved naval integration are consistent and sustained. We also found that some of the Navy and Marine Corps’ systems for managing and conducting integrated training are incompatible, leading to inefficiencies in the process to manage unit-level training events. Leverage resources to maximize training opportunities. The services are looking to better leverage available training resources for amphibious operations. However, we identified examples of potential training opportunities during surface warfare tactical training and community relations events where enhancing the services’ collaborative efforts could take greater advantage of available training time for amphibious operations. Mechanisms to monitor results and reinforce accountability. The Navy and Marine have not developed mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results in improving naval integration and to align efforts to maximize training opportunities. Service-level strategy documents establish critical tasks to improve naval integration, but do not constitute a process or mechanism to jointly reinforce accountability for their naval integration efforts. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Navy and Marine Corps clarify the organizations responsible and set time frames to define and articulate common outcomes for naval integration, and use those outcomes to develop a joint strategy, more fully establish compatible policies, procedures, and systems, better leverage training resources, and establish mechanisms to monitor results. DOD concurred with the recommendation and stated it will develop mutual service naval integration terminology, and training resource application and organizational monitoring constructs to achieve common amphibious operations training outcomes.

Navy and Marine Corps units that are deploying as part of an Amphibious Ready Group and Marine Expeditionary Unit (ARG-MEU) completed their required training for amphibious operations, but other Marine Corps units have been limited in their ability to conduct training for other amphibious operations–related priorities. GAO found that several factors, to include the decline in the fleet of the Navy's amphibious ships from 62 in 1990 to 31 today limited the ability of Marine Corps units to conduct training for other priorities, such as recurring training for home-station units (see figure). As a result, training completion for amphibious operations was low for some but not all Marine Corps units from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. The services have taken steps to address amphibious training shortfalls, such as more comprehensively determining units that require training. However, these efforts are incomplete because the services do not have an approach to prioritize available training resources, evaluate training resource alternatives, and monitor progress towards achieving priorities. Thus, the services are not well positioned to mitigate any training shortfalls. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services, but have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices to improve integration of the two services—naval integration—for amphibious operations. For example, the Navy and Marine Corps have not defined and articulated common outcomes for naval integration that would help them align efforts to maximize training opportunities for amphibious operations.

{"input": "", "context": "For the purpose of this report, an economic analysis is defined as an analysis that is intended to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of an action. Economic effects (hereafter also called “effects”) commonly include costs, benefits, and/or economic transfers (for example, transfer payments). Action is defined to include a government law, rule, regulation, project, policy, or program. An action may be examined in the context of legislation, regulation, advocacy, agency operations, or in response to certain events (such as a natural disaster, for example). An economic analysis may be prospective, examining an action that could be taken, or retrospective, examining the outcome of an action that has already been taken. Examples of economic analyses include: 1. An economic analysis of the costs of a government program, project, 2. An economic analysis of the benefits and costs of a government rule 3. An economic analysis of the impact of a proposed or existing regulation on regulated entities and consumers. 4. An economic analysis of an action in response to an event (for example, an analysis of a federal response to a natural disaster); 5. A benefit-cost analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis. GAO reviewed handbooks and guidance on economic analysis that have been issued by various government agencies and institutions and consulted with experts. (Appendix 1 details GAO’s objective, scope, and methodology.) In this Section, GAO synthetizes economic elements and concepts embodied in this literature for use by GAO in its assessment methodology for the review of an economic analysis. GAO identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. These key elements are: 1. Objective and scope— the objective and scope of the analysis. 2. Methodology— the methodology used to examine the economic effects. 3. Analysis of effects — the analysis of economic effects. 4. Transparency— the transparency of the analysis of economic effects. 5. Documentation— the documentation included in the analysis. These key elements are standard to the structure of analyses, generally speaking. That is, an analysis is performed to address an objective; the analysis is scoped to address that objective; the analysis adopts a methodology, which is used to analyze the economic effects of interest; and the analysis is transparent and properly documented. The emphasis on transparency is consistent with the final implementation guidelines of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). “The primary benefit of public transparency is not necessarily that errors in analytic results will be detected, although error correction is clearly valuable. The more important benefit of transparency is that the public will be able to assess how much of an agency’s analytic result hinges on the specific analytic choices made by the agency.” Having identified key elements to the structure of an economic analysis we synthetized for each key element, economic concepts embodied in the literature that we reviewed. For example, what might we be assessing under the key element: Objective and Scope? We considered economic concepts commonly identified across the documents we reviewed, and incorporated feedback from the experts and agencies with whom we consulted. The documents that we reviewed included, among others, Circulars A-94 and A-4 released by OMB, handbooks for economic analysis from federal and international agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), and the United Kingdom’s HM Treasury. These documents generally outline a methodical structure to an economic analysis. This methodical structure takes the form of a set of issues or sequence of steps to address while conducting the analysis. These issues or steps, in turn, embody economic concepts. For the purpose of developing our assessment methodology, we synthetized and categorized these economic concepts with the key elements that we identified—as listed below. The concepts for each listed key element are not intended to be exhaustive and do not supplant or alter existing requirements for economic analysis. Depending on the context in which an action is examined, GAO’s assessment of a key element could exclude some concepts, or extend beyond the concepts listed for that element. In such cases, GAO’s written assessment of the relevant key element will specify the concepts that were actually considered in the review process. The five key elements and economic concepts in GAO’s assessment methodology for an economic analysis are: 1. Key Element: Objective and Scope—the objective and scope of the analysis. The economic analysis explains the action examined and includes a rationale and justification for the action. The analysis states its objective. The scope of the analysis is designed to address this objective. Unless otherwise justified, the analysis focuses on economic effects that accrue to citizens and residents of the United States, and its time horizon is long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the action. 2. Key Element: Methodology—the methodology used to examine the economic effects. The economic analysis examines the effects of the action by comparing alternatives, using one of them as the baseline. Unless otherwise justified, it considers alternatives that represent all relevant alternatives, including that of no action. The analysis defines an appropriate baseline. The analysis justifies that the world specified under each alternative considered (including the baseline) represents the best assessment of what the world would be like under that alternative. The analysis identifies the important economic effects for each alternative considered, their timing, and whether they are direct or ancillary effects. 3. Key Element: Analysis of Effects—the analysis of economic effects. Where feasible, the economic analysis quantifies the important economic effects and monetizes them using the concept of opportunity cost. The analysis applies the criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, to compare these effects across alternatives. It controls for inflation and uses economically justified discount rates. Where important economic effects cannot be quantified, the analysis explains how they affect the comparison of alternatives. Where the equity and distributional impacts are important, the full range of these impacts is separately detailed and quantified, where feasible. 4. Key Element: Transparency—the transparency of the analysis of economic effects. The economic analysis describes and justifies the analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The analysis assesses how plausible adjustments to each important analytical choice and assumption affect the estimates of the economic effects and the results of the comparison of alternatives. The analysis explains the implications of the key limitations in the data used. Where feasible, the analysis adequately quantifies how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates, and the results of the comparison of alternatives. 5. Key Element: Documentation—the documentation included in the analysis. The economic analysis is clearly written, with a plain language summary, clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and results, and a conclusion that is consistent with these results. The analysis cites all sources used and documents that it is based on the best available economic information. The analysis documents that it complies with a robust quality assurance process and, where applicable, the Information Quality Act. The analysis discloses the use and contributions of contractors and outside consultants. In summary, GAO identifies five key elements, with associated economic concepts, to the structure of an economic analysis. GAO’s assessment methodology then examines the extent to which an economic analysis properly dealt with these key elements. GAO’s assessment methodology has two steps: (1) an assessment of each individual key element and (2) an overall assessment based on the assessment of the individual key elements. Below, these two types of assessment are discussed. While GAO’s assessment methodology typically considers all five key elements, there may be cases, for example depending on the scope of an engagement, where it may consider only certain key elements. In those cases, GAO may not be able to make an overall assessment. The first step in the review process is an assessment of the extent to which the economic analysis has considered and properly dealt with each key element. For each element, the outcome of the review is a written assessment and an assessment score. The written assessment details the extent to which the analysis considered and properly dealt with the element. To the extent that important limitations are identified in the review, the written assessment describes these limitations. This written assessment informs the assessment score, which is one of three mutually exclusive scores: 1. fully met—that is, the economic analysis has considered and properly dealt with the element; 2. partly met—that is, the economic analysis has only partly considered and properly dealt with the element; 3. not met—that is, the economic analysis has not considered or not properly dealt with the element. If the outcome is “partly met” or “not met,” the written assessment should describe the limitations of the analysis. Assessments are made from expertise in economics and with professional judgment. The guiding principles of a review are objectivity, integrity, and compliance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS). An assessment is contextual—that is, it is conditional on the evidence underlying the action examined, and the context in which it takes place. The assessment is also conditional on the reasonably obtainable information available at the time of the economic analysis that is being reviewed. A caveat may be added to the assessment if new information that would affect it, has become available and is reasonably obtainable since the analysis was made. Should the review of a key element exclude certain concepts, or extend beyond the concepts listed for that key element, GAO’s written assessment of the key element will specify the concepts that were actually considered in the assessment process. Once each element has been individually reviewed, an overall assessment is made of the extent to which the economic analysis accordingly informs decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of the action examined. Four outcomes are possible: 1. The analysis informs decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of the action examined. 2. The analysis informs, with caveats, decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of the action examined. (If this is the outcome, the review should describe the caveats in writing.) 3. The analysis needs additional work to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of the action examined. (If this is the outcome, the review should describe in writing the important limitations of the economic analysis.) 4. The analysis does not inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of the action examined. (If this is the outcome, the review should describe in writing the deficiencies of the analysis.) An economic analysis that has fully met all the key elements should be identified as informing decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of the action examined (this is outcome 1). This determination is neither an endorsement of the specific findings and conclusions of the analysis, nor is it a determination that these are correct. For example, a prospective analysis is predictive of a potential result, but cannot definitively determine the result. It is a determination that the analysis is adequately and properly designed, and accordingly, it can inform the public discourse about the economic effects of the action examined. The written statements added to outcomes 2–4 should refer to the review of the individual elements. The difference between outcomes 2 and 3 is a matter of degree and professional judgment. Generally speaking, the caveats under outcome 2 will be relatively minor or few, whereas the important limitations under outcome 3 are likely to be more consequential. Should the economic analysis suffer from major deficiencies in meeting the key elements, then outcome 4 may be appropriate. Our objective was to identify, for the purpose of developing GAO’s assessment methodology for the review of economic analysis, key methodological elements to the structure of an economic analysis that is intended to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of a public action. To address this objective, we reviewed existing Circulars issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), handbooks for economic analysis issued by federal agencies, international government agencies and institutions, and established textbooks on economic theory and benefit-cost analysis. We also solicited feedback from economics experts (in academia and public policy) and international audit agencies. We identified in our document review, five key elements to the structure of an economic analysis. These key elements are: (1) objective and scope; (2) methodology; (3) analysis of effects; (4) transparency; (5) documentation. These key elements are standard to the structure of analyses, generally speaking. That is, an analysis is performed to address an objective; the analysis is scoped to address that objective; the analysis adopts a methodology, which is used to analyze the economic effects of interest; and the analysis is transparent and properly documented. Having identified key elements to the structure of an economic analysis, we synthetized for each key element economic concepts embodied in the literature we reviewed. For example, what might we be assessing under the key element objective and scope? To do so, we looked for economic concepts commonly identified across the documents we reviewed and incorporated feedback from the experts and agencies that we consulted with. We then categorized these economic concepts across the key elements that we identified. Among the documents we reviewed in our process were the following: OMB Circular A-94, Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs, Revised (Oct. 29, 1992). Circular A-94 provides a checklist of whether an agency has considered and properly dealt with all the elements for sound benefit-cost and cost- effectiveness analyses. OMB Circular A-4, Regulatory Analysis, (Sept. 17, 2003). Circular A-4, released in collaboration with the Council of Economic Advisors, identifies key elements to the structure of economic analyses in regulatory proceedings. Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Regulatory Impact Analysis: A Primer (Washington, D.C.: The White House). The purpose of the primer is to offer a summary of OMB Circular A-4. Agency-issued handbooks for economic analysis, such as, for example, those issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We also reviewed The Green Book: appraisal and evaluation in central government, issued by HM Treasury, Government of the United Kingdom, (London; July, 2011). HM Treasury describes The Green Book as a best practice guide for all central departments and executive agencies, and covers projects of all types and size. The guide applies to appraisals—defined as any analysis used to support a government decision to adopt a new policy, or to initiate, renew, expand or re-orientate programs or projects that would result in measurable benefits and/or costs to the public—and evaluations—defined as retrospective analysis of a policy, program or project at its completion, conclusion or revision. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Guidelines for the review of Reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. While these guidelines are specific to the review of reports issued by the National Academies and outline review criteria that apply across a broad range of disciplines, not just economics, they provide review criteria for scientific analysis. We conducted our work from June 2017 to April 2018 in accordance with all sections of GAO’s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product. We provided a draft of this product for third-party outside review to experts at various U.S. and international government agencies and specialists.

{"input": "", "context": "As we found in our May 2018 report, in terms of how they meet their IEA 90-day reserve obligations, most other IEA members differ from the United States in two basic ways. First, as of December 2017, most other IEA members rely at least in part on private rather than public reserves to meet their obligations. As of December 2017, 18 of the 25 IEA members that met their 90-day reserve obligation and had a formal process for holding and releasing reserves relied entirely or in part on private reserves to meet their obligations. Specifically, based on IEA data as of December 2017, these 18 countries met their 90-day reserve obligations through private reserves and either had no public reserves or had public reserves of less than 90 days. Unlike the 18 countries that rely at least in part on private reserves, as of December 2017, the United States and 6 other IEA members met the 90-day reserve obligation exclusively through public reserves. The second way other IEA members differ from the United States is that most hold at least a third of their reserves as petroleum products, according to a 2014 IEA report. Holding petroleum products can be advantageous during certain disruptions because such reserves can be directly distributed to consumers, whereas crude oil must first be refined and turned into products, adding response time. In contrast, more than 99 percent of the SPR (665.5 million barrels as of March 2018) is held as crude oil. Because of the large U.S. refining sector, crude oil from the SPR can be domestically refined into petroleum products to meet demand. As we found in our May 2018 report, DOE has not identified the optimal size or the potential need for additional petroleum product reserves for the SPR. In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination had been conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the expected benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and was limited in several ways. In particular, in the review, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of projected fluctuations in net imports or the role of the private sector in responding to supply disruptions. Recent changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis. These changes are expected to continue to evolve— according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. In February 2005, we found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. In May 2018, we recommended that DOE (1) supplement its 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis that takes into account, among other things, the costs and benefits of a wide range of different SPR sizes and (2) take actions to ensure that it periodically conducts and provides to Congress a strategic review of the SPR. DOE partially agreed with the first recommendation and stated that it will conduct an additional analysis to assess the purpose, goals, and objectives of the SPR, taking into account private sector response, oil market projections, and any other relevant factors, that will lead to an evaluation of possible optimal sizes of the SPR in the future. DOE agreed with the second recommendation. DOE has also not fully identified whether additional regional petroleum product reserves should be part of the SPR. The Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015 recommended that DOE analyze the need for additional or expanded regional product reserves by undertaking updated cost- benefit analyses for all of the regions of the United States that have been identified as vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions. In response, DOE studied the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves in the West Coast and Southeast Coast, though it did not finalize or publicly release these studies. Nevertheless, the draft studies concluded that a product reserve in the Southeast would provide significant net economic benefits to the region and the United States, particularly in the event of a major hurricane, while further analyses are needed to determine the potential benefits of a reserve on the West Coast. According to DOE officials, the agency has no plans to conduct additional studies. Without completing studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves, DOE cannot ensure that it and Congress have the information they need to make decisions about whether additional regional product reserves are needed. In our May 2018 report, we recommended that DOE conduct or complete such studies. DOE disagreed with this recommendation, though we continue to believe that conducting these analyses will provide Congress with needed information. As we found in our May 2018 report, DOE has taken steps to account for the effects of congressionally mandated oil sales in its plans for modernizing the SPR, though DOE’s current plans, developed in 2016, are based on information largely developed prior to recent congressionally mandated sales of an additional 117 million barrels of oil. According to DOE documents, the SPR modernization program is focused on a life extension project to modernize aging infrastructure to ensure that the SPR will be able to meet its mission requirements for the next several decades. The project’s scope of work has undergone several revisions since its inception in response to changing conditions and requirements, according to the agency. DOE has estimated that the SPR’s modernization will cost up to $1.4 billion, and according to officials, the agency had spent $22 million as of the end of February 2018. According to DOE officials, in March 2018, DOE commenced a study— the SPR post-sale configuration study targeted for completion in October 2018—to examine potential future reserve configurations and to account for the effects of congressionally mandated sales on the reserve and its modernization. Information from the study will inform DOE’s updates to the SPR’s modernization plans, according to DOE officials. Although the SPR had a design capacity to hold 713.5 million barrels of oil, in January 2017, the SPR held 695 million barrels. As shown in figure 2, congressionally mandated sales will cause excess storage capacity to grow to 308 million barrels or more by the end of fiscal year 2027— meaning that about 43 percent of the SPR’s total design capacity to store oil would be unused. In its ongoing SPR post-sale configuration study, DOE plans to explore some options to use potentially excess SPR assets, such as spare storage capacity. In withdrawing oil to meet congressionally mandated oil sales currently in place (290 million barrels through fiscal year 2027), DOE could close at least one SPR site based on our analysis of projected excess storage capacity. For example, if DOE were to close the smallest SPR site, Bayou Choctaw in Louisiana, the agency could also explore selling the connected pipeline and marine terminal, which are currently being leased to a private company. DOE could also consider leasing excess storage capacity to other countries so that they could store oil at the SPR. DOE had not entered into any such leases with other countries and had not considered such leases as of May 2018 because, according to DOE, the SPR has historically lacked capacity to store additional oil. DOE had not proposed any of these options or explored the revenue the agency could generate by selling or leasing these assets. However, according to DOE officials, the agency will examine the feasibility of such options in the ongoing SPR post-sale configuration study. In the course of our work, we also identified other options for handling potentially excess SPR assets that DOE was not planning on examining as of May 2018, largely because DOE did not have the authority to pursue them, according to agency officials. First, DOE could explore leasing storage capacity to private industry. U.S. oil production has generally increased over the last decade. As a result, the private sector may want to lease excess SPR capacity, which may be cheaper than above-ground storage, according to a representative of a private company we interviewed. Fees for doing so could help defray SPR storage or maintenance costs. However, agency officials told us that the Energy Policy and Conservation Act gave DOE authority to lease underutilized storage to other countries but not to the private sector. Second, if Congress determines that the SPR holds oil in excess of that needed domestically, DOE could explore selling contingent contracts for the excess oil rather than selling the oil outright. Australian and New Zealand officials told us that such contracts would help their countries meet their IEA 90-day reserve obligations. Australian officials told us that they have discussed this option with DOE. Currently the United States and Australia have agreed, through an arrangement, to allow Australia to contract for petroleum stocks located in the United States and controlled by commercial entities. While the arrangement does not cover government-owned oil in the SPR, if it did, based on our analysis, DOE could generate up to approximately $15 million if Australia purchased the maximum allowable amount of oil specified in an arrangement through contracts for excess SPR oil in 2018. However, although the Energy Policy and Conservation Act allows DOE to lease underutilized storage to other countries, DOE lacks the authority to sell contracts for the oil and does not plan to seek this authority, according to DOE officials. DOE officials told us that they did not plan to examine these options. According to DOE’s real property asset management order, the agency is to identify real property assets that are no longer needed to meet the program’s mission needs and that may be candidates for reuse or disposal. Once identified, the agency is to undertake certain actions, including determining whether to dispose of these assets by sale or lease. As part of its SPR post-sale configuration study, DOE plans to determine whether it is appropriate to close SPR facilities, and the relative benefit of any closures would be informed by potential lease revenues from maintaining sites so they could be leased, according to agency officials. However, as mentioned previously, we identified other options for handling potentially excess SPR assets that DOE was not planning to examine in its study. Although DOE does not currently have the authority to implement these options, according to officials, examining their potential use, including possible revenue enhancement, could inform Congress as it examines whether it should grant such authority. Without examining a full range of options in the SPR post-sale configuration study, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. In May 2018, we recommended that in completing its ongoing SPR post-sale configuration study, DOE should consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets and, if needed, request congressional authority for the disposition of these assets. DOE agreed with this recommendation. Finally, as DOE takes steps to plan for the SPR’s modernization, ongoing uncertainty regarding the SPR’s long-term size and configuration have complicated DOE’s efforts. Congress has generally set the SPR’s size by mandating purchases or sales of oil. DOE officials told us they do not know whether Congress will mandate additional sales over the next 10 years or whether other changes may be required to the configuration of the reserve. Any additional congressionally mandated sales would require DOE to again revisit its modernization plans and assessments of the potential uses of any excess SPR assets. Oil market projections also have implications for the future of the SPR. The United States is projected to become a net exporter by the late 2020s and would then no longer have a 90-day reserve obligation, but it is projected to return to being a net importer between 2040 and 2050. These projected fluctuations could affect the desired size of the SPR in the future. Such uncertainties create risks for DOE’s modernization plans, as DOE may end up spending funds on facilities that later turn out to be unnecessary should Congress ultimately decide on a larger- or smaller-sized SPR than DOE anticipates. In May 2018, we suggested that Congress may wish to consider setting a long-range target for the size and configuration of the SPR that takes into account projections for future oil production, oil consumption, the efficacy of the existing SPR to respond to domestic supply disruptions, and U.S. IEA obligations. In conclusion, we found that given the constrained budget environment and the evolving nature of energy markets and their vulnerabilities, it is important that DOE endeavor to ensure that the SPR is an efficient and effective use of federal resources.

Since 2015, Congress has also mandated sales of SPR oil to fund the modernization of SPR facilities and other national priorities. DOE manages the SPR, whose storage and related infrastructure is aging, and has plans to modernize its facilities. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil, about 138 days of net imports. This testimony highlights GAO's May 2018 report on the SPR, including the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's documents and studies and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination was conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and was limited in several ways.

GAO recommended that DOE supplement its 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, and take actions to ensure the agency periodically conducts a strategic review of the SPR. DOE generally agreed with these recommendations. DOE has taken steps to account for congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. However, DOE's current plans, developed in 2016, are based on information largely developed prior to recent congressionally mandated sales of an additional 117 million barrels of oil. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, GAO reported that this study was not examining a full range of options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, according to officials, DOE does not currently have the authority to lease unused storage capacity to the private sector, and DOE was not planning to examine this option. If authorized, leasing unused SPR storage capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. GAO recommended that DOE should consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets and, if needed, request congressional authority for the disposition of these assets. DOE agreed with this recommendation. GAO made four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure it periodically reexamines the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets.

{"input": "", "context": "The Select Agent Program does not fully meet key elements of effective oversight. In particular, the program has oversight shortcomings related to each of our five key elements: independence, performing reviews, technical expertise, transparency, and enforcement. In addition, the program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its oversight efforts, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan. It did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan during the summer of 2017. First, regarding independence, the Select Agent Program is not structurally distinct and separate from all of the laboratories it oversees because the two components of the Select Agent Program are located in CDC and APHIS, both of which also have high-containment laboratories registered with the program. Many experts at our meeting raised concerns that the Select Agent Program cannot be entirely independent in its oversight of CDC and APHIS laboratories because the Select Agent Program is composed of divisions of those agencies. To help reduce conflicts of interest, the program has taken steps such as having APHIS lead inspections of CDC laboratories. However, it has generally done so in response to concerns raised by others. The program itself has not formally assessed all potential risks posed by its current structure and the effectiveness of its mechanisms to address those risks. The Office of Management and Budget’s Circular A-123 requires federal agencies to integrate risk management activities into their program management to help ensure they are effectively managing risks that could affect the achievement of agency objectives. In addition, federal internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. Without (1) regularly assessing the potential risks posed by the program’s current structure and the effectiveness of its mechanisms to address them and (2) taking actions as necessary to ensure any identified risks are addressed, the program may not be aware of or effectively mitigate impairments to its independence that could affect its ability to achieve its objectives. Second, regarding the ability to perform reviews, we found that the Select Agent Program performs several types of reviews to ensure compliance with regulatory and program requirements. However, the program may not target the highest-risk activities in its inspections, in part because it has not formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. For example, many experts at our meeting and laboratory representatives we interviewed raised concerns about the amount of time inspectors spend assessing compliance with inventory controls (e.g., by counting and examining vials containing select agents) and reviewing inventory records during the inspection process, which takes time away from inspecting other aspects of biological safety and security. Experts at our meeting said that these activities do little to reduce the risk of theft of select agents (a security concern) because samples could be clandestinely removed from vials and replicated without being detected by the inventory controls currently in place. Further, other laboratory representatives told us that activities to assess compliance with certain program requirements, such as time-consuming reviews of records, did little to reduce risk and were unnecessarily burdensome to both researchers and inspectors. These inspection activities are generally intended to address biological security concerns; however, recent high- profile incidents at registered laboratories have concerned biological safety rather than security. To improve the inspection process and identify trends and associations between inspection findings and risk, a 2015 internal review of the CDC component of the Select Agent Program recommended that the CDC and APHIS components of the program work together to analyze inspection and investigation data. According to program officials, they have not yet addressed the recommendation because they do not currently have adequate tools to do so, but the program is transitioning to a new database that will enhance their ability to identify trends and associations and thereby guide improvements to the inspection process. However, the program did not provide a plan for when or how the program will carry out these analyses to improve the inspection process. Federal internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. Without developing and implementing a plan to identify which laboratory activities carry the highest biological safety and security risks and to respond to those risks by aligning inspections and other oversight efforts to target those activities, the Select Agent Program will not have assurance that it is effectively balancing the potential safety and security gains from its oversight efforts against the use of program resources and the effect on laboratories’ research. We also found that the Select Agent Program did not fully meet the other three key elements of effective oversight: technical expertise, transparency, and enforcement. For example, although the program has taken steps to hire additional staff and enhance the technical expertise of its staff, workforce and training gaps remain. In addition, although the program has increased transparency about registered laboratories and violations of the select agent regulations to the public and registered laboratories since 2016, the information it shares is limited and there is no consensus about what additional information could be shared, given security concerns. Lastly, although the program has authority to enforce compliance with program requirements, it is still working to address past concerns about the need for greater consistency and clarity in actions it takes in exercising this authority. In addition to not fully meeting the five key elements of effective oversight, we found that the Select Agent Program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its shared oversight efforts across CDC and APHIS. For example, the program does not have a joint mission statement to collectively define what the program seeks to accomplish through its oversight. It also does not yet have a strategic plan. Agencies can use strategic plans to set goals and identify performance measures for gauging progress towards those goals. Strategic plans can also outline how agencies plan to collaborate with each other to help achieve goals and objectives. The program began taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan during the course of our review and, in August 2017, began soliciting bids from contractors for the plan’s development. The statement of work for the contract stipulates that the contractor shall develop guiding principles for the Select Agent Program along with a mission statement and strategic goals and objectives, among other requirements. However, it does not have any requirements related to development of a joint workforce plan. We have found in the past that agencies’ strategic workforce planning should be clearly linked to the agency’s mission and long-term goals developed during the strategic planning process. Developing a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training needs for the program as a whole would help the program to better manage fragmentation by improving how it leverages resources to ensure all workforce and training needs are met. Leveraging resources is especially important given fiscal constraints. In our report, we recommended that CDC and APHIS take several steps to address these findings. First, we made five recommendations to improve independence, including that CDC and APHIS regularly assess the potential risks posed by the program’s structure and the effectiveness of its mechanisms to address those risks, and take actions as necessary to ensure any identified risks are addressed so that impairments to independence do not affect its ability to achieve its objectives. Second, to improve the ability to perform reviews, we recommended that the directors of the Select Agent Program work together to develop and implement a plan to identify which laboratory activities carry the highest biological safety and security risks and to respond to those risks by aligning inspections and other oversight efforts to target those activities. We also made several other recommendations, including recommending that the directors of the Select Agent Program develop a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training needs for the program as a whole. Selected countries and regulatory sectors employ approaches to promote effective oversight that sometimes differ from those of the Select Agent Program by, for example, having regulatory bodies that are structurally independent from the entities they oversee or taking a risk-based approach to performing reviews. To illustrate, with regard to independence, Great Britain’s Health and Safety Executive, whose mission is to protect worker and public health and safety and which oversees laboratories that work with pathogens, is an independent government agency. According to officials from the Health and Safety Executive and laboratory representatives, one strength of this approach is that it avoids potential organizational conflicts of interest because none of the laboratories it oversees are part of the same agency. Some other regulatory sectors in the United States, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), are also structurally independent from regulated facilities as a mechanism to ensure independence. Prior to the creation of NRC in 1974, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was responsible for both promotion and oversight of the nuclear industry. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 established NRC as a separate, independent entity. According to a Senate committee report, this was a response to growing criticism that there was a basic conflict between the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission’s regulation of the nuclear power industry and its development and promotion of new technology for the industry. Related to the ability to perform reviews, regulators in Great Britain and Canada apply a risk-based approach by targeting laboratories with a documented history of performance issues or those conducting higher- risk activities. In both Great Britain and Canada, the organizations that oversee laboratories generally focus their oversight on (1) biological safety, and (2) regulation of all potentially hazardous pathogens in laboratories. In contrast, the Select Agent Program originated from security-related concerns and regulates only those pathogens identified on the U.S. select agent list and no other pathogens that may be handled in high-containment but are not select agents, such as West Nile virus. Other differences we found in approaches include relying on scientists and other laboratory personnel to have requisite technical expertise on the pathogens and activities in their laboratories, sharing incident information on their public websites, and having prosecutorial authority when incidents occur. In conclusion, CDC and APHIS share a critical role in ensuring that important research on select agents can be conducted in high- containment laboratories in a safe and secure manner. The Select Agent Program has made a number of improvements over the past few years, such as hiring additional staff and improving training to enhance expertise. Nevertheless, the program does not fully meet all key elements of effective oversight and more is needed to develop joint strategic plans to collectively guide its shared oversight efforts. In our prior work, we have found that existing federal oversight of high-containment laboratories is fragmented and largely self-policing, among other things. Our October 2017 report, in combination with these past findings, continues to raise questions about whether the current government framework and oversight are adequate. Vice Chairman Griffith, Ranking Member DeGette, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes our prepared statement. We would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have at this time.

This statement summarizes information contained in GAO's October 2017 report, titled High-Containment Laboratories: Coordinated Actions Needed to Enhance the Select Agent Program's Oversight of Hazardous Pathogens ( GAO-18-145 ). The Federal Select Agent Program—jointly managed by the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA)—oversees laboratories' handling of certain hazardous pathogens known as select agents. However, the program does not fully meet all key elements of effective oversight. For example, the program is not structurally independent from all laboratories it oversees and has not assessed risks posed by its current structure or the effectiveness of mechanisms it has to reduce organizational conflicts of interest. Without conducting such assessments and taking actions as needed to address risks, the program may not effectively mitigate impairments to its independence. In addition, some experts and laboratory representatives GAO interviewed raised concerns that the program's reviews may not target the highest-risk activities, in part because it has not formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk. Without assessing the risk of activities it oversees and targeting its resources appropriately, the program cannot ensure it is balancing its resources against their impact. Moreover, the program does not have strategic planning documents, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan, to guide its oversight. Although it began taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan, the program is not developing workforce plans as part of this effort. Developing a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training needs for the program as a whole would help the program leverage resources to ensure all workforce and training needs are met. Selected countries and regulatory sectors GAO reviewed employ other approaches to promote effective oversight. For example, in Great Britain, an independent government agency focused on health and safety oversees laboratories that work with pathogens. In addition, in both Great Britain and Canada, regulators (1) focus their oversight on biological safety, because safety incidents provided the impetus for laboratory oversight in these countries and (2) regulate all potentially hazardous pathogens and activities in laboratories. GAO's recommendations in GAO-18-145 included that the Federal Select Agent Program (1) assess risks posed by its current structure and address risks as needed; (2) assess the risk of activities it oversees and target reviews to the highest-risk activities; and (3) develop a joint workforce plan. HHS and USDA agreed with GAO's recommendations and outlined actions they are taking, or plan to take, to address them, which GAO will continue to monitor."], "length": 2456, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "caf71c812aee782e1de5a1092f377c96c1cec13842b312e5"}
{"input": "", "context": "The 340B Program was created following the enactment of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and gives 340B covered entities discounts on outpatient drugs comparable to those made available to state Medicaid agencies. HRSA is responsible for administering and overseeing the 340B Program. Eligibility for the 340B Program, which is defined in the PHSA, has expanded over time, most recently through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which extended eligibility to additional types of hospitals. Entities generally become eligible by receiving certain federal grants or by being one of six hospital types. Eligible grantees include clinics that offer primary and preventive care services, such as Federally Qualified Health Centers, clinics that target specific conditions or diseases that raise public health concerns or are expensive to treat, and AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, which serve as a “payer of last resort” to cover the cost of providing HIV-related medications to certain low-income individuals. Eligible hospitals include certain children’s hospitals, free-standing cancer hospitals, rural referral centers, sole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, and general acute care hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients, referred to as disproportionate share hospitals (DSH). To become a covered entity and participate in the program, eligible entities must register with HRSA and be approved. Entity participation in the 340B Program has grown over time to include more than 38,000 entity sites, including more than 21,000 hospital sites and nearly 17,000 federal grantee sites (see fig. 1). To be eligible for the 340B Program hospitals must meet certain requirements intended to ensure that they perform a government function to provide care to the medically underserved. First, hospitals generally must meet specified DSH adjustment percentages to qualify. Additionally, they must be (1) owned or operated by a state or local government, (2) a public or private nonprofit corporation that is formally delegated governmental powers by a unit of state or local government, or (3) a private, nonprofit hospital under contract with a state or local government to provide health care services to low-income individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. All drug manufacturers that supply outpatient drugs are eligible to participate in the 340B Program and must participate in order to have their drugs covered by Medicaid. To participate, manufacturers are required to sign a pharmaceutical pricing agreement with HHS in which both parties agree to certain terms and conditions. The 340B price for a drug—often referred to as the 340B ceiling price—is based on a statutory formula and represents the highest price a participating drug manufacturer may charge covered entities. Covered entities must follow certain requirements as a condition of participating in the 340B Program. For example covered entities are prohibited from subjecting manufacturers to “duplicate discounts” in which drugs prescribed to Medicaid beneficiaries are subject to both the 340B price and a rebate through the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. covered entities are also prohibited from diverting any drug purchased at the 340B price to an individual who does not meet HRSA’s definition of a patient. This definition, issued in 1996, outlines three criteria that generally state that diversion occurs when 340B discounted drugs are given to individuals who are not receiving health care services from covered entities or are only receiving non-covered services, such as inpatient hospital services. (See table 1 for more information on HRSA’s definition of an eligible patient.) Covered entities are permitted to use drugs purchased at the 340B price for all individuals who meet the 340B Program definition of a patient regardless of whether they are low-income, uninsured, or underinsured. A covered entity typically purchases and dispenses 340B drugs through pharmacies—either through an in-house pharmacy, or through the use of a contract pharmacy arrangement, in which the covered entity contracts with an outside pharmacy to dispense drugs on its behalf. The adoption and use of contract pharmacies in the 340B Program is governed by HRSA guidance. HRSA’s original guidance permitting the use of contract pharmacies limited their use to covered entities that did not have in-house pharmacies and allowed each covered entity to contract with only one outside pharmacy. However, March 2010 guidance lifted the restriction on the number of pharmacies with which a covered entity could contract. Since that time, the number of unique contract pharmacies has increased significantly, from about 1,300 at the beginning of 2010 to around 18,700 in 2017 (see fig. 2); and, according to HRSA data, in 2017, there were more than 46,000 contract pharmacy arrangements. HRSA guidance requires a written contract between the covered entity and each contract pharmacy. Covered entities are responsible for overseeing contract pharmacies to ensure compliance with prohibitions on drug diversion and duplicate discounts. HRSA guidance indicates that covered entities are “expected” to conduct annual independent audits of contract pharmacies, leaving the exact method of ensuring compliance up to the covered entity. Drug manufacturers also must follow certain 340B Program requirements. For example, HRSA’s nondiscrimination guidance prohibits manufacturers from distributing drugs in ways that discriminate against covered entities compared to other providers. This includes ensuring that drugs are made available to covered entities through the same channels that they are made available to non-340B providers, and not conditioning the sale of drugs to covered entities on restrictive conditions, which would have the effect of discouraging participation in the program. In our September 2011 report, we found that HRSA’s oversight of the 340B Program was weak because it primarily relied on covered entities and manufacturers to police themselves and ensure their own compliance with program requirements. Upon enrollment into the program, HRSA requires participants to self-certify that they will comply with applicable 340B Program requirements and any accompanying agency guidance, and expects participants to develop the procedures necessary to ensure and document compliance, informing HRSA if violations occur. HRSA officials told us that covered entities and manufacturers could also monitor each other’s compliance with program requirements, but we found that, in practice, participants could face limitations to such an approach. Beyond relying on participants’ self-policing, we also found that HRSA engaged in few activities to oversee the 340B Program and ensure its integrity, which agency officials said was primarily due to funding constraints. Further, although HRSA had the authority to conduct audits of program participants to determine whether program violations had occurred, at the time of our 2011 report, the agency had never conducted such an audit. In our 2011 report, we concluded that changes in the settings where the 340B Program was used may have heightened the concerns about the inadequate oversight we identified. In the years leading up to our report, the settings where the 340B Program was used had shifted to more contract pharmacies and hospitals than in the past, and that trend has continued in recent years. We concluded that increased use of the 340B Program by contract pharmacies and hospitals may have resulted in a greater risk of drug diversion to ineligible patients, in part because these facilities were more likely to serve patients that did not meet the definition of a patient of the program. To address these oversight weaknesses, we recommended that the Secretary of HHS instruct the Administrator of HRSA to conduct selective audits of covered entities to deter potential diversion. In response to that recommendation, in fiscal year 2012, HRSA implemented a systematic approach to conducting annual audits of covered entities that is outlined on its website. HRSA audits include entities that are randomly selected based on risk-based criteria (approximately 90 percent of the audits conducted each year), and entities that are targeted based on information from stakeholders (10 percent of the audits conducted). HRSA currently audits a total of 200 entities per year, which accounts for less than 2 percent of covered entities. (See table 2.) As a result of the audits already conducted, HRSA has identified instances of non-compliance with program requirements, including violations related to drug diversion and the potential for duplicate discounts. The agency has developed a process to address non- compliance through corrective action plans. The results of each year’s audits are available on HRSA’s website, and we currently have work underway reviewing HRSA’s efforts to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements at contract pharmacies that includes an examination of HRSA’s audits of covered entities. In our 2011 report, we found that HRSA’s guidance on three key program requirements lacked the necessary level of specificity to provide clear direction, making it difficult for participants to self-police or monitor others’ compliance, and raising concerns that the guidance could be interpreted in ways that were inconsistent with its intent. First, we found that HRSA’s nondiscrimination guidance was not sufficiently specific in detailing practices manufacturers should follow to ensure that drugs were equitably distributed to covered entities and non- 340B providers when distribution was restricted. Some stakeholders we interviewed for the 2011 report, such as covered entities, raised concerns about the way certain manufacturers interpreted and complied with the guidance in these cases. We recommended that HRSA further clarify its nondiscrimination guidance for cases in which distribution of drugs is restricted and require reviews of manufacturers’ plans to restrict distribution of drugs at 340B prices in such cases. In response, HRSA issued a program notice in May 2012 that clarified HRSA’s policy for manufacturers that intend to restrict distribution of a drug and provided additional detail on the type of information manufacturers should include in such restricted distribution plans. In addition, we found a lack of specificity in HRSA’s guidance on two other issues—the definition of an eligible patient and hospital eligibility for program participation. Specifically, we found that HRSA’s guidance on the definition of an eligible patient lacked the necessary specificity to clearly define the various situations under which an individual was considered eligible for discounted drugs through the 340B Program. As a result, covered entities could interpret the definition either too broadly or too narrowly. At the time of our report, agency officials told us they recognized the need to provide additional clarity around the definition of an eligible patient, in part because of concerns that some covered entities may have interpreted the definition too broadly to include non-eligible individuals, such as those seen by providers who were only loosely affiliated with a covered entity. HRSA had not issued guidance specifying the criteria under which hospitals that were not publicly owned or operated could qualify for the 340B Program. For example, we found HRSA guidance lacking on one of the ways hospitals could qualify for the program, namely by executing a contract with a state or local government to provide services to low-income individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. Specifically, we found that HRSA did not outline any criteria that must be included in such contracts, such as the amount of care a hospital must provide to these low-income individuals, and did not require the hospitals to submit their contracts for review by HRSA. As a result, hospitals with contracts that provided a small amount of care to low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare could claim 340B discounts, which may not have been what the agency intended. Given the lack of specificity in these areas, we recommended that HRSA (1) finalize new, more specific guidance on the definition of an eligible patient, and (2) issue guidance to further specify the criteria that hospitals not publicly owned or operated must meet to be eligible for the 340B Program. HRSA agreed with these recommendations and had planned to address them in a comprehensive 340B Program regulation that it submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in April 2014. However, HRSA withdrew this proposed regulation in November 2014 following a May 2014 federal district court ruling that the agency had not been granted broad rulemaking authority to carry out all the provisions of the 340B Program. After this ruling, the agency issued a proposed Omnibus Guidance in August 2015 to interpret statutory requirements for the 340B Program in areas where it did not have explicit rulemaking authority, including further specificity on the definition of a patient of a covered entity and hospital eligibility for 340B Program participation. However, in January 2017, the agency withdrew the guidance following the administration’s January 20 memorandum directing agencies to withdraw or postpone regulations and guidance that had not yet taken effect. In March 2018, HRSA indicated that it was working with HHS to determine next steps regarding the proposed Omnibus Guidance, which included the patient definition, but that it was unable to further clarify guidance on hospital eligibility without additional authority. HRSA also noted that the administration’s fiscal year 2019 budget proposal requests rulemaking authority, which, if enacted, would provide the agency with the authority to regulate hospital eligibility for the 340B Program. GAO has ongoing work related to 340B contract pharmacies and the characteristics of hospitals participating in the program. Specifically, given the increase in the number of contract pharmacies in the 340B Program and concerns that contract pharmacy arrangements present an increased risk to the integrity of the program, we were asked to review contract pharmacy use under the 340B Program. In our forthcoming report, we plan to describe the extent to which covered entities contract with pharmacies to distribute 340B drugs, and the characteristics of these pharmacies; describe financial arrangements selected covered entities have with contract pharmacies and third-party administrators related to the administration and dispensing of 340B drugs; describe the extent to which selected covered entities provide discounts on 340B drugs dispensed by contract pharmacies to low- income, uninsured patients; and examine HRSA’s efforts to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements at contract pharmacies. In addition, with the growth in the number of hospitals participating in the 340B Program and Medicaid coverage expansions as a result of PPACA, we were asked to review how hospitals that participate in the 340B Program compare to other hospitals. In our forthcoming report, we plan to address how hospitals that participate in the 340B Program compare to non- 340B hospitals in terms of certain characteristics; and how, if at all, the characteristics of 340B and non-340B hospitals changed after state Medicaid coverage was expanded under PPACA. We expect to issue these reports this summer. Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, and Members of the Committee, this concludes my statement.

Covered entities can provide 340B drugs to eligible patients regardless of income or insurance status and generate revenue by receiving reimbursement from patients' insurance. The program does not specify how this revenue is to be used or whether discounts are to be passed on to patients. The number of participating covered entity sites—currently about 38,000—has almost doubled in the past 5 years and the number of contract pharmacies increased from about 1,300 in 2010 to around 18,700 in 2017. In recent years, questions have been raised regarding oversight of the 340B Program, particularly given the program's growth over time. In September 2011, GAO identified inadequacies in HRSA's oversight of the 340B Program and made recommendations for improvement. Among other things, this statement describes HRSA actions in response to GAO recommendations to improve its program oversight. For this statement, GAO obtained information and documentation from HRSA officials about any significant program updates and steps they have taken to implement the 2011 GAO recommendations. More detailed information on the objectives, scope, and methodology can be found in GAO's September 2011 report. The 340B Drug Pricing Program requires drug manufacturers to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to covered entities—eligible clinics, hospitals, and others—in order to have their drugs covered by Medicaid. Covered entities are only allowed to provide 340B drugs to certain eligible patients. Entities dispense 340B drugs through in-house pharmacies or contract pharmacies, which are outside pharmacies entities contract with to dispense drugs on their behalf. The number of contract pharmacies has increased significantly in recent years. In its September 2011 report, GAO found that the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) oversight of the 340B Program was inadequate to ensure compliance with program rules, and GAO recommended actions that HRSA should take to improve program integrity, particularly given significant growth in the program in recent years. HRSA has taken steps to address two of GAO's four recommendations: HRSA initiated audits of covered entities . GAO found that HRSA's oversight of the 340B Program was weak because it primarily relied on covered entities and manufacturers to ensure their own compliance with program requirements and HRSA engaged in few oversight activities. GAO recommended that HRSA conduct audits of covered entities and in fiscal year 2012, HRSA implemented a systematic approach to conducting annual audits of covered entities. HRSA now audits 200 covered entities a year, which is less than 2 percent of entities participating in the 340B Program. Audits conducted to date have identified instances of non-compliance with program requirements, including the dispensing of drugs to ineligible patients. GAO currently has work underway reviewing HRSA's efforts to ensure compliance at contract pharmacies, which includes an examination of HRSA's audits of covered entities. HRSA clarified guidance for manufacturers. GAO found a lack of specificity in guidance for manufacturers for handling cases in which distribution of drugs is restricted, such as when there is a shortage in drug supply. GAO recommended that HRSA refine its guidance. In May 2012, HRSA clarified its policy for manufacturers that intend to restrict distribution of a drug and provided additional detail on the type of information manufacturers should include in their restricted distribution plans. HRSA has not clarified guidance on two issues. GAO also found that HRSA guidance on (1) the definition of an eligible patient and (2) hospital eligibility criteria for program participation lacked specificity and recommended that HRSA clarify its guidance. HRSA agreed that clearer guidance was necessary and, in 2015, released proposed guidance that addressed both issues. However, in January 2017, the agency withdrew that guidance in accordance with recent directives to freeze, withdraw, or postpone pending federal guidance. In March 2018, HRSA indicated it was in the process of determining next steps related to guidance on the patient definition, but would need additional authority to further clarify guidance on hospital eligibility; rulemaking authority for the 340B Program was requested in the administration's fiscal year 2019 budget proposal."], "length": 3187, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "08e24375adffea14cbb67ca5482af502e39144b4bce2d989"}
{"input": "", "context": "According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce is composed of an estimated 2.1 million civilian workers, and several federal agencies collect, compile, and publish statistics about this workforce. Source s may vary in their totals due to differences in how federal workforce statistics are compiled. Some sources rely on \"head counts\" of employees (OPM), some on total hours worked (such as the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]), some on surveys of employing agencies, and others on self-identification by workers surveyed in their homes. In addition, federal civilian employee databases may exclude particular departments, agencies, or branches of government. Some may also account for temporary or seasonal employees (such as those employed by the U.S. Census) depending on the time of year the statistics are generated. This report focuses on differences in methodologies, including exclusions, and the frequency of data collection employed by OMB and OPM to determine the size and scope of the federal workforce. These differences will facilitate the selection of appropriate data for specific purposes. One example of a key methodological distinction is the difference between \"full-time equivalents\" (FTEs) and on-board personnel. The following two examples illustrate how the FTE and on-board methods can be used to derive different federal workforce totals. Full-time equivalent employment is defined as the total number of regular straight-time hours (not including overtime or holiday hours) worked by employees divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. Work years, or FTEs, are not employee \"head counts.\" One work year, or one FTE, is equivalent to 2,080 hours of work. Table 1 offers examples in which there is a difference between the actual number of people and the number of FTEs working the same number of total hours. It also illustrates how measuring employment by hours can substantially change the perception of the number of employees it takes to accomplish the work. FTE employment numbers are used by OMB to manage employment in departments and agencies. The requirements for reporting FTE employment in the President's Budget are prescribed in Section 85 of OMB Circular No. A-11 on \"Estimating Employment Levels and the Employment Summary (Schedule Q).\" FTE data are published annually in OMB's the Budget of the United States Government under the individual department and agency accounts in the Appendix as well as in the Analytical Perspectives and Historical Tables volumes. OPM defines on-board employment as the number of employees in pay status at the end of the quarter. Data for on-board employment provide employee \"head count\" in most departments and agencies as of a particular date, including full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees. OPM's Employment and Trends report and OPM's FedScope database provide on-board employment headcounts. When calculating on-board personnel, the number of full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers at an agency is relevant. For example, an agency reporting 10 FTEs could conceivably report 20 \"on-board\" employees, depending on employees' work schedules. In addition, the \"on-board\" headcount may result in wide variances in employment numbers, depending on the specific date the employees are counted. For example, the Census Bureau hires 7,000 Census enumerators every 10 years. The federal on-board employees count is likely to be larger during the duration of their employment. OPM is an independent agency that functions as the central human resources department of the executive branch. In fulfilling its mission, OPM collects, maintains, and publishes data on a large portion of the federal civilian workforce. In FY2010, OPM established a system called the Enterprise Human Resources Integration-Statistical Data Mart (EHRI-SDM). This automated system provides access to personnel data for 96% of nonpostal federal civilian executive branch employees. The database does have exclusions; for example, not all executive branch agencies submit their personnel data to OPM. These exclusions include some national security and intelligence agencies, and the Postal Service. Even with these exclusions, the EHRI-SDM is widely regarded as the most comprehensive resource available on the size and scope of the federal workforce. More than 100 data elements are collected for each federal employee within the EHRI-SDM. These data are aggregated by OPM and published in the resources described below. FedScope is a website that provides public access to the EHRI-SDM, covering the most recent five years of employment, accession, and separation data provided by approximately 120 federal agencies. It is available at http://www.fedscope.opm.gov/ . FedScope data are presented in five subject categories, called \"cubes,\" each covering a different subject and time span. The following are descriptions of the data cubes available through FedScope: Employment . This set of cubes contains the total number of federal employees of the included agencies, as well as other information such as age, gender, length of service, occupation, occupation category, pay grade, salary level, type of appointment, work schedule, agency, and location. Data are published quarterly (March, June, September, and December) for the most recent eight fiscal years. September data, which align with the end of the fiscal year, are available from 1998 to the present. Accession . This set of cubes contains the number of people added to the federal civilian workforce each fiscal year. It includes data elements on employees hired from outside the government and those who transferred from one type of federal service category to another. The most recent 14 fiscal years of data are available. Separation . This set of cubes contains the number of people who leave the federal civilian workforce each fiscal year. It captures data elements on employees who transferred to other agencies, voluntarily resigned, retired, experienced a reduction-in-force (RIF), were terminated, or died while employed. The most recent 14 years of data are available. Employment Trends . This set of cubes displays the most recent five years of employment cube data together in one interface, facilitating workforce data comparisons and trend recognition. Diversity . This set of cubes sorts data by an Ethnicity and Race Indicator. Data elements for 13 categories of racial and ethnic groups are available for the most recent eight years. September data, which align with the end of the fiscal year, are available from 2006 to the present. Table 2 provides some of the most commonly requested data available from FedScope. Employment and Trends is an occasional publication from OPM based on on-board employee data. It provides data on executive departments and independent agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD) civilian employees, Executive Office of the President, legislative branch, and judicial branch. It presents selected data in detailed statistical tables and includes information by government branch, agency, and location. Introductory material in Employment and Trends explains the data presented, time lags in data releases, and caveats to consider when calculating workforce totals.

OMB is the largest component of the Executive Office of the President. OMB reports directly to the President, and it assists executive departments and agencies in implementing priorities and commitments of the President. OMB produces the Budget of the United States , which includes federal employee statistics created using the FTE counting method. The Budget of the United States , sometimes referred to as the President's Budget, is a four-volume set of documents that includes detailed financial information on individual programs and appropriations accounts. Three volumes of the budget include information on direct civilian FTEs. Tables in the President's Budget typically include actual FTE levels for prior fiscal years and estimates for the two most current fiscal years.

{"input": "", "context": "A ccording to Article 1, Section 7, of the Constitution, when the President chooses not to sign a bill and instead returns it to the chamber that originated it, the chamber shall enter the message of the President detailing the reasons for the veto in its Journal and then \"proceed to reconsider\" the bill. A vetoed bill can become law if two-thirds of the Members voting in each chamber agree, by recorded vote, a quorum being present, to repass the bill and thereby override the veto of the President. The chamber that originated the bill sent to the President acts first on the question of its reconsideration. In other words, the House acts first on vetoed bills that carry an \"H.R.\" or \"H.J. Res.\" designation, and the Senate acts first on vetoed bills that carry an \"S.\" or \"S.J. Res.\" designation. If the chamber of origin votes to repass the bill, then the bill with the veto message is transmitted to the second chamber, which then also reconsiders it. Nothing in the Constitution requires that either chamber vote directly on the question of repassing a vetoed bill. The chambers have, for example, referred a vetoed bill to committee instead. If either chamber fails to vote on the question of repassing the bill, then the measure dies at the end of the Congress. Both chambers will not necessarily even have a chance to take up the question. If two-thirds of the Members of the chamber of origin do not agree to override a veto, then the measure dies, and the other chamber does not have an opportunity to vote on the question of repassing the bill. The Constitution does not otherwise address how Congress should consider a vetoed bill, and it is therefore House and Senate rules and practices that additionally govern the treatment of bills vetoed and returned by the President. The consideration of a vetoed bill is a matter of high privilege in the House, and the chamber generally votes to override or sustain the veto shortly after the message is received from the President or the Senate. Time for debate on the question is usually controlled and allocated by members of the committee of jurisdiction, and a majority of the House can vote to bring consideration to a close. To repass the bill over the veto of the President requires the support of two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present. On the day a vetoed bill and accompanying presidential message are received, the Speaker lays the message before the House. The veto message is read and entered in the House Journal . It is not necessary for a Member to make a motion to reconsider the vetoed bill. If no Member seeks recognition after the message is read, the Speaker will put the question of overriding the veto before the House by stating: The pending question is whether the House will, on reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding. If Members do not wish to debate the question immediately, several preferential motions can be made before the Speaker states it. The House can agree by motion (or unanimous consent) to postpone the consideration of a veto message to a named day or to refer it to committee. The motion to postpone consideration of a veto message and the motion to refer a veto message are debatable under the hour rule. The House may also agree to a nondebatable motion to lay the vetoed bill on the table. While the motion to table usually permanently and adversely disposes of a matter, that is not true in the case of a vetoed bill. A motion to remove the bill from the table could be made at any time. Debate on the question of overriding a veto takes place under the hour rule. In practice, the Speaker recognizes the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over the vetoed bill for an hour of debate, and the chair in turn yields 30 minutes to the ranking minority member for purposes of the debate only. The chair and ranking member of the committee serve as floor managers of the debate, yielding portions of time to other Members who wish to speak. Typically, after the hour is consumed or yielded back, the majority floor manager moves the previous question. If a majority of the House votes to order the previous question, the vote immediately occurs on the question of overriding the veto. To override a veto, two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present, must agree to repass the bill over the President's objections. The Constitution requires that the vote be by the \"yeas and nays,\" which in the modern House means that Members' votes will be recorded through the electronic voting system. The vote on the veto override is final because, in contrast to votes on most other questions in the House, a motion to reconsider the vote on the question of overriding a veto is not in order. If the override vote on a House or Senate bill is unsuccessful, then the House informs the Senate of this fact and typically refers the bill and veto message to committee. If the House votes to override a veto of a bill that originated in the House (H.R. or H.J. Res.), the bill and veto message are sent to the Senate for action. If the House successfully overrides a veto of a bill that originated in the Senate (S. or S.J. Res.), then the bill becomes law, because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to override the veto. If the Senate wishes to reconsider a vetoed bill, Senators generally enter into a unanimous consent agreement that the message be considered as read, printed in the Congressional Record , and, as required by the Constitution, entered in the Senate Journal . Senators often also agree, by unanimous consent, to limit time for debate on the question of overriding the veto. When the Senate receives a vetoed measure from the President or the House, it is quite common for it to be \"held at the desk\" for several days and considered only after unanimous consent has been reached on the terms of its consideration. When the vote on the question occurs, it must be taken by roll-call vote and receive support from two-thirds of the Senators voting, a quorum being present. Although generally the Senate reconsiders a vetoed bill under the terms of a unanimous consent agreement, it is not necessary to secure the support of all 100 Senators to consider a vetoed bill in the Senate. Absent an arrangement to hold the veto message at the desk, it would be read and then entered into the Journal after its receipt from the President or the House. The presiding officer would then state: Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding? Several debatable motions are in order, however, that could displace consideration of the veto message. The message could be referred to committee, for example, or postponed to a specific time. Alternatively, the majority leader might make a motion to proceed to another matter. The question of overriding the veto could be brought back before the Senate with the consent of all Senators or by a numerical majority through a nondebatable motion to proceed. Finally, once the veto message has been laid before the Senate, it could also be tabled or indefinitely postponed, which would normally preclude any further action on the matter. The question of overriding a veto is debatable under the regular rules of the Senate. The question could be debated as long as any Senator sought recognition to discuss it. Debate on the question of overriding a veto can be limited by unanimous consent or by invoking cloture. Ending debate through a cloture motion requires the support of three-fifths of Senators duly chosen and sworn, or 60 Senators if there is no more than one vacancy. Cloture is rarely used to end debate on overriding a presidential veto. The number of Senators required to end debate is less than the number required to override a veto (assuming that there are no vacancies and more than 90 Senators vote on the override question). Two-thirds of the Senators voting, a quorum being present, must agree to override the veto and repass the bill. The vote must be a roll-call vote and not a voice vote, due to the constitutional requirement that the vote be by the \"yeas and nays.\" A motion to reconsider the vote on the question of overriding a veto is in order only if the Senate fails to override the veto. In other words, if two-thirds of the Senators agree to override the veto, a motion to reconsider that vote is not in order. If the Senate fails to override a veto of a Senate-originated bill (S. or S.J. Res.), then the question of override never reaches the House. The Senate simply informs the House that the override vote on a House or Senate bill was unsuccessful. If the override vote on a Senate-originated measure (S. or S.J. Res.) is successful in the Senate, the bill and veto message are sent to the House for action. If the override vote on a House-originated measure (H.R. or H.J. Res.) is successful, then the bill becomes law, because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to override the veto.", "answers": ["A bill or joint resolution that has been vetoed by the President can become law if two-thirds of the Members voting in the House and the Senate each agree to pass it over the President's objection.

{"input": "", "context": "The exchanges (including the FFE and those operated by individual states) provide a seamless, single point of access for eligible individuals to enroll in qualified health plans. For the FFE, CMS established a website—Healthcare.gov—as the public portal through which individuals may apply for coverage and select and enroll in health plans, which are offered at different levels of coverage, or “metal tiers”—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—that reflect the percentage of covered medical expenses estimated to be paid by the insurer. The data that individuals provide in their application is stored in the FFE’s centralized enrollment system, which is maintained by CMS. Although CMS oversees the centralized enrollment system, both CMS and issuers have shared responsibility for enrollment and coverage functions once individuals apply for coverage: CMS is responsible for determining an individual’s eligibility for coverage and income-based federal subsidies, enrolling the individual, and processing subsequent coverage changes or terminations. For example, individuals may change their existing coverage by signing up under an SEP due to the birth of a child or relocation, or they may voluntarily terminate their coverage, or CMS may terminate coverage if the agency is unable to verify key information such as citizenship status. CMS is also responsible for making payments for APTCs and determining whether an enrollee is eligible for any cost-sharing reductions that lower enrollees’ out-of- pocket costs for expenses, such as deductibles and copayments. Issuers are responsible for, among other things, collecting premiums from enrollees, arranging for coverage through provider networks, and paying claims. Issuers are also responsible for processing, and notifying CMS of, terminations related to nonpayment of premiums or fraud. As a result of this shared responsibility, CMS and issuers notify each other of coverage updates by transferring data back and forth through electronic files known as “transaction files.” It is critical that both issuers and CMS have consistent, accurate, and current information on enrollees, because monthly APTC payments are based on enrollment data in CMS’s centralized system. Federal regulations require CMS to reconcile enrollment information with issuers on at least a monthly basis. Accordingly, CMS and issuers reconcile certain key data elements on a monthly basis through an automated enrollment reconciliation process, in which issuer and CMS data are compared and discrepancies are resolved. Through this process, APTC amounts and their effective dates are compared and reconciled. CMS’s data system is considered to be correct when considering discrepancies on overall enrollment counts or with key data elements, such as coverage start and end dates between issuer and CMS data. Therefore, CMS will not change the APTC payments based on issuers’ data that may differ from CMS’s data unless there are significant discrepancies. There are several specific steps involved in transferring data between CMS and issuers for initial enrollment, subsequent updates, and reconciliation (see fig. 1 for a high-level overview of the data transfer process): Initial enrollment: CMS forwards an outbound electronic transaction file to the issuer with information on the applicant, the plan selection, the premium, and the APTC amount. Once the issuer receives the initial premium payment, the issuer sends an inbound electronic transaction file back to CMS to confirm the enrollment. Issuers may not refuse to issue coverage to an individual CMS has deemed eligible once that individual has made the initial premium payment. Transaction files are transmitted electronically on a daily basis. Subsequent changes/terminations: Subsequent changes to the individual’s coverage may be initiated by enrollees, CMS, or issuers. For example, enrollees may request changes to their coverage through the portal if they experience a change in circumstance (such as needing to enroll under an SEP due to the birth of a child, or to terminate their coverage if they move to a different state); CMS may terminate coverage if the agency cannot verify key eligibility information (such as citizenship status); or issuers may terminate coverage if enrollees fail to pay their premiums. If CMS initiates changes in coverage, it notifies issuers through subsequent outbound transaction files, and similarly, if issuers initiate changes they notify CMS through subsequent inbound transaction files. Monthly reconciliation: CMS sends issuers a snapshot of key elements of the enrollment data in its centralized enrollment system in an outbound reconciliation file. Issuers compare the data from the file to their enrollment systems and identify missing enrollments or other discrepancies. Issuers make updates as necessary and send CMS an inbound reconciliation file with information about current enrollees, cancellations, and terminations in their systems. CMS then performs an automated comparison of the data in the inbound reconciliation files with its centralized enrollment system and identifies any further discrepancies that may need to be resolved either by CMS or issuers. If necessary, CMS makes further updates to its data. In an April 2017 final rule, CMS implemented several actions that, in part, responded to issuer concerns about special enrollment periods and stability of enrollment. Specifically, CMS stated that the agency would require documentation from all individuals applying to enroll in coverage under an SEP to verify their eligibility for the SEP prior to enrollment. CMS also stated that, starting in June 2017, it would allow issuers, subject to state law, to apply a new premium payment to an individual’s past due payments before applying that premium towards a new enrollment. CMS stated that issuers would be allowed to refuse to provide coverage to an enrollee applying under an SEP due to loss of existing coverage if the issuer had previously terminated the enrollee’s coverage for nonpayment of premiums, unless the enrollee paid the past due premiums. CMS further stated that this provision was intended to encourage individuals to maintain continuous coverage rather than start and stop coverage (and thereby avoid incurring past due premiums). Approximately 4.9 million enrollees (53 percent of the 9.2 million FFE enrollees in 2015) maintained continuous coverage throughout the year— that is, their coverage began between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and lasted through December 31, 2015. These individuals therefore had 10 or more months of continuous coverage, with an average length of coverage of 11.6 months. Most of these enrollees (83 percent) re-enrolled in coverage by June 2016. The remaining 4.3 million enrollees (47 percent of the FFE enrollees in 2015) did not maintain continuous FFE coverage throughout the year, as defined above. The average length of coverage for these enrollees was about 5.0 months and, for most (72 percent), coverage ended prior to the end of the year. (See fig. 2 for information on enrollee length of coverage.) Of the 4.3 million enrollees, 38 percent re-enrolled in exchange coverage for 2016, although enrollees that held coverage through the end of the year—regardless of their length of coverage—were far more likely to have re-enrolled than enrollees whose coverage ended prior to the year’s end. In general, we did not find notable differences in attributes of enrollees’ coverage (for example, by benefit level of selected plan or monthly premium after APTC) or enrollee demographics when comparing the two groups of enrollees—those who maintained continuous coverage throughout 2015, and those who did not. (For data on coverage and demographics of FFE enrollees who did maintain continuous coverage throughout 2015 and those who did not, see app. I.) However, in examining the demographic and coverage characteristics of all FFE enrollees, we found that enrollees with certain characteristics tended to remain covered for a longer period of time in 2015 compared to other enrollees. For example: Enrollment period. Enrollees who enrolled during the open enrollment period had a higher average length of coverage than enrollees who enrolled through an SEP—9.1 months compared to 5.2 months (see fig. 3). However, more individuals who enrolled through an SEP remained enrolled through December 31, 2015, compared to individuals who enrolled during open enrollment—72 percent compared to 64 percent. Age. Enrollees aged 55 or older had the highest average length of coverage, while those aged 25 to 34 had the lowest—9.2 months compared to 7.8 months. Reported household income. APTC-eligible enrollees who reported having a household income between 301 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level had the highest average length of coverage, while those who reported having a household income less than, or equal to, 100 percent of the federal poverty level had the lowest—8.9 months compared to 8.0 months. Eligibility for APTC. Enrollees who were eligible for APTC had a higher average length of coverage than enrollees who were not eligible for APTC—8.6 months compared to 7.8 months Benefit level of selected plan. Enrollees who selected higher- benefit, gold plans had the highest average length of coverage, while enrollees who selected lower-benefit catastrophic, plans had the lowest—8.8 months compared to 6.7 months. Enrollees who selected silver plans—the most common plan selection—had an average length of coverage of 8.6 months. State of residence. Enrollees residing in Maine had the highest average length of coverage, while enrollees residing in Mississippi had the lowest—9.4 months compared to 8.0 months. See appendix II for additional data on the average length of coverage for enrollees by various characteristics. CMS’s data on terminations of enrollee coverage due to nonpayment of premiums are not complete and accurate. CMS officials told us that they collect some information from issuers on their terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. When issuers terminate policies, the inbound transaction files they send to CMS must include, among other elements, a revised coverage end date taking the termination into account. CMS uploads these data into its centralized FFE enrollment system. However, while the issuers may also include codes that designate the reasons for the terminations, there is no requirement for them to consistently do so. Data on termination codes may therefore not be consistently reported by issuers. CMS officials told us that data on reasons for termination are not tracked because they are not critical to ensure the accuracy of APTC payments—which is the main function of the reconciliation process. Officials stated that key essential variables that CMS does track are whether coverage is effectuated (that is, whether the first premium payment has been made), whether the enrollee is eligible for APTC payments, and whether coverage was terminated. In addition, when issuers do report termination reason codes, these data are not always accurate. Specifically, CMS told us that, historically, issuers may have incorrectly used the nonpayment termination code for other types of terminations, and two issuers we interviewed acknowledged having done so. We compared data on terminations for nonpayment from CMS’s centralized enrollment system with data we obtained from three issuers for a small selection of enrollees. We found that for one large issuer operating in multiple states, the CMS data indicated that coverage for 18 of the 26 enrollees that we examined had been terminated for nonpayment of premiums, while the issuer data indicated that coverage had been terminated for other reasons, in most cases because it had expired at the end of the year. The issuer indicated that it likely reported these year-end terminations to CMS incorrectly as terminations for nonpayment of premiums. CMS has recently taken actions that may improve the reliability of data on terminations for nonpayment, but these actions do not ensure the data are consistently reported and recorded by CMS. Specifically, in July 2017, CMS indicated that it would add new codes to the transaction files for issuers to use to help prevent inaccurate reporting of the nonpayment termination code. CMS told us that it expects issuers to begin using the new codes in 2018. CMS’s data on terminations for nonpayment therefore may be more reliable beginning in 2018. However, CMS has not required issuers to report the termination reasons in the transaction files because, according to CMS officials, these data are not essential to tracking the accuracy of APTC payments. The agency also does not have plans in the near future to use the data in tracking trends in enrollment and termination of enrollee coverage in the FFE to assess the overall stability of the exchange. Further, CMS does not have a transparent, systematic process for issuers to ensure that data on terminations they initiate due to nonpayment are complete and accurate in the CMS system. Issuers we interviewed told us that they are unable to ascertain whether CMS is correctly updating the FFE enrollment system with the termination reason codes issuers provide when policies are terminated. While issuers can determine from the monthly reconciliation files whether CMS has updated certain issuer data for enrollees whose coverage was terminated (for example, the revised coverage end date), the files do not capture data on reasons for termination. Therefore, issuers are unable to determine if the CMS FFE data on termination reason codes matches theirs and make corrections where necessary. Some issuers told us they had requested that CMS add a variable to capture data on termination reasons in the monthly reconciliation files sent to issuers. CMS officials stated that the agency is in the initial stages of exploring whether this would be feasible for CMS and issuers, but that it will require significant resources and time to develop. Although CMS’s recent changes may improve its data, they do not ensure the agency will have complete and transparent data on terminations for nonpayment of premiums. According to federal internal control standards, federal agencies should obtain and use relevant, reliable data to achieve their objectives. Without complete and accurate data, CMS may be allowing enrollees who lost exchange coverage for nonpayment of premiums to re-enroll under SEPs although, under federal regulations, these individuals are ineligible to do so. Issuers reported that this had occurred. CMS officials told us that the agency is exploring options to have its system automatically prevent certain enrollees with prior terminations for nonpayment from enrolling in coverage under an SEP for loss of existing coverage, but noted that this functionality would depend on receiving reliable data on terminations for nonpayment from issuers. Further, without reliable data, CMS may not be able to assess the effects of its April 2017 policy allowing issuers to apply enrollees’ new premium payments toward unpaid premiums over the past 12 months. This is because the agency lacks the complete and accurate data that would be necessary to ensure that issuers are correctly identifying enrollees terminated for nonpayment. In its role as administrator of the FFE, it is important for CMS to assess the overall stability of the exchange by, among other things, tracking trends in enrollment and termination of enrollee coverage and addressing issuers’ concerns, where appropriate, to ensure their continued participation in the exchange. Issuers have raised concerns that the SEP regulations potentially allow individuals to enroll in coverage despite having their coverage terminated for nonpayment of premiums. However, CMS does not have the data needed to determine the extent of these problems. While CMS has made some efforts to improve the accuracy of the agency’s data on terminations for nonpayment, it has not indicated whether the agency will require issuers to consistently and accurately report these data. Moreover, CMS has no way to ensure the reliability and transparency of the data, because the existing process—the exchange of monthly reconciliation files between CMS and issuers—does not have a place to capture these data. CMS could capitalize on this existing process, already familiar to issuers, by adding a variable that captures data on termination reasons to the monthly reconciliation file and tracking its accuracy. By taking this step, in addition to requiring issuers to report these data, CMS could help ensure it has reliable and transparent data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums, and it could use these data to assess the effects of CMS policies and the overall stability of the exchange. We are making the following two recommendations to CMS: The Administrator of CMS should ensure that CMS has complete data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums by requiring issuers to report these data. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of CMS should provide a transparent process for issuers and CMS to systematically reconcile discrepancies in their data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to HHS. HHS provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendix III. HHS concurred with our first recommendation to require issuers to report data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. HHS noted that it currently collects information on termination reasons on enrollment transactions with issuers, and that it would review the requirements for collection of these data to identify possible improvements. HHS also concurred with our second recommendation to ensure a transparent process for issuers and CMS to systematically reconcile discrepancies in their data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. HHS stated that it would consider how to incorporate reconciliation of these data into its existing monthly data reconciliation process with issuers, balancing issuer and agency burdens against the benefits of doing so.

Certain rules allow for enrollment flexibilities—such as special enrollment periods and a 3-month grace period that is allowed before coverage is terminated for recipients of federal income-based subsidies who default on their premiums. However, some issuers have stated that these rules could be misused, resulting in non-continuous coverage. There are little data on the extent to which enrollees maintain continuous coverage during a year and, more specifically, on the extent to which coverage is terminated for nonpayment of premiums. GAO examined (1) the extent to which FFE enrollees maintained coverage in 2015 and (2) the extent to which CMS has reliable data on termination of enrollees' coverage for nonpayment of premiums. GAO analyzed CMS's 2015 FFE enrollment data (the most recent year of available data); interviewed CMS officials and selected issuers; and reviewed applicable laws and guidance from CMS. In 2015, 9.2 million individuals enrolled in the federal health insurance exchange in 37 states. Eligible individuals (e.g., U.S. citizens or those lawfully present in the United States) are able to enroll in health coverage during the annual open enrollment period. Outside of open enrollment, eligible individuals may enroll in coverage or change their coverage selection during special enrollment periods. Individuals may enroll under a special enrollment period if, for example, they lost their coverage from another source, such as Medicaid or an employer, or due to relocation. Under federal regulations, enrollees may not sign up for coverage under a special enrollment period citing loss of coverage if the coverage was lost due to nonpayment of premiums. About half (53 percent) of the 2015 federally facilitated exchange (FFE) enrollees maintained continuous health insurance coverage throughout the year—that is, they began coverage between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and maintained it through December 31, 2015. These individuals had an average of 11.6 months of coverage. The remaining 47 percent of FFE enrollees started their coverage later or ended it during the year; they averaged 5.0 months of coverage. Enrollees could have voluntarily ended coverage—due to gaining other coverage, for example—or have had it terminated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or the issuers of coverage for valid reasons, including losing eligibility for exchange coverage or for nonpayment of premiums. CMS does not have reliable data on issuer-generated terminations of coverage for enrollees' nonpayment of premiums. Although CMS and issuers share data on the terminations each generates and reconcile their data on a monthly basis to ensure data accuracy, the agency does not require issuers to consistently report data on the reasons for terminations. Officials told us they do not track these data because they are not critical to ensure the accuracy of the federal subsidy amounts—which is the main function of the monthly reconciliation process. Further, CMS lacks a transparent process to ensure the accuracy of these data, as the monthly reconciliation files transmitted between CMS and issuers do not include a place to capture data on termination reasons. Issuers said that they are therefore unable to ascertain whether data they provide on the reasons for termination match CMS's data, and thus they cannot make corrections where necessary. The agency's lack of reliable data on terminations for nonpayment limits its ability to effectively oversee certain federal regulations. For example, because CMS is not systematically tracking these data, it cannot tell whether enrollees applying for coverage under a special enrollment period had lost their coverage for nonpayment of premiums—in which case they would be ineligible for the special enrollment period per federal regulations. CMS could capitalize on its existing process, already familiar to issuers, by adding a variable that captures data on termination reasons to the monthly reconciliation file. By taking this step, in addition to requiring issuers to report these data, CMS could help ensure it has reliable and transparent data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums, and it could use these data to assess the effects of CMS policies and the overall stability of the exchange.

{"input": "", "context": "The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area of the coterminous United States (see Figure 1 ). Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205 ; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by federal dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), selling their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury on schedule for the portion of federal facility costs that have been allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress. Each PMA also has unique elements and regional issues that affect its business. They are discussed in alphabetical order. Created by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 (16 U.S.C. §832) just before the completion of two large dams in the Pacific Northwest—Bonneville Dam in 1938 and Grand Coulee Dam in 1941—BPA was the first PMA. Though it serves a smaller geographical area, BPA is on par with WAPA (which serves the largest area) in the size of its transmission system. The agency operates and maintains about 75% of the high voltage transmission lines in its service territory, which includes Idaho, Oregon, Washington, western Montana and small parts of eastern Montana, California, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. BPA also markets wholesale electricity from 31 federally owned hydropower facilities in the Northwest. These generation facilities are owned both by the Corps and BOR. BPA differs from the other three PMAs in that it is self-financed: it receives no federal appropriations. Since passage of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. §838), BPA has covered its operating costs through power rates set to ensure repayment to the Treasury of capital and interest on funds used to construct the Columbia River power system. BPA also has permanent Treasury borrowing authority, which it may use for capital on large projects. This money is repaid with interest, through power sales. As of 2018, BPA had $5.53 billion of bonds outstanding to the U.S. Treasury, with BPA's current borrowing authority capped by Congress at $7.70 billion. BPA has also looked at other financing options as it approaches its debt limit, looking at nonfederal debt refinancing, lease-purchases, and other asset management strategies. BPA has initiated strategies and a financial plan to address a changing power generation and demand market, as it endeavors to meet its mandate for cost-based electric power rates. These plans are outlined in its Strategic Plan for 2018 to 2023, and address goals from financial health to infrastructure modernization. Wholesale power prices in the United States are generally trending downward, while BPA's firm power rates have trended upward. BPA repays its funding from the U.S. Treasury largely through electricity sales to customers. While BPA generates its electricity from hydropower (which is traditionally one of the lower-cost means of power generation), increasing amounts of renewable electricity from growing wind and solar capacity installations in the Pacific Northwest are challenging BPA's price competitiveness, and perhaps its ability to repay its debts in a timely manner. In 2014, BPA entered into the Regional Cooperation Agreement (RCA) with the State of Washington to address the debt of Energy Northwest, a \"joint action agency formed by the Washington state legislature in 1957\" to manage public power utility costs. Energy Northwest owns and operates four electric power generation facilities: White Bluffs Solar Station, Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project, Nine Canyon Wind Project, and the Columbia Generating Station. The Regional Cooperation debt is \"the issuance of new bonds by Energy Northwest to refund outstanding bonds shortly before their maturities when substantial principal repayments were and are due.\" According to BPA, this allows for \"integrated debt management\" for the combined total debt portfolios of BPA and Energy Northwest, with a net effect reducing the \"weighted average interest rate and the maturity of BPA's overall debt portfolio\" over the life of the program. This refinancing, according to BPA, has enabled BPA to prepay higher-interest-rate federal obligations, and has \"preserved or restored U.S. Treasury borrowing authority.\" However, the debt service of the RCA is \"borne by BPA ratepayers through BPA rates.\" BPA estimates that the \"aggregate potential principal amount\" of RCA refunding through bonds issued in fiscal years 2019 through 2030 could exceed $4.0 billion. BPA is responsible for maintaining and modernizing the generation and transmission infrastructure of its systems, and preserving and enhancing its physical and cybersecurity. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) in the West, BPA is considering whether to join the EIM, and how this might affect its operations and customers. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., operations consistent with the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. In addition, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit blaming the dams for warm river waters in summer 2015 that resulted in the deaths of about 250,000 adult sockeye salmon migrating up the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Some of these parties have sought to remove the four lower dams on the Snake River to ensure survival of some salmon and steelhead species. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. The memorandum ordered the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce \"to appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind any regulations or procedures that unduly burden\" water infrastructure projects so they \"are better able to meet the demands of their authorized purposes.\" How this will affect the fish endangerment finding is unclear at this time. The Southeastern Power Administration was created in 1950 by the Secretary of the Interior to carry out the functions assigned to the Secretary by the Flood Control Act of 1944 (P.L. 78-534) in 11 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia). SEPA is unique among the four PMAs in two ways. It is the smallest PMA, with just over 40 employees, and, unlike the other three agencies, SEPA does not operate or maintain any transmission facilities, and thus contracts with other utilities for transmitting the federal power it markets to more than 12 million consumers. Southeastern markets approximately 3,400 MW of power produced at 22 multipurpose water projects, operated and maintained by the Corps. SEPA's facilities are aging; for instance, in 2018 it reported that its Cumberland System customers have agreed to fund $1.2 billion of planned rehabilitations of the nine hydroelectric facilities in the Corps' Nashville District. According to SEPA, it has an overcapacity issue. Projections for electricity load growth (in consultation with its preference customers) made before the 2008 economic downturn reportedly led to SEPA acquiring additional capacity it currently does not use. As a result, municipalities and electric cooperatives in SEPA's service area will have to make economic decisions regarding how to handle this excess capacity. As of 2018, at least one preference customer has terminated its contract with SEPA due to this issue. Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 (P.L. 78-534) established the Southwestern Power Administration. SWPA markets hydroelectric power in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas from 24 multipurpose Corps dams with a combined capacity of 2,194 MW. SWPA serves more than 100 preference customer utilities with more than 8 million end-use customers. The agency manages nearly 1,400 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. SWPA is the only U.S. electrical balancing area supported solely by hydroelectric generation, and its use of the reservoirs and river systems within the SWPA marketing area must be balanced with flood control and other required uses so that the power needs of its customers can be met. SWPA states that it uses alternative financing and offsetting collection authorities to fund expenses and purchase power to help SWPA meet its obligations while minimizing congressional appropriations. Periodically, SWPA has been challenged by low water conditions. It has a rain-based water supply—rather than one that is snow-based, like the mountain snowpack water supply of WAPA and BPA—and sells power from a comparatively small reservoir system which stores that water. Extended dry periods sometimes mean that SWPA must purchase replacement power and energy to meet its contractual obligations. This means that SWPA requires congressional authority to use its revenues from power sales over the long term—across high and low water years. Prior year balances have been available to Southwestern so that we are financially prepared and able to achieve rate stability for our customers. This authority is critical to operating our program according to sound business principles. Southwestern's program is funded by authority to use receipts, alternative financing, and other authorities approved by Congress, including appropriations, which represent only 6.5% of Southwestern's total program. Created by the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-91 ), WAPA is the newest and largest of the PMAs in terms of service area. WAPA's service area covers 1.3 million square miles, and its power—transmitted by a high voltage grid over 17,000 miles long—serves customers in 15 western states. WAPA markets and transmits hydropower from 56 federal dams operated by BOR, and the Corps. It also sells hydropower power produced by facilities administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission, and markets the United States' 24.3% share (547 megawatts) of the coal-fired Navajo Generating Station in Arizona. In addition to the types of public bodies traditionally served as preference customers by the other PMAs, WAPA has developed a policy to give preference to Native American tribes regardless of their utility status. WAPA has been working with other regional entities to address the changing electric power needs of its customers. In 2014, WAPA published its Strategic Roadmap 2024, titled \"Powering the Energy Frontier.\" The document is intended to serve as WAPA's strategic plan to guide the agency's actions for the next 10 years. However, according to some, the developing Energy Imbalance Market in the West may provide additional options for WAPA to address transmission development needs to balance regional generation and demand. An issue of continuing importance to WAPA is its role in relieving transmission congestion within its marketing area. There are a number of constrained transmission paths in the West whose limited capacity to transfer power may reduce the ability of utilities to serve electric loads on a seasonal or ongoing basis. In 2009, Section 402 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 111-5 ) amended the Hoover Power Plant Act of 1984 to give WAPA authority to borrow up to $3.25 billion from the U.S. Treasury to pursue transmission projects that integrate renewable generation sources into the electric transmission grid. The law provides authority to construct and upgrade transmission lines to help deliver renewable resources to market. Western created the Transmission Infrastructure Program, also known as TIP, to implement this new initiative. Several transmission projects have been initiated under the program. Previous budget proposals and legislation have proposed repealing WAPA's loan authority, but to date, none of these proposals have been enacted. In 2015, WAPA's Upper Great Plains (UGP) region joined the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). Under the operating agreement with SPP, WAPA was required to transfer functional control of UGP's eligible transmission facilities to SPP. WAPA is the first PMA to formally join an RTO, and states that benefits to date from joining SPP have significantly exceeded the original estimate of $11.5 million per year. WAPA reports that two of its other regions are considering joining SPP. For Water Year 2017, WAPA reported that it delivered 26,148 gigawatt-hours of hydroelectric power to its customers, which is 101% of average annual power sales. The West has been experiencing periodic droughts for a number of years, resulting in lower snowmelts and less water in storage and available for power generation. To help smooth the resulting annual differences, a \"drought-adder\" reduction program has been implemented in recent years. A drought-adder charge was levied to help repay deferred drought costs accrued during the 2000s in the Rocky Mountain and Upper Great Plains regions. The balance was paid a year ahead of schedule and, as of this year, has resulted in $40 million annual savings for more than 50 percent of WAPA's customers in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas and the western sections of Minnesota and Iowa. This is the second year that 417 of WAPA's customers, out of 700, have had a rate reduction. The drought-adder component of the rate remains available to WAPA to adjust to the variable hydropower resource—a lasting risk if drought conditions persist in WAPA's territory. Moderate to extreme drought conditions have been reported in parts of the western United States. In addition to issues specific to individual PMAs, some recent proposals have applied to multiple PMAs. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets and increasing the private sector role would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The proposal calls for federal transmission infrastructure assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) to be sold, with the private sector and/or state and local entities potentially taking over the transmission functions now provided by the PMAs. The Federal entities that would result after such sales could contract with other utilities to provide transmission service for the delivery of Federal power just as the Southeastern Power Administration, which does not own transmission lines, already does. The proposal reports that according to the Administration's FY2019 budget justification, the sale of federal transmission assets would result in a net budgetary savings of $9.5 billion, in total, over a 10-year window. Reportedly, the Administration dropped the plan due to stakeholder opposition, with the Department of Energy stating that such a sale of PMA transmission assets would not proceed unless directed by Congress. Proposals to sell all or part of the PMAs are not new, and have been made in some form by almost every President since Reagan. However, Congress has sought to prevent executive branch alterations of PMA structures and authority. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 ( P.L. 99-349 ), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. The Trump Administration divestment proposal could have had an indirect impact on the original congressional intent for the PMAs to provide electricity at the lowest possible cost. This in turn could require changes to the following provisions: Flood Control Act of 1944, as amended (FCA; 16 U.S.C. §825s et seq. ); The 1937 Bonneville Project Act (BPA; 16 U.S.C. §832c ); and The Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (RPA; 43 U.S.C. §485h(c)) . These laws also stipulate a preference of public bodies for the sale of federal power. Selling federally owned transmission assets could potentially affect the \"lowest possible\" rates of sale, and the statutory preference for publicly or cooperatively owned utilities to be the vehicle for sale of electric power produced by federal facilities.", "answers": ["The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies.

{"input": "", "context": "The right to bail in noncapital cases has firm roots in the United States, dating back to colonial times and originating in English law. As the Supreme Court recognized, the \"traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense and prevents inflicting punishment prior to conviction.\" But the Supreme Court has never recognized a right to bail as absolute, and has held that the government may have legitimate interests in limiting the availability of bail, even for noncapital crimes, based not only on possible flight risk but also on other considerations, including the danger an arrestee poses to public safety or specific members of the community. Nonetheless, the Court has also observed that pretrial detention may have negative consequences for criminal defendants, such as by impairing their ability to maintain employment and to support dependents financially. The impact of state and municipal money-bail systems on indigent criminal defendants has prompted legislative interest in, and judicial challenges to, such systems. Money-bail systems allow defendants to avoid jail while awaiting trial by posting a bond according to a fee schedule. Typically, judges do not assess a detainee's individual characteristics beyond the offense charged; instead, judges set a defendant's bail based on the criminal offense with which he is charged. Defendants who cannot pay bail may remain detained pending trial. Money-bail systems differ from the federal bail system, which gives judicial officers greater discretion over the conditions of a defendant's pretrial release. Federal law also expressly provides that a \"judicial officer may not impose a financial condition that results in the pretrial detention of the person.\" Critics of state and local money-bail systems assert, among other things, that fee schedules unduly burden indigent defendants, who face more difficulty paying bail—including relatively low bail fees associated with misdemeanor offenses—than nonindigent defendants accused of similar offenses. Supporters, on the other hand, contend that fee schedules help guarantee a defendant's appearance in subsequent proceedings and treat defendants uniformly. In recent years, a few jurisdictions, including New Mexico, Kentucky, New Jersey, Colorado, and Maryland, have considered legislative proposals or ballot initiatives to eliminate or alter their money-bail systems. Some states, including California, Colorado, and New Jersey, altered their money-bail systems to employ more individualized risk assessment tools rather than using the nature of the offense charged. Recently, defendants have challenged various state or municipal bail systems as inconsistent with the Constitution's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. For example, in Jones v. City of Clanton (formerly Varden v. City of Clanton ), the parties settled the case by making release on an unsecured bond the norm rather than the exception. Lawsuits in a few other local jurisdictions have similarly been settled. In Pierce v. City of Velda City , the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri issued a declaratory judgment stating that \"no person may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, be held in custody after an arrest because the person is too poor to post a monetary bond.\" Subsequently, the parties entered a settlement agreement on a new bail policy. During the latter years of the Obama Administration, the Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest in litigation challenging the constitutionality of local bail systems. The DOJ filed an amicus brief in a civil rights lawsuit challenging bail amounts based solely on the offense, calling such systems unconstitutional because of their impact upon indigent defendants. As of the date of this report, it is unclear whether the DOJ and the Trump Administration will continue to take an active role in this case. Money-bail is only one way states and municipalities provide for pretrial release. Absent clear statutory guidance, judges enjoy broad discretion to determine appropriate conditions for releasing a criminal defendant pending trial. When considering pretrial release, judges weigh several factors such as due process, securing a defendant's subsequent court appearance, and protecting society from the defendant. Judges may use various forms of pretrial release such as personal recognizance, secured or unsecured bonds, or conditional release. Historically, judges have denied defendants bail if they pose a flight risk upon release. For example, judges generally presume defendants charged with capital crimes pose a flight risk. The Supreme Court has recognized that the government may have other, constitutionally legitimate grounds for limiting pretrial release of defendants, including danger to public safety. Several state statutory and constitutional provisions deny bail to defendants arrested for capital crimes \"where the proof is evident or the presumption is great,\" and a few also limit bail for noncapital offenses with certain characteristics. Some of these latter restrictions have been challenged legally. In contrast, federal law creates a rebuttable presumption that favors (but does not compel) detention of persons charged with certain offenses when a judge or magistrate determines, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant has a prior conviction for an offense included in one of nine categories of detention-qualifying offenses (crimes of violence, etc.), committed while the accused was free on pretrial release and for which the accused was convicted or released from prison within the last five years. Federal law also establishes a second rebuttable presumption of detention in favor of pretrial detention when the judge or magistrate finds probable cause to believe that the accused has committed a 10-year controlled substance offense, federal crime of terrorism offense, or various kidnapping or sexual offenses committed against a child. The Constitution governs pretrial detention and bail. For money-bail systems, particularly as they apply to indigent defendants, the key provisions are the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Bail Clause and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states that \"[e]xcessive bail shall not be required.\" Bail is excessive when \"set higher than an amount that is reasonably likely to ensure the defendant's presence at the trial.\" While the Eighth Amendment expressly prohibits excessive bail, it does not establish an absolute right to bail. Whether an accused has a right to bail depends on how expansively a court interprets the provision. For example, in Stack v. Boyle , the Court declared that \"this traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense, and serves to prevent the infliction of punishment prior to conviction.... Unless this right to bail before trial is preserved, the presumption of innocence, secured only after centuries of struggle, would lose its meaning.\" However, in Carlson v. Landon , decided in the same term as Stack , the Court stated the following: The bail clause was lifted, with slight changes, from the English Bill of Rights Act. In England, that clause has never been thought to accord a right to bail in all cases, but merely to provide that bail shall not be excessive in those cases where it is proper to grant bail. When this clause was carried over into our Bill of Rights, nothing was said that indicated any different concept. The Eighth Amendment has not prevented Congress from defining the classes of cases in which bail shall be allowed in this country. Thus, in criminal cases, bail is not compulsory where the punishment may be death. Indeed, the very language of the Amendment fails to say all arrests must be bailable. Similarly, in United States v. Salerno (Salerno ), the Court found the federal Bail Reform Act to be constitutionally valid under the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Bail Clause. The Bail Reform Act allowed judges to detain individuals in certain limited circumstances when the accused poses a danger to the public at large or to particular members of the public. In upholding the act, the Court noted that the Excessive Bail Clause does not limit congressional considerations to question of flight. In other words, the clause permits the government pursuing compelling interests such as public safety \"though regulation of pre-trial release.\" In addition to Eighth Amendment considerations, pretrial detention and bail must comport with due process principles. Due process requires that statutes imposing pretrial detention serve a compelling governmental interest and do not impose punishment before adjudication of guilt. Moreover, governmental action that deprives an individual of life, liberty, or property must be implemented in a fair, nonarbitrary manner. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained in the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment applies to actions taken by the federal government, whereas the Fourteenth Amendment applies to actions taken by state governments. Each clause provides that the government shall not deprive a person of \"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" Due process may be procedural or substantive. Based on the principle of \"fundamental fairness,\" procedural due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before a neutral party. Substantive due process \"forbids the government to infringe certain 'fundamental' liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\" In Salerno , the Court found that the Bail Reform Act's regulatory character met substantive and procedural due process requirements. Discussing substantive due process, the Court stated the following: Unless Congress expressly intended to impose punitive restrictions, the punitive/regulatory distinction turns on whether an alternative purpose to which the restriction may rationally be connected is assignable for it and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned to it. We conclude that the detention imposed by the Act falls on the regulatory side of the dichotomy. The legislative history ... indicates that Congress did not formulate the pretrial detention provisions as a punishment for dangerous individuals. Congress instead perceived pretrial detention as a potential solution to a pressing societal problem. There is no doubt that preventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal, nor are the incidents of pretrial detention excessive in relation to the regulatory goal Congress sought to achieve. As for procedural due process, the Court found that the act's tailored procedural safeguards satisfied the Constitution. Under the Constitution's equal protection provisions, courts reviewing government action that distinguishes between classes of people apply different levels of scrutiny depending on the classification used. For example, the Supreme Court has held that governmental action that categorizes people based on certain \"suspect\" classifications, such as race, is subject to strict scrutiny, which is the most searching form of judicial review; other classifications, such as those based on age, are permissible if the statute's use of such classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The Supreme Court has invalidated statutes that impose jail or other adverse consequences based on a defendant's indigence, but it has never held that money-bail systems are constitutionally invalid because indigent defendants have greater difficulty paying bail than other criminal defendants. The Supreme Court, however, has considered the constitutional implications of indigence for criminal defendants in other contexts. In a series of cases, the Court held that imprisonment solely because of indigence constitutes invidious discrimination and is constitutionally impermissible. For example, in Bearden v. United States , the Court held that a court could not automatically revoke a defendant's probation for failing to pay a fine and make restitution unless such nonpayment was willful. After the defendant pleaded guilty to burglary and theft by receiving stolen property, the court sentenced him to three years' probation, a $500 fine, and restitution of $250 to be repaid according to a four-month schedule. After the defendant lost his job and could not make the payments, the court revoked his probation, sentencing him to serve the rest of his sentence. In determining the revocation's constitutionality, the Court analogized the equal protection concerns to the fundamental fairness issues of due process analysis and weighed factors including the \"nature of the individual interest affected, the extent to which it is affected, the rationality of the connection between legislative means and purpose, [and] the existence of alternative means for effectuating the purpose ....\" Acknowledging the state's interest in punishment and deterrence, the Court opined that this could be achieved by extending the repayment period or by the defendant performing public service. The Court held that a court must determine whether nonpayment was willful before revoking a defendant's probation. As the lower court had not made such a finding, the Supreme Court held that \"fundamental fairness requires that the petitioner remain on probation\" and remanded the case. In other cases, the Supreme Court has not recognized indigence as a suspect class warranting strict scrutiny analysis. For example, in Ma h er v. Roe , the Court held the following: An indigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within the limited category of disadvantaged classes so recognized by our cases. Nor does the fact that the impact of the regulation falls upon those who cannot pay lead to a different conclusion. In a sense, every denial of welfare to an indigent creates a wealth classification as compared to nonindigents who are able to pay for the desired goods or services. Accordingly, when weighing the constitutionality of bail statutes, some lower courts have used the rational basis standard to examine whether a bond requirement would rationally and reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance at trial or serve another legitimate government interest. While the Supreme Court has recognized rights for indigents in the sentencing and postconviction contexts, it has not addressed such rights in the bail context. Some courts have viewed claims of excessive bail premised solely on indigence to be uncompelling. For example, in Katona v. City of Cheyenne , a Wyoming federal district court rejected an arrestee's assertion that $35 was excessive bail due to his indigence. Noting that excessive or denial of bail may trigger equal protection concerns, the court applied a rational basis standard of review, examining whether the bond requirement was \"rationally and reasonably\" related to nonresidents appearing at trial. Similarly, in Walker v. City of Calhoun , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated a preliminary injunction against the City of Calhoun's money-bail system for misdemeanor offenders. Arrested and charged with \"being a pedestrian under the influence of alcohol,\" Mr. Walker spent six nights in jail because he could not afford the $160 cash bond set by the money-bail schedule. He filed a class action lawsuit alleging that the City of Calhoun violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by jailing him and other class members \"because of their inability to pay a generically set amount of money to secure release after an arrest.\" The district court found that the bail schedule \"violate[d] the Constitution insofar as it permits individuals who have sufficient resources to post a bond (or to have one posted for them) to be released immediately, while individuals who do not have those resources must wait forty-eight hours for a hearing.\" Appealing to the Eleventh Circuit, the city defended its bail system as constitutional because it discriminated on the seriousness of the offense rather than on wealth. The city argued that the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide \"an absolute entitlement to pretrial release\" and that wealth-based distinctions are subject to rational basis review because wealth is not a suspect class. The city asserted that its bail system met the rational basis standard because it serves the \"legitimate goal of assuring the presence of a defendant at trial.\" The Eleventh Circuit found that the district court erred in applying heightened scrutiny to wealth-based classifications. Citing the Supreme Court's San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez decision, the Eleventh Circuit noted that whether the plaintiff suffered \"an absolute deprivation\" or a \"mere diminishment\" was key because \"differential treatment by wealth is impermissible only where it results in a total deprivation of a benefit because of poverty.\" Because Mr. Walker was not totally deprived of pretrial release but had to wait 48 hours at most to \"receive the same benefit as the more affluent,\" the Eleventh Circuit held that the \"district court was wrong to apply heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.\" Other courts have held that bail systems that incarcerate indigent individuals without considering their ability to pay are unconstitutional. In Pierce v. City of Velda City , the district court issued a declaratory judgment, stating that \"no person may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, be held in custody after an arrest because the person is too poor to post a monetary bond.\" Ultimately, the parties resolved the case through a settlement agreement that changed the jurisdiction's bail system. Recognizing that \"[t]here can be no equal justice where the trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has,\" the Supreme Court has invalidated statutes or actions that arguably punished individuals for indigence. But the Supreme Court has generally viewed pretrial release of criminal defendants to be a regulatory, rather than a penal, matter, noting that the government may have legitimate and, in some cases, compelling interests in limiting pretrial release for certain types of defendants. The Supreme Court has never squarely assessed whether applying money-bail systems to indigent criminal defendants as a class is permissible. Lower courts are split on whether money-bail systems impermissibly discriminate against indigents. Some courts have found money-bail systems to be constitutionally suspect, while others have upheld money-bail systems as rationally related to legitimate or compelling governmental interests, including providing for a defendant's subsequent court appearance.", "answers": ["Money-bail systems allow criminal defendants to avoid prison while awaiting trial by posting a bond set by a fee schedule. The impact of money-bail systems on indigent criminal defendants, however, has prompted legislative interest in and legal challenges to such systems, particularly when the bail does not reflect an individual's specific circumstances, such as potential flight risk or public safety. Critics of money-bail systems assert that fee schedules unduly burden indigent defendants, while supporters argue that fee schedules provide uniformity and ensure that defendants appear at trial. Several states and municipalities have reformed their bail systems. Voters in New Mexico approved a constitutional amendment that allows judges to deny bail to defendants considered exceptionally dangerous, but otherwise permits pretrial release of nondangerous indigent offenders who cannot make bail. Other jurisdictions have altered or eliminated their money-bail systems in recent years, including cities in Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland. Courts have heard legal challenges regarding whether state or local money-bail systems comport with the Constitution's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Supreme Court has established that the Constitution provides certain protections to indigents during sentencing and postconviction, including ensuring that an indigent's failure to pay a fine cannot result in an automatic revocation of probation or imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum term. The Court, however, has not addressed these rights in the bail context. Applying the rational basis standard, some courts have found money-bail systems that reasonably ensure a defendant's subsequent court appearance to be constitutional. Other courts have indicated that bail systems that detain indigent criminal defendants pretrial, without considering their ability to pay, may be unconstitutional."], "length": 3162, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2a4ae3cc469d7961253601a36bfddf890f8f57643e7dceae"}
{"input": "", "context": "Essentially all of the outstanding debt of the federal government is subject to a statutory limit, which is set forth as a dollar limitation in 31 U.S.C. 3101(b). From time to time, Congress considers and passes legislation to adjust or suspend this limit. Legislation adjusting the debt limit takes the form of an amendment to 31 U.S.C. 3101(b), usually striking the current dollar limitation and inserting a new one. In recent years, such legislation has taken the form of suspending the debt limit through a date certain with an increase to the dollar limit made administratively at the end of the suspension period. At the beginning of the 116 th Congress, the House adopted a standing rule that would provide for legislation suspending the statutory debt limit to be considered as passed by the House, without a separate vote, when the House adopts the budget resolution for a fiscal year. This House rule is similar to a previous one related to the debt limit (commonly referred to as the \"Gephardt rule,\" named after its original sponsor, former Representative Richard Gephardt), which was first adopted in 1979 but was repealed at the beginning of the 112 th Congress in 2011. The House may also consider debt limit legislation without resorting to the new debt limit rule (and also did so under the former Gephardt rule) either as freestanding legislation, as part of another measure, or as part of a budget reconciliation bill. The Senate does not have (and has never had) a comparable procedure. If it chooses under the new rule to consider such debt limit legislation, it would do so under its regular legislative process. This report first explains the current House debt limit rule, particularly in relation to the former Gephardt rule. Then, it describes the legislative history of the former rule and reviews how the former rule operated before it was repealed at the beginning of the 112 th Congress. House Rule XXVIII requires that the House clerk, when the House adopts the budget resolution for a fiscal year, automatically engross and transmit to the Senate a joint resolution suspending the public debt limit through the end of that year. In other words, such legislation suspending the debt limit would be passed by the House without a separate vote on the debt limit legislation. Instead of a separate vote, the rule stipulates that the vote on the budget resolution is to be considered as the vote on the debt legislation. The new House debt limit rule differs from the former rule in two respects. First, under the new rule, the debt limit legislation is passed and sent to the Senate when the House adopts the budget resolution, not when the House and Senate agree to the budget resolution. Second, the debt legislation would suspend the debt limit, not explicitly set a new debt limit. Under the former rule, the debt limit legislation would provide for a specific new debt limit, indicating the amount by which the debt limit would be increased. In contrast, as a suspension of the debt limit, the new rule would provide for legislation that accommodates the variability of federal collections and past obligations but retain the ability of Congress to revisit the effects of such revenues and existing obligations. The current rule, as well as the former rule, does not affect the House Ways and Means Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over debt limit legislation. The full text of the current debt limit rule is provided in the Appendix . The Gephardt rule, initially codified as Rule XLIX of the Standing Rules of the House of Representatives, was established by P.L. 96-78 (93 Stat. 589-591), an act to provide for a temporary increase in the public debt limit. The House adopted the legislation ( H.R. 5369 ) by a vote of 219-198 on September 26, 1979. During consideration of the measure, Representative Gephardt explained that the purpose of the new House rule was to place the consideration of the public debt limit within the context of the overall budget policies contained in the annual budget resolution. In addition, it was intended to reduce the amount of time spent and the number of votes in the House and in committees on the issue of raising the public debt limit. One of the aggregate amounts required to be included in the annual budget resolution is the appropriate level of the public debt. The budget resolution, however, does not become law. Therefore, the enactment of subsequent legislation is necessary in order to change the statutory limit on the public debt. The Gephardt rule enables the House to combine the finalization of the budget resolution and the origination of debt limit legislation into a single step. Representative Gephardt stated that the new automatic engrossment process puts the consideration of the appropriate level for the debt ceiling where it legitimately and logically belongs. That is in the context of when we vote for the spending that creates the need to change the debt ceiling. In its original form, the rule required the engrossment of a joint resolution changing the temporary public debt limit. In 1983, the separate temporary and permanent statutory limits on the public debt were combined into one permanent statutory limit ( P.L. 98-34 ). Subsequently, the House amended the Gephardt rule to reflect this change by agreeing to H.Res. 241 (98 th Congress) by voice vote on June 23, 1983. Under the modified rule, the automatically engrossed joint resolution would contain a change to the permanent statutory limit. In addition to this modification, the rules change also provided that where a budget resolution contains more than one public debt limit figure (for the current and the next fiscal year), only one joint resolution be engrossed, containing the debt limit figure for the current fiscal year with a time limitation, and the debt limit figure for the following fiscal year as the permanent limit. During consideration of H.Res. 241 , Representative Butler C. Derrick explained the limitation of a single joint resolution by stating the following: The Committee on Rules ... believes that it is unnecessary and confusing to have ... a single concurrent resolution on the budget trigger the engrossment and passage of two separate joint resolutions to increase or decrease the public debt [limit]. At the beginning of the 106 th Congress (1999-2000), the House recodified the rule as House Rule XXIII. Certain language was deleted and modified from the existing rule, but the revisions were intended to continue the automatic engrossment process \"without substantive change.\" The House repealed the rule at the beginning of the 107 th Congress (2001-2002). On the opening day of the 108 th Congress (2003-2004), however, the House reinstated this automatic engrossing process as a new rule, Rule XXVII. The reinstated rule contained the same language as Rule XXIII of the 106 th Congress. The rule was redesignated (without change) as Rule XXVIII during the 110 th Congress upon the enactment of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 ( S. 1 , P.L. 110-81 , September 14, 2007, see Section 301(a)). Finally, as noted above, the House repealed the previous rule at the beginning of the 112 th Congress (2011-2012). More recently, the House restored and revised the rule at the beginning of the 116 th Congress. Table 1 provides information on the joint resolutions changing the public debt limit that were engrossed and deemed passed by the House pursuant to the Gephardt rule during calendar years 1980-2010. The rule, however, did not operate in all of these years. In 11 of the 31 years between 1980 and 2010, the rule was either suspended (1988, 1990-1991, 1994-1997, and 1999-2000) or repealed (2001-2002) by the House. In most cases, the House suspended the rule because legislation changing the statutory limit was not necessary. At the time, the existing public debt limit was expected to be sufficient. In three cases, the House passed or was expected to pass separate legislation to increase the statutory limit. As noted above, the rule was repealed at the beginning of the 107 th Congress and therefore did not apply in 2001 and 2002. During the remaining 20 years, when the rule was in effect, the House originated 20 joint resolutions under this procedure. The first seven of these 20 joint resolutions were generated under the Gephardt rule in its original form. As mentioned above, the rule was modified in 1983. It generally remained in this form through 2010. The subsequent 13 joint resolutions were generated under this modified language. In four years (calendar years 1998, 2004, 2006, and 2010), while the rule was in effect, the House and Senate did not agree to a conference report on the budget resolution, and therefore the automatic engrossment process under the Gephardt rule was not used. As Table 1 shows, although budget resolutions adopted during this period contained debt limit amounts for between three and 11 different fiscal years—as the time frame of each budget resolution dictated—the joint resolutions automatically engrossed under the Gephardt rule contained debt limit amounts for only one or two fiscal years, depending on the requirements of the rule at the time. The 1983 modification, as noted above, provided that the automatically engrossed joint resolution could include multiple debt limit increases—one temporary and another permanent. The first three of the 11 joint resolutions automatically engrossed pursuant to this modified version of the rule contained two different public debt limits, and the other eight contained a single public debt limit. The Senate passed 16 of the 20 joint resolutions automatically engrossed pursuant to the Gephardt rule, passing 10 without amendment and six with amendments. The 10 joint resolutions passed without amendment were sent to the President and signed into law. The six joint resolutions amended by the Senate required a vote of the House before being sent to the President. Five of these ultimately became law. Of the remaining four joint resolutions, the Senate began consideration on one but came to no resolution on it, and it took no action on three. Between 1980 and 2010, a total of 47 public debt limit changes were signed into law as independent measures or as part of other legislation. The Gephardt rule originated less than a third of these changes. That is, over two-thirds of the 47 public debt limit changes enacted into law during this period originated by procedures other than the House rule, each requiring the House to vote on such legislation. However, the rule effectively allowed the House to avoid a separate, direct vote on 10 (or 21%) of the 47 measures changing the debt limit that were ultimately enacted into law. RULE XXVIII STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE PUBLIC DEBT 1. Upon adoption by the House of a concurrent resolution on the budget under section 301 or 304 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Clerk shall prepare an engrossment of a joint resolution suspending the statutory limit on the public debt in the form prescribed in clause 2. Upon engrossment of the joint resolution, the vote by which the concurrent resolution on the budget was adopted by the House shall also be considered as a vote on passage of the joint resolution in the House, and the joint resolution shall be considered as passed by the House and duly certified and examined. The engrossed copy shall be signed by the Clerk and transmitted to the Senate for further legislative action. 2. The matter after the resolving clause in a joint resolution described in clause 1 shall be as follows: 'Section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code, shall not apply for the period beginning on the date of enactment and ending on September 30, .' with the blank being filled with the budget year for the concurrent resolution. 3. Nothing in this rule shall be construed as limiting or otherwise affecting— (a) the power of the House or the Senate to consider and pass bills or joint resolutions, without regard to the procedures under clause 1, that would change the statutory limit on the public debt; or (b) the rights of Members, Delegates, the Resident Commissioner, or committees with respect to the introduction, consideration, and reporting of such bills or joint resolutions. 4. In this rule the term 'statutory limit on the public debt' means the maximum face amount of obligations issued under authority of chapter 31 of title 31, United States Code, and obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States (except such guaranteed obligations as may be held by the Secretary of the Treasury), as determined under section 3101(b) of such title after the application of section 3101(a) of such title, that may be outstanding at any one time.", "answers": ["Essentially all of the outstanding debt of the federal government is subject to a statutory limit, which is set forth as a dollar limitation in 31 U.S.C. 3101(b).

Then, it describes the legislative history of the former rule and reviews how the former rule operated before it was repealed at the beginning of the 112th Congress.

During the years in which the rule applied (i.e., in the remaining 20 of the 31 years between 1980 and 2010), the rule led to the automatic engrossment of 20 House joint resolutions increasing the statutory limit on the public debt. In effect, under the rule, in these cases, the House was able to initiate legislation increasing the level of the public debt limit without a separate, direct vote on the legislation. Of these 20 joint resolutions, 15 became law. In 10 of these 15 cases, the Senate passed the measure without change, allowing it to be sent to the President for his signature without any further action by the House. In the remaining 5 cases, the Senate amended the rule-initiated legislation, requiring the House to vote on the amended legislation before it could be sent to the President.

{"input": "", "context": "A t the beginning of each Congress, the House of Representatives must adopt rules to govern its proceedings. The House does this by readopting the rules of the previous Congress along with any changes that will apply in the new Congress. On January 3, 2019, the House considered and adopted H.Res. 5 , a resolution providing for the consideration of H.Res. 6 , including separate votes on each of the three titles comprising H.Res. 6 . Title I, the standing rules for the House of Representatives for the 116 th Congress, was adopted by a vote of 234-197 on January 3, 2019. In addition to the standing rules, H.Res. 6 includes several additional provisions, called separate orders, that also govern proceedings in the House. A number of the provisions adopted both as part of the standing rules of the House and as separate orders might affect the consideration of budgetary legislation. In many cases, these provisions are similar to provisions adopted in previous Congresses. This report provides information on changes to both the standing rules and separate orders that might affect the consideration of budgetary legislation in the House of Representatives during the 116 th Congress. The 104 th Congress (1995-1996) added a provision to clause 2(d) of House Rule X that required that each standing committee adopt (by February 15 of the first session of a Congress) its own oversight plan for the Congress. H.Res. 5 (115 th Congress) added language specifically requesting that committees review authorizations for programs or agencies within their jurisdiction. This language was dropped from Rule X for the 116 th Congress. A provision was added to House rules in the 105 th Congress that authorized the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means to request the Joint Committee on Taxation to prepare a dynamic estimate of revenue changes proposed in a measure designated by the majority leader as major tax legislation. In the 108 th Congress, this provision was modified to establish a point of order against the consideration of a measure reported from the Committee on Ways and Means to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 unless the report included a macroeconomic impact analysis (often referred to as \"dynamic scoring\") or an explanation of why such an analysis was not calculable. In the 114 th Congress, this provision was supplanted by a requirement that any budgetary estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) include, to the extent practicable, a macroeconomic impact analysis as well as a requirement that any estimate provided to CBO by the Joint Committee on Taxation also include a macroeconomic impact analysis. This language was dropped from Rule XIII for the 116 th Congress. A provision was added to House rules in the 104 th Congress that required the vote of a three-fifths majority to approve a federal income tax rate increase. In the 105 th Congress, this provision was modified to clarify its application. This language was dropped from Rule XXI for the 116 th Congress. In addition, a requirement in House Rule XX to automatically order the yeas and nays for a vote of the House on such measures was also dropped for the 116 th Congress. A limit on the public debt is fixed by law and may be changed or suspended by enactment of a bill or joint resolution. A former rule of the House (known as the ''Gephardt rule'' after Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri) provided for a measure to amend the debt to automatically be engrossed and deemed to have been passed by the House by the same vote as the adoption by the House of a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget setting forth a level of the public debt different from the existing statutory limit, thereby avoiding the need for a separate vote on the debt limit. The engrossed measure would then be transmitted to the Senate for further action. This rule was first added to the standing rules of the House as Rule XLIX by P.L. 96-78 , although it was renumbered as Rule XXVIII as part of the recodification of House rules in the 106 th Congress. In several instances in the 104 th -106 th Congresses the rule was suspended so that it did not provide for the automatic engrossment of legislation based on changes in the public debt in concurrent resolutions. The rule was repealed in the 107 th Congress, reinstated in the 108 th Congress, and repealed again in the 112 th Congress. H.Res. 6 established a similar requirement as House Rule XXVIII. This new language provides for a measure to automatically be engrossed and deemed to have been passed by the House by the same vote as the adoption by the House of the concurrent resolution on the budget setting forth a level of the public debt different from the existing statutory limit. Rather than a specific level of debt, this measure would suspend the debt limit through the end of the budget year for the concurrent resolution on the budget (but not through the period covered by any outyears beyond the budget year). As with the earlier version of the rule, the engrossed measure would then be transmitted to the Senate for further action. H.Res. 6 reestablished a PAYGO requirement in the House, which had been in effect during the 110 th and 111 th Congresses. The new PAYGO rule (Rule XXI, clause 10) prohibits the consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that is projected to increase or cause a deficit in either of two time periods: (1) the period consisting of the current fiscal year, the budget year, and the four ensuing fiscal years following the budget year or (2) the 11-year period consisting of the current year, the budget year, and the ensuing nine fiscal years following the budget year. The rule applies to any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that affects direct spending or revenues. The House PAYGO rule replaced the House CUTGO rule that was adopted by the House at beginning of the 112 th Congress and was in effect though the end of the 115 th Congress. The CUTGO rule prohibited the consideration of any legislation that would have the net effect of increasing direct spending over the same two time periods noted above. Under the House PAYGO rule, one or more provisions in a measure may be exempted from the rule by being designating as an \"emergency.\" Section (c) of the rule states that the exemption may apply to any legislative text designated as an emergency within a bill or joint resolution, an amendment made in order as original text by a resolution reported from the House Committee on Rules, a conference report, or an amendment between the Houses. The exemption does not apply to other amendments even if the amendment includes an emergency designation. The House PAYGO rule also provides flexibility by allowing two measures that have been combined to \"offset\" one another so long as their net effect would comply with the rule. Specifically, Section (b) of the rule states that in the event that a resolution reported from the House Committee on Rules directs the Clerk of the House to add legislative text (that has already passed the House) as new matter to another piece of legislation, the legislative provisions can be evaluated together for compliance with the rule. Language prohibiting House consideration of legislation that would cause a long-term increase in spending was previously adopted by the House as a separate order in the 112 th and 115 th Congresses and adopted in budget resolutions in the 113 th Congress ( H.Con.Res. 96 ) and 114 th Congress ( S.Con.Res. 11 ). This language generally required CBO to estimate whether certain legislation would cause a net increase in spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the four 10-year periods beginning with the fiscal year 10 years after the current fiscal year and also prohibited the House from considering legislation that would cause such an increase. This language was not included in H.Res. 6 . Although budget authority for most federal programs is provided through annual appropriations actions that allow those funds to be obligated during the ensuing fiscal year, funding for certain programs is provided with a different period of availability. The term advance appropriations is applied to funds that will become available for obligation one or more fiscal years after the budget year covered by the appropriations act. In recent years the House has adopted limits on the level of advance appropriations that may be provided as well as the programs or activities for which it may be provided. In some instances, these limits have been established in a budget resolution, as in S.Con.Res. 13 (111 th Congress) and S.Con.Res. 11 (114 th Congress). In other instances, the House has adopted the limit as a separate order as part of the resolution adopting the chamber's rules, as in H.Res. 5 (112 th Congress) and H.Res. 5 (115 th Congress). In the 116 th Congress, a separate order prohibits advance appropriations that exceed (1) $28,852,000,000 for FY2020 in new budget authority for programs or activities identified in a list submitted to the Congressional Record by the chair of the Budget Committee under the heading \"Accounts Identified for Advance Appropriations\" and (2) $75,550,600,000 for FY2020 in new budget authority for programs and activities identified under the heading \"Veterans Accounts Identified for Advance Appropriations.\" Advance appropriation is defined in the provision to apply to funding provided in FY2019 appropriations acts that are to become available in any fiscal year following FY2019. A point of order under Section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act prohibits the consideration of measures or amendments that would cause the measure to exceed an allocation made pursuant to Section 302(a) or, in the case of appropriations bills, a suballocation pursuant to Section 302(b). In addition, as a consequence of this point of order, Members may offer amendments to increase the amount of budget authority in an appropriations bill only if it included budget authority less than the level of the applicable 302(b) suballocation, or if it was accompanied by one (or more) provisions that could serve as an offset. This point of order was previously supplemented by a separate orderâfirst adopted during the 109 th Congress (2005-2006) as a freestanding resolution ( H.Res. 248 )âproviding that a motion that the Committee of the Whole rise and report an appropriations bill to the House is not in order if the bill, as amended, exceeds the applicable 302(b) suballocation. This provision was adopted as a separate order for the 110 th -115 th Congresses, but it is not applicable for the 116 th Congress. The House also previously supplemented enforcement of 302(b) suballocations through language prohibiting amendments to general appropriations bills that would result in a net increase in the level of budget authority in the bill. This did not, however, prohibit amendments that would increase budget authority for an item in the bill if the amendment also included an equal or greater offset. This prohibition was adopted as a separate order in the 112 th , 113 th , and 114 th Congresses and as part of House Rule XXI for the 115 th Congress, but it is not applicable for the 116 th Congress. This provision was previously included as a standing order for the 112 th -115 th Congresses. The order required that any general appropriations bill include a spending reduction account. This \"account\" was a provision in the last section of the bill to function as a temporary deposit box into which amendments could transfer budget authority and not be available as an offset for further amendments during consideration of that bill. This language was not included in Â  H.Res. 6 . Although congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding, House rules provide for exceptions in certain circumstances. One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the \"Holman rule\" (after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876). In the 115 th Congress the House adopted a special order to provide that retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill shall be construed as applying to any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures byâ (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. This language was initially adopted in H.Res. 5 (115 th Congress) to apply to the first session of the 115 th Congress. Its applicability was extended to the second session of the 115 th Congress by H.Res. 787 (115 th Congress), but this language is not applicable in the 116 th Congress .", "answers": ["On January 3, 2019, the House adopted Title I of H.Res. 6 , the standing rules for the House of Representatives for the 116 th Congress. In addition to the standing rules, H.Res. 6 included a separate order related to the consideration of appropriations bills. This report provides information on changes to both the standing rules and separate orders that might affect the consideration of budgetary legislation in the House of Representatives. These include the following: Deleting language in Rule X added in the 115 th Congress providing for committees to include a review of authorizations for programs or agencies within their jurisdiction in their oversight plans. Deleting language in Rule XIII, previously adopted in the 114 th and 115 th Congresses, requiring that any budgetary estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) include, to the extent practicable, a macroeconomic impact analysis (often referred to as \"dynamic scoring\") as well as a requirement that any estimate provided to CBO by the Joint Committee on Taxation also include a macroeconomic impact analysis. Deleting language added to Rule XXI in the 104 th Congress requiring the vote of a three-fifths majority to approve a federal income tax rate increase as well as a requirement in Rule XX to automatically order the yeas and nays for a vote of the House on such measures. Establishing new language as Rule XXVIII providing for certain measures concerning the debt limit to automatically be engrossed and deemed to have been passed by the House. This measure would suspend the debt limit through the end of the budget year in the concurrent resolution on the budget (but not through the period covered by any outyears beyond the budget year). The engrossed measure would then be transmitted to the Senate for further action. This rule is similar to language that was previously part of House rules from the 96 th -107 th Congresses (known as the \"Gephardt Rule\"). Reestablishing a PAYGO requirement in the House, which had previously been in effect during the 110 th and 111 th Congresses. This PAYGO rule (Rule XXI, clause 10) replaces the CUTGO rule that was a part of Rule XXI between the 112 th and 115 th Congresses. The new rule prohibits the consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that is projected to increase or cause a deficit in either of two time periods: (1) the period consisting of the current fiscal year, the budget year, and the four ensuing fiscal years following the budget year or (2) the 11-year period consisting of the current year, the budget year, and the ensuing nine fiscal years following the budget year. The rule applies to any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that affects direct spending or revenues. H.Res. 6 also included a separate order establishing a limit on advance appropriations, defined as applying to funding provided in FY2019 appropriations acts that are to become available in any fiscal year following FY2019. In addition, several separate orders from previous congresses are not included in H.Res. 6 for the 116 th Congress. These include language prohibiting House consideration of measures estimated by CBO as causing a net increase in spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the four 10-year periods beginning with the fiscal year 10 years after the current fiscal year, two points of order that previously supplemented the point of order in Section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as a means for enforcing 302(b) suballocations, language requiring that appropriations bills include a spending reduction account, and language allowing certain legislative amendments in appropriations bills (known as the \"Holman Rule\")."], "length": 2811, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bb8fb3def4d0c95ac4f38319cb5222f4c0ae7eb65403480c"}
{"input": "", "context": "The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with the People's Republic of China (China) remains a major source of bilateral tension. Some Members of Congress and other U.S. government officials often point to the bilateral trade imbalance as evidence that China is not competing fairly in the global market. In March 2018, the Trump Administration reportedly asked China to develop a plan to reduce the bilateral trade deficit by $100 billion. On March 31, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13786, which states: Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), in consultation with the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, Defense, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, and the heads of any other executive departments or agencies with relevant expertise, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR, shall prepare and submit to the President an Omnibus Report on Significant Trade Deficits (Report). President Trump also issued Executive Order 13796, \"Addressing Trade Agreement Violations and Abuses,\" on April 29, 2017, which, among other things, requires the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR to \"conduct comprehensive performance reviews\" of \"all trade relations with countries governed by the rules of the World Trade Organization with which the United States does not have free trade agreements but with which the United States runs significant trade deficits in goods.\" China is one such country. Despite the priority the Trump Administration has placed on reducing bilateral trade deficits in general, and with China in particular, according to official U.S. trade statistics, the overall U.S. merchandise trade deficit and the bilateral deficit with China increased in 2017 and 2018. The overall deficit rose from $736.6 billion in 2016 to $795.7 billion in 2017, and $878.7 billion in 2018. The bilateral deficit with China accounted for 47.1%, 47.2%, and 47.7% of the total merchandise trade deficit for the last three years, respectively. Debate over this trade deficit is hampered by disagreement between the two countries on how large the deficit actually is. According to official U.S. figures, China has surpassed Canada as the largest supplier of U.S. imports, running up a bilateral merchandise trade surplus in 2018 of $419.2 billion. However, according to official Chinese figures, China's trade surplus with the United States in 2018 was $323.9 billion—$95.9 billion less than the U.S. figure (see Table 1 ). The U.S. trade deficit with China plays a role, directly and indirectly, in proposed legislation addressing bilateral trade relations. The Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act ( H.R. 704 and S. 2 ), for example, refers to \"a severely imbalanced trading relationship\" with China, and would impose restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States \"due to its negative effect on the United States trade deficit and wages of workers in the United States.\" The United States Reciprocal Trade Act ( H.R. 764 ) finds, \"The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and nontariff barriers contributes to the large and growing United States trade deficit in goods, which is a drag on economic growth and undermines economic prosperity.\" The act would authorize the President to negotiate an agreement with a country that has higher tariff or nontariff barriers than the United States, or impose additional duties on that country's exports to the United States. Table 1 lists the official trade statistics from the United States and China for the years 2001 to 2018, using official trade data. From the U.S. perspective, its bilateral trade deficit with China more than quintupled in value over the last 18 years, from just over $83 billion in 2001 to over $419 billion in 2018. However, from the Chinese view, its bilateral trade surplus with the United States increased more than 11-fold, from about $28 billion in 2001 to more than $323 billion in 2018. Table 1 reveals that most of the discrepancy between the trade data from the two nations stems from significantly different figures for China's exports to the United States. The difference between the U.S. and Chinese figures for U.S. exports to China was generally less than $10 billion until 2011, but the discrepancy has been rising in recent years. China's figures for its exports to the United States differed from U.S. figures by $48.3 billion in 2001 and $61.1 billion in 2018. The most widely used international system for classifying traded goods is the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the Harmonized System or simply HS Code. Every product traded is classified into a 10-digit code. The first two digits of the product's code correspond to one of the 98 HS \"chapters,\" that classify all goods in general categories. The U.S. International Trade Commission maintains the U.S. version of the HS Code, officially called the \"Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States,\" or HTS. Since both the United States and China use the same HS chapters, it is possible to compare the trade data at this level. Table 2 lists in rank order the top five HS chapters where the value of U.S. imports from China exceeds the value of Chinese exports to the United States for 2018. The top five HS chapters—footwear (64), machinery (84), electrical machinery (85), optical and medical instruments (90), and toys and sporting goods (95)—account for more than 94% of the difference between the U.S. and Chinese figures for U.S. imports from China (or Chinese exports to the United States). All five of these chapters also ranked high according to both countries in terms of their absolute value of trade. Machinery (84), electrical machinery (85), and toys and sporting goods (95) were among the top five ranked chapters in terms of the value of imports from China, according to the United States, and accounted for 54.7% of the total value of imports in 2018. The same three chapters were among the top five sources of exports to the United States, according to China, and accounted for 50.5% of the total value of exports in 2018. In addition, China's export value for four chapters exceeded U.S. import value by more than $1 billion (in order): Railway equipment (86) - $2.856 billion; knit apparel (61) - $2.840 billion; woven apparel (62) - $1.618 billion; and non-railway vehicles (87) - $1.130 billion. On the other side of the trade equation, there were 10 chapters where China's imports exceeded U.S. exports by more than $1 billion: miscellaneous grains (12); mineral fuel (27); pharmaceutical products (30); miscellaneous chemical products (38); plastic (39); precious stones and metals (71); machinery (84); electrical machinery (85); non-railway vehicles (87); and optical and medical equipment (90). In one chapter—railway equipment (86)—U.S. exports exceeded Chinese imports by more than $1 billion. On both sides of the trade balance equation, two of the greatest differences in the official trade statistics of the two nations occurred in the same HS chapters—machinery (84) and electrical machinery (85). The discrepancies between the official trade statistics for these two types of goods have been consistently large for flows in both directions since 2001, indicating a systemic difference in the evaluation of the bilateral trade of these goods. The question as to why China's official statistics (on trade flows) are routinely much lower in value than the official U.S. trade statistics has been and continues to be the subject of analysis by scholars, government officials, and other interested parties. Nor is the issue unique to the United States; Canada also reports bilateral trade statistics that differ significantly from China's reported figures, and has investigated the reasons for those differences. The following is a short review of some of the key explanations provided in this literature, categorized into \"technical\" and \"non-technical\" explanations. \"Technical\" explanations refer to procedural or administrative causes for the discrepancies; \"non-technical\" explanations include causes arising from non-procedural or non-administrative sources. In its official statistics, China evaluates exports using the more commonly used \"free on board\" (F.O.B.) terms, and evaluates imports using \"cost, insurance, and freight\" (C.I.F.) terms. The use of F.O.B. for exports and C.I.F. for imports is a common, but not universal, international practice. The United States, however, reports its exports using \"free alongside\" (F.A.S.) terms and values imports using a customs definition. As a result, official U.S. trade data place a lower value on both U.S. exports to China and imports from China than the official Chinese data. In addition, direct comparisons of the official U.S. and Chinese trade balances reported in the media are potentially misleading, because the goods trades are being evaluated using different methods. For more accurate direct comparisons, the trade data for both nations should be evaluated using the same terms. The United States includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in its trade data; China does not. China treats Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as separate customs territories. According to most studies, this is a comparatively minor source of difference in the trade figures. Because of the distance between China and the United States, it takes time between the export of the goods from China and their import in the United States. Goods in transit at the end of the year are counted as exports by China, but not as imports by the United States. However, the lag between shipments occurs at the beginning and the end of the year, thus minimizing the effect of timing on the overall trade balance difference. The current practice of U.S. Customs is to rely on the declaration of the importer to determine the country of origin. Some analysts believe that importers are misidentifying a significant amount of imports as Chinese. Because China's currency, the renminbi (RMB), is allowed to fluctuate within a small range, the exchange rate between the renminbi and the U.S. dollar changes over time. The value of a shipment may change between the date it leaves China and the date it arrives in the United States due to changes in the exchange rate. Although the renminbi has appreciated against the U.S. dollar over the last decade, exchange rate changes are generally not considered a major factor in the discrepancy in the trade figures. According to two joint China-U.S. studies (see \" Joint China-U.S. Studies of Discrepancies \" below), about half of the merchandise trade discrepancy between U.S. imports from China and Chinese exports to the United States—or eastbound trade—is attributable to changes in the values of the export price in China and the import value in the United States for goods shipped directly between the two countries. Part of the difference may be caused by mid-shipment transfers in ownership resulting in the new owner adding a markup in the price. Another possible explanation is intentional under-invoicing of exports (see below). Some analysts believe that Chinese importers may intentionally under-value imports from the United States to lower the import tariff due on the shipment. In addition, some analysts believe that Chinese exporters may intentionally under-value exports to the United States to maximize their net proceeds overseas for various tax and regulatory reasons. More recently, bilateral trade figures may have been distorted by \"phantom goods\" shipments from China to the United States (and other locations) used to disguise attempts to move financial capital offshore. Due to the \"hidden nature\" of under-invoicing, it is difficult to assess how much, if at all, this may be contributing to the differences in the trade data. Although estimates vary, many analysts agree that a large portion of China's exports arrive in the United States via a third party, Hong Kong being the most commonly identified location. The intermediation of shipments raises two sources of discrepancies. First, the exporter from China may not know that the goods eventually will be shipped to the United States, and may therefore list the third party (e.g., Hong Kong) as its destination, but U.S. Customs may list the source of shipment as being China, based on U.S. laws and regulations. Second, the value of the shipment may change—with or without any actual change in the goods—between its arrival in and departure from the third location. The joint China-U.S. study of discrepancies in merchandise trade statistics determined that value differences account for about half of the differences between Chinese and U.S. trade statistics. In April 2004, the 15 th JCCT established a statistical working group, with representatives of China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs, and the U.S. Department of Commerce and Office of the USTR. The initial focus of the working group was to examine the \"unusually large and growing statistical discrepancies in the bilateral merchandise trade data officially published by [the] two countries.\" The Working Group subsequently decided to conduct a reconciliation study to determine the causes of the discrepancies. However, the Working Group stated that the results of the study were not intended to imply errors in either nation's statistical systems and/or methods of calculating official merchandise trade data. Under the auspices of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), China's Ministry of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Commerce and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) have conducted two studies to determine the causes of the statistical discrepancies in the official merchandise trade data reported by both nations. The first report was released in October 2009; the second in December 2012. The main conclusions of the two studies are largely the same. The greatest discrepancy is in the \"eastbound trade\" data, which accounts for 80%-90% of the overall difference in annual trade balance. Roughly half of the \"eastbound trade\" data discrepancy can be attributed to goods that \"leave China, enter the commerce of intermediate countries or regions, and then [are] re-exported to the United States.\" The release of the official U.S. annual trade figures has been frequently followed by expressions of concern about the size of U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China. According to official U.S. trade figures, the bilateral trade deficit with China in 2017 was more than five times the size of the next largest bilateral trade deficit (Mexico, $71.1 billion) and greater than the sum of the next eight largest bilateral trade deficits. China has not accepted the \"accuracy\" of the official U.S. figure for the Sino-U.S. trade balance for at least two decades. A 1997 White Paper issued by China's State Council, \"On Sino-US Trade Balance,\" states, \"Statistics and analyses prove it true that Sino-US trade has been in favour of China in recent years, but it is obvious that the size of the US deficit has been largely exaggerated by the US side.\" In 2007, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said, \"imbalances in China-U.S. trade are an objective fact, but this is also related to the two sides' different statistical methods.\" Also, when considering means or actions designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, it is useful to know which goods are the main sources of discrepancies between Chinese and U.S. trade figures, and how important they are in the overall trade flow between the two nations, so that \"trade remedies\" may be better targeted at the perceived problem. According to this report, the main problems appear to be in the trade figures for electrical machinery, machinery, and toys and sporting goods. For those causes of the differences resulting from data compilation—such as misidentification of value or country of origin of imports—Congress may choose through oversight or other means to encourage the responsible U.S. agency to examine and adjust its procedures for compiling trade data. In addition, Congress may decide to press or otherwise encourage China's customs services to conduct a similar review of its trade compilation procedures. In other cases, more detailed analysis of the trade data may be helpful in persuading China to amend or alter its laws, regulations, and policies pertaining to the import or export of goods to the United States. \"Accounting for Discrepancies in Bilateral Trade: The Case of China, Hong Kong, and the United States,\" by Michael J.

Volume 3, No. 1, pp. 131-154.", "answers": ["The size of the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China has been and continues to be an important issue in bilateral trade relations. President Trump and some Members of Congress view the deficit as a sign of unfair economic policies in China. The Trump Administration has reportedly asked China to develop a plan to reduce the bilateral trade deficit by $100 billion. In the 116th Congress, the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act (H.R. 704 and S. 2) and the United States Reciprocal Trade Act (H.R. 764) mention U.S. trade deficits as a reason for the proposed legislation. There is a large and growing difference between the official trade statistics released by the United States and the People's Republic of China. According to the United States, the 2018 bilateral merchandise trade deficit with China was $419.2 billion. According to China, its trade surplus with the United States was $323.3 billion—a $95.9 billion difference. This report examines the differences in the trade data from the two nations in two ways. First, it compares the trade figures using the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System) to discern any patterns in the discrepancies between the U.S. and Chinese data. This comparison reveals that more than 94% of the difference in the value of China's exports to the United States in 2018 was attributable to five types of goods. Those five types of goods, in order of the size of the discrepancy, were electrical machinery, machinery, toys and sporting goods, optical and medical equipment, and footwear. The second approach to examining the differing trade data involves a review of the existing literature on the technical and non-technical sources of the trade data discrepancies. The literature reveals that the leading sources of the discrepancies are differences in the list value of shipments when they leave China and when they enter the United States, and differing attributions of origin and destination of Chinese exports that are transshipped through a third location (such as Hong Kong) before arriving in the United States. In light of the differences in the official bilateral merchandise trade data, the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) established a statistical working group in 2004. The working group has released two reconciliation studies (in 2009 and 2012) to identify the causes of the statistical discrepancies. The Working Group stated that the adjustments contained in the two studies are not meant to imply errors in the official statistics of either country. This report is updated annually, after the release of official trade data by China and the United States."], "length": 3299, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d117dc36b553cb1a57a406a870a9bf83575c74c5138f4622"}
{"input": "", "context": "DOD has established 10 cross-functional teams that OCMO officials consider responsive to section 911, and these teams are in various stages of implementation. The Secretary of Defense established a cross- functional team to manage the transfer of background investigations for DOD personnel security clearances from the Office of Personnel Management to DOD. This team is required to report directly to the Secretary. In addition, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established 9 additional cross-functional teams to implement reform initiatives for improving DOD’s business operations. These teams report to the CMO. In August 2017, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum authorizing its first cross-functional team in response to section 911 to address challenges with personnel vetting and background investigation programs. The memorandum notes that a backlog of background investigations affects DOD’s mission readiness, critical programs, and operations. According to the memorandum, this cross-functional team will conduct a full review of current personnel vetting processes to identify a redesigned process for DOD’s security, suitability and fitness, and credential vetting. The cross-functional team’s objectives are to develop options and recommendations to mitigate shortcomings, ensure necessary resourcing, and transform the personnel vetting enterprise. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and the Defense Security Service are leading the efforts to establish the team. Since we last reported on DOD’s efforts to establish the team, DOD has taken some steps, such as assigning some team members, but has not completed other key steps to staff and establish a direction for the team. In February 2018, we reported that DOD had selected an interim leader for the team. As of May 2018, this person, a non-Senior Executive Service individual from the Defense Security Service, was still serving as the interim leader. Section 911 requires DOD to assign a senior qualified and experienced individual as the leader of the team. According to Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence officials, the department plans to seek nominations from DOD components for a permanent leader from the Senior Executive Service, but does not have a specific timeframe for doing so. DOD also assigned seven full-time personnel to the team, who are now co-located, in accordance with requirements under section 911. These personnel are from the Army, Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service, DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, OCMO, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, and MITRE Corporation. Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence officials estimated that the team may have 20 members when it is fully staffed, but they did not have an estimate of when DOD will assign the remaining team members. In addition, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence has established priorities for the cross-functional team. For example, the team is required to prepare a project plan incorporating all key components for a DOD enterprise vetting mission—including key milestones, specific objectives, performance metrics, a resourcing plan, and an action plan for tracking key initiatives—which are key steps for establishing the team’s direction. According to Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence officials, as of May 2018, the interim leader was outlining a project plan. Filling key leadership and staff positions will be important for ensuring that the team has the knowledge and expertise from components across the department to effectively develop and implement the plan. The Deputy Secretary of Defense has established 9 additional cross- functional teams since October 2017 to implement reform initiatives intended to improve the quality and productivity of the department’s business operations, including moving toward more use of enterprise services. According to the memoranda appointing the team leaders, these teams support the Secretary of Defense’s focus on creating a more lethal and effective force by allowing the department to reallocate resources from business operations to readiness and to recapitalization of the combat force. OCMO officials stated that they consider these teams to be responsive to section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. Section 911 requires DOD to assign senior qualified and experienced individuals to lead the teams, and the Deputy Secretary of Defense generally appointed senior DOD officials as leaders. Seven leaders were appointed in October 2017, one in November 2017, and one in January 2018. According to OCMO officials, these leaders report to the CMO. As of May 2018, the size of the teams ranged from 5 to 12 members; OCMO officials stated that the size of the teams can vary based on the knowledge and expertise the team needs to implement its initiatives. The teams include representatives from the military departments, functional organizations relevant to the reform topic, and external experts. According to OCMO officials, the team leaders chose their team members from candidates proposed by the military departments and functional organizations. In addition, the members may be assigned on a full-time or part-time basis, and all of the teams have co-located space. Figure 1 provides additional details on the structure of these 9 teams. OCMO officials stated that these 9 teams are in various stages of implementing their initiatives. For example, the Human Resources team was the most recent team to be established, and OCMO officials stated the team is in the process of finalizing the identification and beginning the implementation of its reform initiatives. Other teams, such as the Financial Management and Information Technology and Business Systems teams, have identified and are in the process of implementing initiatives related to their reform areas. DOD established the Reform Management Group to identify opportunities for reform and provide support to these 9 cross-functional teams. Chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and facilitated by the CMO and Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, the Reform Management Group provides oversight and guidance, makes decisions on team recommendations, and monitors the teams’ progress, according to OCMO officials. These officials also told us that the Reform Management Group holds weekly meetings to discuss the status of the reform teams’ efforts and provides monthly comprehensive reports on these efforts to the Secretary of Defense. OCMO has drafted an organizational strategy, but DOD has not issued the strategy, which section 911 required to be completed by September 1, 2017. OCMO officials told us that they have not completed the strategy because they want to align it with the National Defense Strategy, which was issued in January 2018, and the National Defense Business Operations Plan, which was issued in May 2018. OCMO officials told us that, once the organizational strategy is reviewed internally to align with the National Defense Strategy and the National Defense Business Operations Plan, the CMO plans to coordinate the review and approval of the strategy across components within the department. We previously recommended, and DOD concurred, that the CMO should obtain input on the development of the strategy from key stakeholders, such as the military departments and defense agencies. The officials estimated that DOD components would have about 2 to 3 weeks to provide input on the strategy and that the strategy could be issued as early as July 2018. We found that, consistent with our recent recommendations, a revised version of the draft organizational strategy addresses the requirements in section 911, including outlining steps for advancing a collaborative culture within the department. In February 2018, we found that the August 2017 version of the draft organizational strategy that we reviewed addressed the two required elements under section 911, but did not outline how it would achieve several future outcomes that advance a collaborative culture within the department, as required by the NDAA. We recommended, and DOD concurred, that the CMO should revise the organizational strategy to outline how it would achieve these outcomes and, in doing so, should consider our nine leading practices on mergers and organizational transformations. Based on our review of a February 2018 version of the draft organizational strategy, we found that OCMO officials have taken steps to address our recommendation, including identifying potential action steps for the department that align with each of the nine leading practices. For example, consistent with the leading practice for establishing a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to guide the transformation, OCMO officials revised the draft strategy to propose that the CMO, in coordination with stakeholders, could develop an implementation plan with detailed initiatives for increasing collaboration and information sharing across the department. According to the draft strategy, this plan could include goals and milestones for these initiatives, and the CMO could report periodically on the achievement of the goals. Further, consistent with the leading practice to involve employees to obtain their ideas and gain their ownership for the transformation, OCMO officials proposed that a representative from OCMO could chair an action officer- level governance body to plan and share performance information related to this effort. According to the draft strategy, this governance body would solicit feedback about the related changes, propose changes to new policies and procedures based on the feedback, and manage the implementation and tracking of the established goals. Issuing the organizational strategy—in accordance with section 911 and our prior recommendation—will better position DOD to advance a collaborative culture. DOD has not fulfilled three related requirements of section 911 to guide the implementation of its cross-functional teams, namely to (1) provide training to cross-functional team members and their supervisors, (2) issue guidance on cross-functional teams, and (3) provide training to presidential appointees. OCMO officials stated that they plan to send the guidance and training curricula to the Secretary of Defense for review and approval after the organizational strategy is issued. Table 1 shows the three requirements of section 911, the due dates, and the status of DOD actions, if any, as of May 2018. As of May 2018, OCMO had developed a draft training curriculum for cross-functional team members and their supervisors, but had not provided the required training. In February 2018, we reported that the draft training curriculum addressed all requirements in section 911. OCMO officials stated that after the Secretary of Defense reviews and approves the training curriculum, which will occur after the organizational strategy is issued, they will provide training to the members of the cross- functional team on personnel vetting for background investigations and to the 9 teams implementing reform initiatives. OCMO has also drafted guidance on cross-functional teams, but DOD has not issued the guidance and did not meet the statutorily-required date of September 30, 2017. Section 911 requires the guidance to address areas such as the decision-making authority of the teams and key practices that senior leaders should follow with regard to leadership, organizational practice, collaboration, and the functioning of cross- functional teams. In February 2018, we reported that OCMO had developed draft guidance for cross-functional teams that addressed six of seven statutorily-required elements and incorporated five of eight leading practices for effective cross-functional teams that we identified in prior work. We recommended, and DOD concurred, that the CMO should fully address all requirements in section 911 and incorporate these leading practices into the guidance. DOD has taken steps to address our recommendation. For example, consistent with the practice for open and regular communication, OCMO revised the guidance to state that the cross-functional team leaders and OCMO will encourage and facilitate continuous communication and information sharing. According to the revised guidance, the team leaders and OCMO will accomplish this through co-location of team members, management practices by cross- functional team leaders that promote a unified team culture and trust, and use of collaborative information technology tools maintained by OCMO. However, as of May 2018, DOD had not issued the guidance. As we reported in February 2018, without initial guidance that fully addresses the required statutory elements in section 911 and incorporates our leading practices, DOD’s cross-functional teams may not be able to consistently and effectively pursue the Secretary of Defense’s strategic objectives or further promote a collaborative culture within the department. OCMO has developed a draft training curriculum for individuals filling presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed positions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. However, as of May 2018, DOD had filled 26 of 36 such positions, and none had received the training or been granted a training waiver. Further, section 911 requires these individuals to complete the training within 3 months of their appointment, but 22 have been in their positions longer than 3 months, as shown in figure 2. In February 2018, we reported that the draft curriculum addressed only one of the four required elements in section 911. Specifically, we found that the draft curriculum addressed the required statutory element for training on the operation of cross-functional teams, but did not incorporate the required statutory elements for leadership, modern organizational practice, or collaboration. We recommended, and DOD concurred, that the CMO should either (1) provide training that includes all of the required elements in section 911 or (2) develop criteria for obtaining a waiver and have the Secretary of Defense request such a waiver from the President for these required elements if the individual possesses—through training and experience—the skill and knowledge otherwise to be provided through a course of instruction. Once the training curriculum is reviewed and approved by the Secretary of Defense, which will occur after the organizational strategy is issued, OCMO officials plan to provide the training on the operation of cross-functional teams to the presidential appointees. These officials stated that DOD plans to develop criteria for presidential appointees who are eligible for a waiver from the training on leadership, modern organizational practice, and collaboration, and to recommend that the Secretary of Defense approve these waivers. Until DOD finalizes actions on this recommendation, the department may have difficulty advancing a collaborative culture, as top leadership commitment is a key practice for a successful organizational transformation. We are not making recommendations in this report. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. DOD concurred with our report. In addition, DOD provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, and DOD’s Chief Management Officer.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. Section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for us—every 6 months after the date of enactment on December 23, 2016, through December 31, 2019—to submit to the defense committees a report setting forth a comprehensive assessment of the actions that DOD has taken pursuant to section 911 during each 6-month period and cumulatively since the NDAA’s enactment. We issued our first report in June 2017, and did not make recommendations. We issued our second report in February 2018, and made four recommendations to improve DOD’s implementation of section 911. Table 2 identifies the two prior GAO reports on DOD’s implementation of section 911 and the status of the four recommendations from our February 2018 report. Section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 requires the Secretary of Defense to take several actions. Table 3 summarizes some of these requirements, the due date, and the date completed, if applicable, as of May 2018. In addition to the contact named above, Margaret Best (Assistant Director), Tracy Barnes, Arkelga Braxton, William Carpluk, Adelle Dantzler, Michael Holland, William Lamping, Amie Lesser, Ned Malone, Judy McCloskey, Sheila Miller, Richard Powelson, Terry Richardson, Ron Schwenn, Jared Sippel, Sarah Veale, and Tina Won Sherman made key contributions to this report.", "answers": ["DOD continues to confront organizational challenges that hinder collaboration. To address these challenges, section 911 of the NDAA for FY 2017 directed the Secretary of Defense to issue an organizational strategy that identifies critical objectives that span multiple functional boundaries and would benefit from the use of cross-functional teams. Additionally, DOD is to establish cross-functional teams to support this strategy, issue guidance on these teams, and provide training to team members and civilian leaders in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The NDAA also included a provision for GAO to periodically assess DOD's actions in response to section 911. This is GAO's third report on the implementation of section 911. It assesses the status of DOD's efforts to (1) establish cross-functional teams, (2) issue an organizational strategy, and (3) issue guidance on cross-functional teams and provide training to team members and Office of the Secretary of Defense leaders. GAO reviewed documentation on DOD's implementation of its cross-functional teams and DOD's draft organizational strategy, draft guidance on establishing cross-functional teams, and draft training curricula. GAO also interviewed DOD officials on efforts to implement section 911. GAO is not making new recommendations in this report. DOD concurred and is taking actions to address GAO's previous recommendations on DOD's implementation of section 911. DOD also concurred with the findings in a draft of this report. The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented some statutory requirements in section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, enacted in December 2016, to address organizational challenges. However, senior leadership has not implemented several requirements intended to support cross-functional teams and promote department-wide collaboration (see table). DOD has established 10 cross-functional teams, which are in various stages of implementation. Specifically, DOD is in the early stages of establishing one cross-functional team to address the backlog of the department's personnel security clearance background investigations and has assigned an interim leader and seven members to this team. In addition, DOD established 9 cross-functional teams to implement reform initiatives intended to improve the efficiency of the department's business operations. DOD generally appointed senior department officials to lead these teams, and the size of the teams, as of May 2018, ranged from 5 to 12 members. DOD has drafted, but not issued, an organizational strategy. DOD officials stated that they have not completed the strategy because they want to align it with two department-wide strategy documents—the National Defense Strategy, which was issued in January 2018, and the National Defense Business Operations Plan, which was issued in May 2018. DOD also has not fulfilled three statutory requirements related to guidance and training for cross-functional teams and civilian leaders in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Specifically, DOD has not (1) provided training to cross-functional team members, (2) issued guidance on cross-functional teams, or (3) provided training to presidential appointees in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. DOD officials stated that they plan to send the guidance and training curricula to the Secretary of Defense for review and approval after DOD issues the organizational strategy. Fully implementing these requirements and GAO's prior recommendations related to the organizational strategy, guidance, and training, will better position DOD to effectively implement its cross-functional teams and advance a collaborative culture as required by the NDAA."], "length": 3161, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bbdd0be50db54d79bb53aaae46360d9aa157779cddbbb6b3"}
{"input": "", "context": "\"Ideas can come from anywhere,\" a scholar of American politics once wrote. To be sure, ideas and recommendations for legislation come from a wide variety of sources, such as individual Representatives; committees and other House working groups; legislative staff; party and chamber leaders; executive branch agencies and the White House; states and localities; members of the media; citizens; and interest groups. Any or all of these individuals or entities may participate in drafting legislation, but only a Member of Congress may formally introduce legislation. Some common considerations taken into account when drafting a bill include the following: What problem does the bill seek to address? Understanding the source of a problem is necessary in order to properly address it. An abundance of information is available to Members in the form of reports, studies, and presentations offered by a wide range of individuals, groups, and organizations, including CRS. Soliciting expert testimony in the context of a committee hearing is another common method by which the House gathers relevant information for use in policymaking. To what committee(s) is it likely to be referred? Committee referral can matter because one committee might be especially receptive to the proposed legislation in comparison to another committee. Members may also prefer that their bill be referred to a committee on which they serve in order to ensure their continued involvement at the committee stage of proceedings. Will the bill attract cosponsors? Cosponsorship conveys a Member's support for a measure, so bills that attract many cosponsors could be seen as enjoying broad support within the chamber. A measure with many cosponsors, especially if they include committee and party leaders, could encourage the relevant committee chair to take some action on the legislation, such as hold hearings on it. Does it have bipartisan appeal? Building a coalition of support for a proposal can take time, and some amount of bipartisan cooperation may be required to secure final passage. Measures that are limited in scope but have broad bipartisan appeal are often brought to the House floor under suspension of the rules, a parliamentary procedure that limits debate and amendment and requires a supermajority vote of two-thirds for a measure to pass. What are the budgetary implications? The House places a number of restrictions on legislation with budgetary consequences. For instance, if a proposal adds to the federal deficit, it may be subject to a point of order on the chamber floor for violating congressional budget rules (many of which are codified in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974). Support for a measure may also hinge on how its costs are paid for. Members may agree about the merits of a bill but disagree with how its provisions are funded. Should companion legislation be introduced in the Senate? To become law, a bill or joint resolution must pass both houses of Congress in identical form (the same text and bill number) and be signed by the President. For this reason, House sponsors sometimes encourage allies in the Senate to introduce identical or similarly worded legislation to expedite bicameral consideration. Companion bills might also attract wider public and Member attention to the issues addressed in the legislation. Is the measure best introduced at the beginning, in the middle, or toward the end of a Congress? Timing the introduction of a measure can be important. Comprehensive legislation is likely to require a great deal of time to work through, both in committee and on the floor. An early introduction will give the House more time to examine the measure's provisions. Advantage might also be gained by being the first to address an issue. Those who move first tend to attract media attention and may be seen by their colleagues as exercising leadership in that particular policy area. Strategic delay is another option. This approach might provide more time for an individual or committee to study the issue and build support for a preferred solution. To be sure, many bills do not follow a linear (or \"regular order\") legislative process—introduction, consideration in committee, and arrival on the floor for further debate and amendment. For example, a legislative proposal that had languished in committee might suddenly be taken up because it deals with an unfolding crisis or emergency. There is no House rule that introduced bills and resolutions must be prepared by the House Office of the Legislative Counsel, but the office plays an important role by providing Members and staff, at their request, with drafts of legislation. Use of the office by Members and staff is nearly universal. Its staff attorneys are both subject matter specialists and experts in legislative drafting, and they focus almost exclusively on policy issues within their areas of expertise. Legislative attorneys are often assigned to serve a specific committee or committees as a kind of nonpartisan, shared staff, and they work closely with committee members and staff to ensure that the bill's language and form matches the intent of its sponsor and adheres to drafting rules and linguistic traditions of the House. Several drafts may be required before a measure is ready for formal introduction. Those drafting legislation may seek assistance from the Office of the Legislative Counsel at any stage. All communications with the office are treated as confidential. The office is located in Room 337 of the Ford House Office Building and can be reached at extension 5-6060 or by sending an email request to legcoun@mail.house.gov. Following introduction, the Speaker refers legislation to the appropriate committee(s) based primarily on how its contents align with the subject matter jurisdictions of committees established in clause 1 of House Rule X. According to clause 2 of House Rule XII, the Speaker shall refer legislation [I]n such a manner as to ensure to the maximum extent feasible that each committee that has jurisdiction under clause 1 of rule X over the subject matter of a provision thereof may consider such provision and report to the House thereon. The Office of the Parliamentarian advises the Speaker on committee referrals. In practice, the Parliamentarian has been delegated the responsibility for committee referrals. Representatives and staff involved in drafting legislation may consult the Office of the Parliamentarian regarding the committee(s) to which their draft measure might be referred. The office is located in Room H-209 of the Capitol (5-7373). The formal procedures that govern the introduction of legislation are few and are found in House Rule XII. \"The system for introducing measures in the House is a relatively free and open one,\" wrote former House Parliamentarian William Holmes Brown. House rules do not limit the number of bills a Member may introduce. Members may introduce legislation for any number of reasons, and they may do so on behalf of another individual, entity, or group \"by request.\" Between 1973 and 2018, Members introduced an average of about 20 bills and resolutions each per Congress. Statistics on introduced measures are presented in Table 1 . When a Representative has determined that a bill or resolution is ready for introduction, it is placed in the box, or \"hopper,\" at the bill clerk's desk on the chamber floor when the House is in session, including a \"pro forma\" session. The hopper is pictured in Figure 1 . The sponsor must sign the measure and attach the names of any original cosponsors on a form provided by the Clerk's office, which is located in Room H-154 of the Capitol Building (5-7000). Cosponsors do not sign the bill. Under the Speaker's announced policies of the 116 th Congress (2019-2020), sponsors are \"encouraged\" to obtain original signatures from cosponsors prior to submitting a cosponsorship form. The bill as drafted by legislative counsel leaves space both for the insertion of a bill number, which is assigned chronologically based on the date of introduction, and for the Parliamentarian's office to note the committee(s) to which the measure was referred. A Member need not seek recognition from the chamber's presiding officer in order to introduce a measure. Following introduction, Members often summarize the purpose and merits of their proposal in a statement published in the \"Extension of Remarks\" section of the Congressional Record . Since the 112 th Congress, House rules have required Members to provide at the time of introduction a statement of constitutional authority indicating why Congress has the authority to enact the proposed bill or joint resolution. The bill clerk does not accept a bill or joint resolution for introduction that lacks a constitutional authority statement. Clause 7(c) of Rule XII establishes that the statement must be as \"specific as practicable,\" and must be attached to the bill when it is dropped in the hopper for introduction. If no such statement is provided, then the measure will be returned to its sponsor. A point of order cannot be lodged against a bill based on the content of a constitutional authority statement. A sponsor may not reclaim a measure he or she has placed in the hopper after it has been assigned a number and referred to committee (a process that normally occurs the same day). Once a measure has been numbered and referred, it becomes the property of the House and cannot be modified by the sponsor. It is too late at this point to make any changes to the bill—however cosmetic they might be—except by amending the bill on the House floor during its consideration. Introduced bills or resolutions can be taken up by the House even if the sponsor resigns from the House or dies. In the first days of a new Congress, hundreds of bills and resolutions are introduced. Measures are usually numbered sequentially based on the date of introduction, but Representatives may seek to reserve bill numbers in advance by communicating with the Parliamentarian's office prior to introduction. Bill numbers are sometimes seen as a way to provide shorthand meaning to the legislation, enhance its visibility, or confer symbolic importance. Measures have sometimes been assigned the same number for several Congresses, perhaps because lawmakers and others have grown accustomed to referring to a bill by its number. For instance, sponsors of tax reform proposals may request H.R. 1040 as a bill number to draw attention to the 1040 tax form many individuals use to pay federal income taxes. By the same logic, a bill addressing ocular health or medical coverage for eyeglass and contact lenses might take the number H.R. 2020 because 20/20 is considered normal vision. In recent Congresses, the House has ordered that bill numbers H.R. 1 through H.R. 10 be reserved for assignment by the majority leader and numbers H.R. 11 through H.R. 20 be reserved for the minority leader. These bills, sometimes called \"message\" bills because they often represent the top agenda items of each political party, tend to generate considerable attention and coverage. The number of bills and resolutions introduced in a given Congress fluctuates over time as Table 1 shows. Some of this variation can be explained on the basis of changes in House rules and practices. From 1968 to 1978, for instance, a limit of 25 was placed on the number of cosponsorships a measure could obtain. One effect of this rule was to encourage the introduction of identically worded legislation (with a new bill number) to allow additional Members to sign on as cosponsors. The cosponsorship limit was removed in 1979, which accounts in part for the drop in introduced measures between the 95 th and 96 th Congresses. No longer was it necessary to introduce duplicative bills for the purpose of gaining cosponsors. The House has also sought to reduce the amount of commemorative legislation it considers. The rules for the 104 th Congress (1995-1996), for instance, included new restrictions on the introduction of measures that would express a commemoration \"through the designation of a specified period of time.\" The decline in the number of introduced measures in that Congress might be attributed at least in part to the new rule. The 116 th Congress (2019-2020) maintains this ban on temporal commemorations. Most measures are introduced by individual Members. Five House committees (Appropriations, Budget, Ethics, House Administration, and Rules) may also draft and report an \"original\" measure on specific subjects identified in House rules. This means that those particular committees do not have to wait for measures to be referred to them in order to act. The committee chair is often considered the sponsor when a committee reports original legislation, although the measure is perhaps best understood as a product that incorporates views and input from other committee members as well.", "answers": ["Authoring and introducing legislation is fundamental to the task of representing voters as a Member of Congress. In fact, part of what makes the American political process unique is that it affords all Members an ability to propose their own ideas for chamber consideration. By comparison, most other democratic governments around the world rely on an executive official, often called a premier, chancellor, or prime minister, to originate and submit policy proposals for discussion and enactment by the legislature. Legislators serving in other countries generally lack the power to initiate legislative proposals of their own. In the American political system, ideas and recommendations for legislation come from a wide variety of sources. Any number of individuals, groups, or entities may participate in drafting bills and resolutions, but only Members of Congress may formally introduce legislation, and they may do so for any reason.

{"input": "", "context": "Oversight of nursing homes is a shared federal-state responsibility, with CMS central and regional offices overseeing activities completed by state survey agencies. Specifically, CMS central office (1) oversees the federal quality standards nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and (2) establishes the responsibilities of CMS’s regional offices and state survey agencies to ensure federal quality standards for nursing homes are met. CMS regional offices oversee state activities and report results back to CMS central office. Specifically, regional offices are required to conduct annual federal monitoring surveys to assess the adequacy of surveys conducted by state survey agencies. CMS regional offices also evaluate state surveyors’ performance on factors such as the frequency and quality of state surveys. Finally, in each state, under agreement with CMS, a state survey agency assesses whether nursing homes meet CMS’s standards by conducting regular surveys and investigations of complaints regarding resident care or safety, as needed. CMS collects data on nursing home quality through annual standard surveys and complaint investigations, as well as other sources, such as staffing data and clinical quality measures. Standard surveys. By law, every nursing home receiving Medicare or Medicaid payment must undergo a standard survey during which teams of state surveyors conduct a comprehensive on-site evaluation of compliance with federal quality standards. Nursing homes with consistently poor performance can be selected for the Special Focus Facility (SFF) program, which requires more intensive oversight, including more frequent surveys. Complaint investigations. Nursing homes also are surveyed on an as-needed basis with investigations of consumer complaints. These complaints can be filed with state survey agencies by residents, families, ombudsmen, or others acting on a resident’s behalf. During an investigation, state surveyors evaluate the nursing home’s compliance with a specific federal quality standard. Staffing data. Nurse staffing levels are considered a key component of nursing home quality and are often measured in total nurse hours per resident day. Higher nurse staffing levels are typically linked with higher quality nursing home care. Clinical quality measures. Nursing homes are required to provide data on certain clinical quality measures—such as the incidence of pressure ulcers—for all residents to CMS. CMS currently tracks data for 18 clinical quality measures. CMS publicly reports a summary of each nursing home’s quality data on its Nursing Home Compare website using a five-star quality rating. The Five-Star Quality Rating System assigns each nursing home an overall rating and three component ratings—surveys (standard and complaint), staffing, and quality measures—based on the extent to which the nursing home meets CMS’s quality standards and other measures. In a 2016 report, we found that CMS did not have a systematic process for prioritizing recommended changes to improve its Nursing Home Compare website and that several factors limited the ability of CMS’s Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers understand nursing home quality and choose a home. We recommended that CMS establish a process to evaluate and prioritize website improvements and add explanatory information about the Five-Star System to Nursing Home Compare. HHS agreed and in 2018 completed actions on these recommendations, but has not yet acted on the other recommendations, including providing national comparison information that we maintain are important to help enable consumers to understand nursing home quality and make distinctions between nursing homes. In our October 2015 report examining trend data that give insight into nursing home quality, we found that four key data sets showed mixed results, and data issues complicated the ability to assess quality trends. Nationally, one of the four data sets—consumer complaints—suggested consumers’ concerns over nursing home quality increased from 2005 to 2014. However, the other three data sets—deficiencies, staffing levels, and clinical quality measures—indicated potential improvement in nursing home quality (see Table 1). Specifically, we found consumer complaints—which can originate from residents, families, ombudsmen, or others acting on a resident’s behalf—had a 21 percent increase from 2005 to 2014. In contrast, nurse staffing levels increased 9 percent from 2009 to 2014 and selected quality measure scores showed decreases in the number of reported quality problems, such as falls resulting in major injury from 2011 to 2014. In addition, we identified 416 homes in 36 states that had consistently poor performance across the four data sets we examined. Of the 416 homes, 71 (17 percent) were included in the Special Focus Facility (SFF) program at some point between 2005 and 2014. In our October 2015 report, we found CMS’s ability to use available data to assess nursing home quality trends was complicated by various issues with these data, which made it difficult to determine whether observed trends reflect actual changes in quality, data issues, or both. CMS has taken some actions to address these data complications, however, more work is needed. Consumer complaints: The average number of consumer complaints reported per nursing home increased in the 10 years of data we examined, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to a change in quality or to state variation in the recording of complaints. Some state survey agency officials explained that changes in how they recorded complaints into CMS’s complaint tracking system could in part account for the jump in reported complaints. In addition, officials at one state survey agency explained the increase in complaints could also reflect state-level efforts to provide consumers with more user-friendly options for filing complaints. Similarly, in April 2011, we found differences in how states record and track complaints. Deficiencies cited on standard surveys: The decline in the number of serious deficiencies—deficiencies that at a minimum caused a harm to the resident—in the data we examined may have indicated an improvement in quality, although it may also be attributed to inconsistencies in measurement. For example, the use of multiple survey types, such as both traditional paper-based surveys and electronic surveys, to conduct the standard survey that every nursing home receiving Medicare or Medicaid payment must undergo complicates the ability to compare the results of these surveys nationally. In our October 2015 report, we recommended CMS implement the same survey methodology across all states; HHS agreed with this recommendation and in November 2017 completed its national implementation of this electronic survey methodology. Nurse staffing: CMS data showed the average total nurse hours per resident day increased from 2009 through 2014, although CMS did not have assurance these data were accurate. Many of the regional office and state survey agency officials we spoke with expressed concern over the self-reported nature of these data, noting that it may be easy to misrepresent nurse staff hours. At the time of our 2015 report, CMS was in the process of implementing a system to collect staffing information based on payroll and other verifiable data and has now completed that implementation, as required by law. We recommended in 2015 that CMS establish and implement a clear plan for ongoing auditing of its staffing data and other quality data. HHS agreed with this recommendation and in July 2018 CMS provided us with documentation that it was conducting regular audits of this new nurse staffing data. According to CMS, facilities experienced challenges submitting complete and accurate data in the early stages, however, as of April 2018 the agency has begun relying on the payroll data to calculate the staffing measures that it posts in Nursing Home Compare and uses in the Five-Star Quality Rating System. Selected quality measures: Nursing homes generally improved their performance on the eight selected quality measures we reviewed, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to a change in quality or possible inaccuracies in self-reported data. Like the nurse staffing data used by CMS, data on nursing homes’ performance on these measures were self-reported, and until 2014 CMS conducted little to no auditing of these data to ensure their accuracy. In our 2015 report, we found CMS had begun taking steps to help mitigate the problem with self- reported data by starting to audit the data in 2015; however, the agency did not have clear plans to continue the audits beyond 2016. As such, in our recommendation we indicated the need for ongoing auditing of data used to calculate clinical quality measures. As of August 2018, CMS has not provided us a plan for ongoing auditing of its clinical quality measures and we continue to believe that CMS should establish and carry out such a plan. Collectively, these data issues have broader implications related to nursing home quality trends, including potential effects on the quality benchmarks CMS sets and consumers’ decisions about which nursing home to select. Furthermore, data used by CMS to assess quality measures are also used when determining Medicare payments to nursing homes, so data issues—and CMS’s internal controls related to the data— could affect the accuracy of payments. Moreover, the use of quality data for payment purposes will expand in fiscal year 2019 when a nursing home value-based purchasing program will be implemented, which will increase or reduce Medicare payments to nursing homes based on certain quality measures. Our 2015 report found that CMS had made numerous modifications to its nursing home oversight activities in recent years, but had not monitored the potential effect of these modifications on nursing home quality oversight. Some of these modifications expanded or added new oversight activities—for example, CMS expanded the number of tools available to state surveyors when investigating medication-related adverse events, increased the amount of nursing home quality data available to the public, and created new trainings for surveyors on unnecessary medication usage. However, other modifications reduced existing oversight activities. In 2015, we highlighted modifications that reduced two existing oversight activities—the federal monitoring survey program and the SFF program. Federal monitoring surveys: CMS reduced the scope of the federal monitoring surveys regional offices use to evaluate state surveyors’ skills in assessing nursing home quality. CMS requires regional offices to complete federal monitoring surveys in at least 5 percent of nursing homes surveyed by the state each year. Starting in 2013, CMS required fewer federal monitoring surveys to be standard surveys and allowed more monitoring surveys to be the narrower scoped and less-resource intensive revisits and complaint investigations. Special Focus Facilities: CMS reduced the number of nursing homes participating in the SFF program. In 2013, CMS began to reduce the number of homes in the program by instructing states to terminate homes that had been in the program for 18 months without improvement from participating in Medicare and Medicaid. As we have previously reported, between 2013 and 2014, the number of nursing homes in the SFF program dropped by more than half—from 152 to 62. In 2014, CMS began the process of re-building the number of facilities in the SFF program; however, according to CMS officials, the process would be slow, and as of August 2018 there were 85 SFFs. In 2015, CMS said some of the reductions to oversight activities were in response to an increase in oversight responsibilities and limited number of staff and financial resources. Specifically, CMS officials said increasing oversight responsibilities and a limited number of staff and financial resources at the central, regional, and state levels required the agency to evaluate its activities and reduce the scope of some activities. In the October 2015 report, we recommended CMS monitor oversight modifications to better assess their effects; HHS agreed with the recommendation and told us they are beginning to take steps to address this issue. We maintain the importance of monitoring to help CMS better understand how its oversight modifications affect nursing home quality and to improve its oversight given limited resources.

To help ensure nursing home residents receive quality care, CMS defines quality standards that homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To monitor compliance with these standards, CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies to conduct on-site surveys of the state's homes and also collects other data on nursing home quality. Although CMS and others have reported some potential improvements in nursing home quality, questions have been raised about nursing home quality and weaknesses in CMS oversight. This statement summarizes GAO's October 2015 report, GAO-16-33 . Specifically, it describes (1) trends in nursing home quality through 2014, and (2) changes CMS had made to its oversight activities as of October 2015. It also includes the status of GAO's recommendations associated with these findings. GAO recently obtained information from CMS officials about steps they have taken to implement the 2015 GAO recommendations. GAO's October 2015 report found mixed results in nursing home quality based on its analysis of trends reflected in key sources of quality data that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) collects. An increase in reported consumer complaints suggested that consumers' concerns about nursing home quality increased. In contrast, trends in care deficiencies, nurse staffing levels, and clinical quality measures indicated potential improvement in nursing home quality. GAO also found that data issues complicated CMS's ability to assess nursing home quality trends. For example: CMS allowed states to use different survey methodologies to measure deficiencies in nursing home care, which complicates the ability to make comparisons nationwide. GAO recommended that CMS implement a standardized survey methodology across states, and in November 2017 CMS completed national implementation. CMS did not regularly audit selected quality data including nurse staffing and clinical data (for example, on residents with pressure ulcers) to ensure their accuracy. GAO recommended CMS implement a plan for ongoing auditing of quality data. The agency concurred with this recommendation and has been conducting regular audits of nurse staffing data but does not have a plan to audit other quality data on a continuing basis. GAO continues to believe that regular audits are needed to ensure the accuracy and comparability of nursing home quality data. GAO's October 2015 report found that CMS had made numerous modifications to its nursing home oversight activities. However, CMS had not monitored how the modifications might affect its ability to assess nursing home quality. GAO found that some modifications expanded or added new activities—such as creating new training for state surveyors on unnecessary medication usage—while others reduced existing activities. For example, CMS reduced the number of nursing homes participating in the Special Focus Facility program—which provides additional oversight of certain homes with a history of poor performance—by over half from 2013 to 2014. CMS officials told GAO that some of the reductions to oversight activities were in response to an increase in oversight responsibilities and a limited number of staff and financial resources. To help ensure modifications do not adversely affect CMS's ability to assess nursing home quality, GAO recommended that CMS monitor modifications of essential oversight activities to better understand the effects on nursing home quality oversight. CMS concurred with this recommendation and told us it has begun to take steps to address it. Such monitoring is important for CMS to better understand how its oversight modifications affect nursing home quality and to improve its oversight given limited resources."], "length": 2983, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "06b7e18cf06f5e69ec00eac07af44f2f895ef671a07b0a5b"}
{"input": "", "context": "For over a decade, each of VA’s 170 medical centers used VHA’s legacy MSPV program to order medical supplies, such as bandages and scalpels. Many of those items were purchased using the Federal Supply Schedules, which provided medical centers with a great deal of flexibility. However, as we reported in 2016, this legacy program prevented VHA from standardizing items used across its medical centers and affected its ability to leverage its buying power to achieve greater cost avoidance. Standardization is a process of narrowing the range of items purchased to meet a given need, such as buying 10 varieties of bandages instead of 100, in order to improve buying power, simplify supply chain management, and provide clinical consistency. In part because of the legacy MSPV program’s limited standardization, VHA decided to transition to a new iteration, called MSPV-NG. The transition to MSPV-NG has been a major effort, involving the MSPV- NG program office, stakeholders from the VHA’s Procurement and Logistics Office and VA’s Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC)—a VA-wide contracting organization—and logistics and clinical personnel at every medical center. The program also includes hundreds of new contracts with individual supply vendors and a new set of prime vendor contracts to distribute the supplies. VA’s goals for the MSPV-NG program include (1) standardizing requirements for supply items for greater clinical consistency; (2) demonstrating cost avoidance by leveraging VA’s substantial buying power when making competitive awards; (3) achieving greater efficiency in ordering and supply chain management, including a metric of ordering 40 percent of medical centers’ supplies from the MSPV-NG formulary; and (4) involving clinicians in requirements development to ensure uniform clinical review of medical supplies. VHA launched the MSPV-NG program in December 2016, but allowed a 4-month transition period. After April 2017, medical centers could no longer use the legacy program. MSPV-NG now restricts ordering to a narrow formulary. VHA policy requires medical centers to use MSPV- NG—as opposed to other means such as open market purchase card transactions—when purchasing items that are available in the formulary. Leading hospital networks we spoke with have similar goals to VA in managing their supply chains, including clinical standardization and reduced costs. These hospital networks reported they analyze their spending to identify items purchased most frequently, and which ones would be the best candidates to standardize first to yield cost savings. The hospitals’ supply chain managers reported establishing consensus with clinicians through early and frequent collaboration, understanding that clinician involvement is critical to the success of any effort to standardize their medical supply chain. By following these practices, these hospital networks have reported they have achieved significant cost savings in some cases, and the potential for improved patient care, while maintaining buy-in from their clinicians. VHA’s implementation of the MSPV-NG program—from its initial work to identify a list of supply requirements in early 2015, through its roll-out of the formulary to medical centers in December 2016—was not executed in line with leading practices. Specifically, VHA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the transition that, if in place, could have facilitated buy-in for the change throughout the organization. Further, the initial requirements development process and tight time frames contributed to ineffective contracting processes. As a result, VHA developed an initial formulary that did not meet the needs of the medical centers and has yet to achieve utilization and cost avoidance goals. VA made some changes in the second phase of requirements development to address deficiencies identified in the initial roll out. Key among these was to increase the level of clinical involvement, that is, to obtain input from the doctors and nurses at VA’s individual medical facilities. Despite changes aimed at improving implementation, the agency continues to face challenges that prevent the program from fully achieving its goals. VA did not document a clear overall strategy for the MSPV-NG program at the start and has not done so to date. About 6 months after our initial requests for a strategy or plan, a VHA official provided us with an October 2015 plan focusing on the mechanics of establishing the MSPV-NG formulary. However, this plan was used only within the VHA Procurement and Logistics Office and had not been approved by VHA or VA leadership. Leading practices for organizational transformation state that agencies must have well-documented plans and strategies for major initiatives (such as MSPV-NG) and communicate them clearly and consistently to all involved—which included VHA headquarters, the SAC, and all 170 medical centers. Without such a strategy, VA could not reasonably ensure that all stakeholders understood VHA’s approach for MSPV-NG and worked together in a coordinated manner to achieve program goals. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the Director of the MSPV-NG program office should, with input from SAC, develop, document, and communicate to stakeholders an overarching strategy for the program, including how the program office will prioritize categories of supplies for future phases of requirement development and contracting. VA agreed with this recommendation and reported it would have a strategy in place by December 2017. Leadership instability and workforce challenges also made it difficult for VA to execute its transition to MSPV-NG. Our work has shown that leadership buy-in is necessary to ensure that major programs like MSPV- NG have the resources and support they need to execute their missions. Due to a combination of budget and hiring constraints, and lack of prioritization within VA, the MSPV-NG program office has never been fully staffed and has experienced instability in its leadership. As of January 2017, 24 of the office’s 40 positions were filled, and program office officials stated that this lack of staff affected their ability to implement certain aspects of the program within the planned time frames. In addition, since the inception of MSPV-NG, the program office has had four directors, two of whom were acting and two of whom were fulfilling the director position while performing other collateral duties. For instance, one of the acting MSPV-NG program office directors was on detail from a regional health network to fulfill the position, but had to abruptly leave and return to her prior position due to a federal hiring freeze. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that VHA prioritize the hiring of a MSPV- NG program director on a permanent basis. VA agreed with this recommendation and indicated a vacancy announcement will be posted by the end of 2017. The MSPV-NG program office initially developed requirements for items to be included in the formulary based almost exclusively on prior supply purchases, with limited clinician involvement. The program office concluded in its October 2015 formulary plan that relying on data from previous clinician purchases would be a good representation of medical centers’ needs and that clinician input would not be required for identifying which items to include in the initial formulary. Further, rather than standardizing purchases of specific categories of supplies—such as bandages or scalpels—program officials told us they identified medical and surgical items on which VA had spent $16,000 or more annually and ordered at least 12 times per year, and made those items the basis for the formulary. Officials said this analysis initially yielded a list of about 18,000 items, which the program office further refined to about 6,000 items by removing duplicate items or those that were not considered consumable commodities, such as medical equipment. This approach to requirements development stood in sharp contrast to those of the leading hospital networks we met with, which rely heavily on clinician input to help drive the standardization process and focus on individual categories of supplies that provide the best opportunities for cost savings. Based on the requirements developed by the program office, SAC began to issue competitive solicitations for the 6,000 items on the initial formulary in June 2015. Medical supply companies had responded to about 30 percent of the solicitations as of January 2016. As a result, according to SAC officials, they conducted outreach and some of these companies responded that VHA’s requirements did not appear to be based on clinical input and instead consisted of manufacturer-specific requirements that favored particular products instead of broader descriptions. Furthermore, SAC did not solicit large groups of related items, but rather issued separate solicitations for small groups of supply items—consisting of three or fewer items. This is contrary to industry practices of soliciting large groups of related supplies together. Therefore, according to SAC officials, some medical supply companies told them that submitting responses to SAC’s solicitations required more time and resources than they were willing to commit. By its April 2016 deadline for having 6,000 items on the formulary, SAC had been working on the effort for over a year and had established competitive agreements for about 200 items, representing about 3 percent of the planned items. Without contracts for the items on the formulary in place, VA delayed the launch of the MSPV-NG program until December 2016 and SAC began establishing non-competitive agreements in the last few months before the launch of MSPV-NG. As shown in figure 1, these non-competitive agreements accounted for approximately 79 percent of the items on the January 2017 version of the formulary. While this approach enabled the MSPV-NG program office to establish the formulary more quickly, it did so at the expense of one of the primary goals of the MSPV-NG program—leveraging VA’s buying power to obtain cost avoidance through competition. Once VA’s MSPV-NG initial formulary was established in December 2016, each medical center was charged with implementing it. According to logistics officials we spoke with at selected medical centers, they had varying levels of success due, in part, to incomplete guidance from the program office. Without clear guidance, many medical centers reported they were unable to find direct matches or substitutes on the MSPV-NG formulary for a substantial number of items they routinely used, which negatively impacted utilization rates for the initial formulary. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the Director of the MSPV- NG program office provide complete guidance to medical centers for matching equivalent supply items. VA agreed with this recommendation and indicated it would provide this guidance to medical centers by December 2017. According to SAC, as of June 2017, only about a third of the items on the initial version of the formulary were being ordered in any significant quantity by medical centers, indicating that many items on the formulary were not those that are needed by medical centers. Senior VHA acquisition officials attributed this mismatch to shortcomings in their initial requirements development process as well as with VA’s purchase data. VA had set a target that medical centers would order 40 percent of their supplies from the MSPV-NG formulary, but utilization rates were below this target with a nationwide average utilization rate across medical centers of about 24 percent as of May 2017. Specifically, Chief Supply Chain Officers—who are responsible for managing the ordering and stocking of medical supplies at six selected medical centers—told us that many items they needed were not included in the MSPV-NG formulary. As such, we found that these six medical centers generally fell below VA’s stated utilization target. As shown in figure 2, among the six selected medical centers we reviewed, one met the target, while the remaining five were below 25 percent utilization. Instead of fully using MSPV-NG, the selected medical centers are purchasing many items through other means, such as purchase cards or new contracts awarded by their local contracting office, in part, because they said the formulary does not meet their needs. These approaches run counter to the goals of the MSPV-NG program and contribute to VA not making the best use of taxpayer dollars. Greater utilization of MSPV-NG is essential to VA achieving the cost avoidance goal of $150 million for its supply chain transformation effort. Under the legacy MSPV program, the National Acquisition Center tracked cost avoidance achieved by comparing prices for competitively-awarded MSPV supply contracts with prices available elsewhere. However, VHA officials stated that they are not currently tracking cost avoidance related specifically to MSPV-NG. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the VHA Chief Procurement and Logistics Officer, in coordination with SAC, should calculate cost avoidance achieved by MSPV-NG on an ongoing basis. VA agreed with this recommendation and reported it would develop a new metric to measure cost avoidance by June 2018. In Phase 2 of MSPV-NG, the program office has taken some steps to incorporate greater clinical involvement in subsequent requirements development, but both its requirements development and SAC’s contracting efforts have been hampered by staffing and schedule constraints. In the fall of 2016, the program office began to establish panels of clinicians to serve on MSPV-NG integrated product teams (IPT) assigned to the task of developing updated requirements for the second phase of the formulary. Program officials said they had difficulty recruiting clinicians to participate. We found that slightly more than half (20 of the 38) of the IPTs had begun their work to review items and develop updated requirements by the time the MSPV-NG program launched in December 2016. Staff on the IPTs had to complete their responsibilities by the end of March 2017 while simultaneously managing their regular workload as physicians, surgeons, or nurses. By early March 2017, the IPTs still had about 4,200 items to review. Faced with meeting this unrealistic time frame, the MSPV-NG program office had 9 IPT members travel to one location—with an additional 10 members participating virtually—to meet for 5 days to review the remaining items. Members told us that this time pressure limited the extent to which they were able to pursue the goal of standardizing supplies, and that their review ended up being more of a data validation exercise than a standardization review. VHA ultimately met this compressed timeline, but in a rushed manner that limited the impact of clinician involvement. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the VHA Chief Procurement and Logistics Officer use input from national clinical program offices to prioritize its requirements development and standardization efforts beyond Phase 2 to focus on supply categories that offer the best opportunity for standardization and cost avoidance. VA agreed with this recommendation and stated it is in the process of finalizing guidance that will detail the importance of involving the national clinical program offices in MSPV-NG requirements development and standardization efforts. The SAC plans to replace the existing Phase 1 non-competitive agreements with competitive awards based on the Phase 2 requirements generated by the IPTs, but it may not be able to keep up with expiring agreements due to an unrealistic schedule. Because they were made on a non-competitive basis, the Phase 1 agreements were established for a period of 1 year. In order to keep the full formulary available, the SAC director said the staff must award 200 to 250 contracts before the Phase 1 agreements expire later this year. SAC officials acknowledged that it is unlikely that they will be able to award the contracts by the time the existing agreements expire. According to SAC officials, they are in the process of hiring more staff to deal with the increased workload. Further, the SAC division director told us that they canceled all outstanding Phase 2 solicitations in September 2017 due to low response rates, protests from service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and changes in overall MSPV-NG strategy. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the MSPV-NG program office and SAC should establish a plan for how to mitigate the potential risk of gaps in contract coverage while SAC is still working to make competitive Phase 2 awards, which could include prioritizing supply categories that are most likely to yield cost avoidance. VA agreed with this recommendation and indicated it has developed a plan to mitigate the risk of gaps in contract coverage with short- and mid-term procurement strategies to ensure continued provision of medical and surgical supplies to VHA facilities. The department also stated that it plans to replace the current MSPV-NG contract and formulary process with a new approach where the prime vendor would develop the formulary. However, VA will likely face challenges in this new approach until it fully addresses the existing shortcomings in the MSPV-NG program.

To provide a more efficient, cost-effective way for its medical centers to order supplies, the VA established the MSPV-NG program. The program's goals include involving clinicians in requirements development, leveraging buying power when making competitive awards, and consolidating supplies used across medical centers. VA began developing requirements in early 2015 and launched the program in December 2016. This testimony summarizes key information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, GAO-18-34 . Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements. (See figure). As a result, the program did not meet the needs of medical centers, and usage remained below VA's 40 percent target. (See figure.) VA has taken steps to address some deficiencies and is developing a new approach to the program. However, VA will likely continue to face challenges in meeting its goals until it fully addresses these existing shortcomings.

{"input": "", "context": "SSA has in recent years relied on advocates for individuals with certain diseases and disorders to bring potential CAL conditions to its attention. However, SSA has not clearly communicated this or provided guidance on how to make suggestions through its CAL webpage, which communicates information to the public. Without more explicit instructions, we noted that advocates may not present information that is relevant for SSA’s decision-making or that most strongly makes the case for these conditions to be included on the CAL list. One representative from an advocacy organization, for example, described meeting with agency officials and being surprised by SSA’s focus on cancer grades— an indicator of how quickly cancer is likely to grow and spread—as she was not accustomed to discussing the condition she represents in these terms. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality information to achieve their objectives. We concluded that absent clear guidance to advocates on how to make suggestions through its CAL webpage, SSA is missing an opportunity to gather quality information to inform its selection of CAL conditions. In addition, we found that relying on advocates to bring conditions to SSA’s attention also introduces potential bias toward certain conditions and the possibility of missing others. Some conditions that are potentially deserving of CAL consideration may not have advocacy organizations affiliated with them, and some advocates may be unaware of CAL. As a result, some conditions may have a better chance of being considered than other, equally deserving ones that are not proposed, and individuals with those conditions may have to wait longer to receive approval for disability benefits. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should collect complete and unbiased information and consider the reliability of their information sources. According to some external researchers who work with SSA, an approach leveraging SSA’s administrative data may help address the bias that is introduced by only using advocates. SSA has contracted with the National Institutes of Health and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for research using SSA administrative data, which has led to the identification of potential CAL conditions. However, we noted that to date, the research SSA has contracted has not been sufficiently targeted to generate more than a small number of additions to the CAL list. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA develop a formal and systematic approach to gathering information to identify potential conditions for the CAL list, including sharing information through SSA’s website on how to propose conditions for the list and using research that is directly applicable to identifying CAL conditions. SSA agreed with this recommendation and has begun to make revisions to its website. We also found that SSA has also not consistently communicated with advocates who have suggested conditions to add to the CAL list about the status of their recommendations, leading to uncertainty for some. SSA officials told us that they provide a written or oral response to advocacy organizations that have suggested a condition for inclusion on the CAL list to inform them whether the condition is approved. However, some of the advocates we spoke to had not received such a response from SSA and found it challenging to connect with SSA officials to obtain information about the status of their suggestions. For example, one representative from an advocacy organization told us that she was unable to reach SSA officials to obtain any information on the status of her suggestion despite repeated attempts. In the absence of a response from SSA, she had resubmitted her condition and supporting documents to SSA every six months for three years since her initial submission in 2014. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should communicate quality information externally so that external parties can help the agency achieve its objectives. We concluded that without two- way communication between SSA and advocates, advocates are unclear on the status of their proposed CAL conditions and SSA may be missing an opportunity to improve the quality of the information it obtains from advocates. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA develop formal procedures for consistently notifying those who propose conditions for the CAL list of the status of their proposals. SSA agreed with this recommendation. Our review also found that SSA has not developed or communicated clear, consistent criteria for deciding which potential conditions will be included on the CAL list. Officials told us that they have informally considered criteria such as allowance rates—the percentage of claimants asserting a certain condition who are approved for benefits—when identifying potential CAL conditions. However, we reviewed 31 assessments of potential CAL conditions prepared by SSA medical consultants and found that they did not cite consistent criteria. There was no standard format used for these reports, and SSA does not have a template, checklist, or guidance—other than the medical listings—that its staff consult when preparing them. Further, SSA officials have cited different reasons for not designating conditions as CAL in communications with those who proposed conditions, which led to confusion regarding CAL condition criteria for staff from some advocacy organizations we interviewed. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should define objectives in specific and measurable terms so that they are understood at all levels of the agency and performance toward achieving these objectives can be assessed. To help achieve these objectives, the standards state that agencies should also communicate key information to their internal and external stakeholders. We concluded that absent clear criteria for designating CAL conditions, advocates and other stakeholders may be confused as to why some conditions are not included on the CAL list and SSA may miss conditions that could qualify for CAL. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA develop and communicate internally and externally criteria for selecting conditions for the CAL list. SSA agreed with this recommendation. To identify disability claims for expedited CAL processing, SSA primarily relies on software that searches for key words in claims. However, because text provided by claimants may be ambiguous, incomplete, inaccurate, or misspelled, the software is hindered in its ability to flag all claimants with CAL conditions and may also flag claimants for CAL processing that should not be flagged. For example, officials we interviewed at 5 of the 6 selected DDS offices said that they have seen claims inaccurately flagged for CAL when the claim text included words like “family history of ” though the CAL condition was not asserted by the claimant. In addition, in our claim file review, we found a claimant asserting a leiomyosarcoma, a soft tissue cancerous tumor that may be found in organs including the liver, lungs, and uterus, who misspelled the term as “leiomysarcoma” on the disability claim, which resulted in the software not flagging the claim as CAL, although liver and lung cancers are CAL conditions. SSA officials told us that they have not established a feedback loop to capture observations from DDS officials on weaknesses in the software. However, DDS officials we spoke with have observed weaknesses in the software that, if shared, could assist SSA in improving its accuracy in identifying CAL claims. For example, an official at one DDS office noted that the software appears to identify CAL conditions using words from the claim text out of order or without regard to specific phrases. Specifically, the official stated that some claims with “pancreatitis” or “pancreatic pain” have been incorrectly flagged for the CAL condition “pancreatic cancer.” According to federal internal control standards, quality information about the agency’s operational processes should flow up the reporting lines from personnel to management to help management achieve the agency’s objectives. We concluded that absent a mechanism to gather feedback from DDS offices nationwide, the agency may be missing an opportunity to obtain important information that could help improve the software. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA take steps to obtain information that can help refine the selection software for CAL claims, for example by using management data, research, or DDS office feedback. SSA agreed with this recommendation. We also found that DDS offices play an important role in helping to ensure that claims are accurately flagged for CAL by manually correcting flagging errors made by the software, but SSA’s guidance on how to make such corrections does not address when they should occur. For example, instructions on the mechanical process for removing the flag based on the DDS examiner’s review of the medical evidence in the claimant’s file does not indicate how quickly this should be done after CAL status is clarified. Based on our discussions with officials in the 6 selected DDS offices, we found that some examiners did not understand the importance of making timely changes to a CAL flag designation to ensure faster claim processing and accurate tracking of CAL claims. For example, examiners at one DDS office said that they do not always add or remove a CAL flag when they determine a claim is erroneously designated because it adds another step to claim processing and the step seems unnecessary. Ensuring claims are correctly flagged for or not flagged for CAL is important because the CAL flag reduces DDS processing time by about 10 weeks on average compared to the processing time for all claims, according to SSA data. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should record transactions in an accurate and timely fashion, and communicate quality information throughout the agency. We concluded that without clear guidance on when to make manual changes, DDS examiners may continue to take actions that are not timely and may hinder expedited processing and accurate tracking of CAL claims. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA clarify written policies and procedures regarding when manual addition and removal of CAL flags should occur on individual claims. SSA agreed with this recommendation. In addition, our analysis of SSA’s data shows that DDS offices varied in their use of manual actions to add the CAL flag to claims that were not initially flagged for CAL by the software. Specifically, we found that over half of DDS offices nationwide that processed disability claims in fiscal year 2016 had one or zero claims with a manually added CAL designation in that year. In comparison, 5 DDS offices together accounted for over 50 percent of all claims with a manual addition. Such variance could result in some claimants who assert a CAL condition not receiving expedited processing because their claims were not flagged for CAL by the selection software or DDS examiners. We found that because SSA had not undertaken a study of its manual action procedures on such claims, it was unclear why this variance existed among DDS offices. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor operations and evaluate results. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA assess the reasons why the uses of manual actions vary across DDS offices. SSA agreed with this recommendation. In our August 2017 report, we found that SSA has taken some steps to ensure the accuracy and consistency of decisions on CAL claims, including developing detailed descriptions of CAL conditions, known as impairment summaries, but has not regularly updated the summaries. These summaries suggest specific medical evidence for the DDS examiner to obtain to verify the claimant’s asserted CAL condition and help examiners make decisions about whether to allow or deny a claim. However, we found that because SSA has not regularly updated the impairment summaries, nearly one-third are 5 or more years old. Several advocates (4 of 6) and medical experts (2 of 3) we interviewed suggested that the impairment summaries should be updated every 1 to 3 years because medical research and advancements may have implications for disability determinations. In addition, federal internal control standards state that as changes in the agency’s environment occur, management should make necessary changes to the information requirements to address the modified risks. We concluded that given the pace of medical research for certain CAL conditions, in the absence of a systematic and regular mechanism to update CAL impairment summaries, SSA potentially faces the risk of making inaccurate and inconsistent disability determinations based on outdated information. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA develop a schedule and a plan for updates to the CAL impairment summaries to ensure that information is medically up to date. SSA agreed with this recommendation. We also found that SSA does not leverage data it collects to identify potential challenges to accurate and consistent decision-making on CAL claims. SSA and DDS officials review some data to monitor CAL claims processing, such as the total number of CAL claims and claims flagged for CAL by the selection software, but these efforts do not address the accuracy and consistency of decisions on CAL claims. In contrast, our analysis of SSA’s data on outcomes for claims with asserted CAL conditions suggested that a review of data on allowance and denial rates for these claims may help identify conditions that are challenging to accurately and consistently adjudicate. For example, while the vast majority of claims asserting CAL conditions are allowed—about 92 percent were approved in fiscal year 2016—data we reviewed showed that there was a lower percentage of claims allowed for certain asserted CAL conditions. Specifically, SSA denied more than 30 percent of claims asserting 37 CAL conditions, and 17 of these conditions had denial rates that were greater than 50 percent. Advocates we spoke to who represent some of these conditions explained why challenges adjudicating these claims may exist. For example, officials from one of these advocacy groups told us that the CAL condition they represent is frequently confused with a much more common and non-life threatening condition that is less likely to be allowed. According to federal internal control standards, management should obtain relevant data based on identified information requirements, process these data into quality information that can be used to make informed decisions, and evaluate the agency’s performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks. We concluded that without regular analyses of available data, SSA is missing an opportunity to ensure the accuracy and consistency of CAL decision-making. In our August 2017 report, we recommended that SSA develop a plan to regularly review and use available data to assess the accuracy and consistency of CAL decision-making. SSA agreed with this recommendation. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Larson, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

Since then, SSA has expanded its list of CAL conditions from 50 to 225. This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's August 2017 report entitled SSA's Compassionate Allowance Initiative: Improvements Needed to Make Expedited Processing of Disability Claims More Consistent and Accurate , GAO-17-625 . It examines the extent to which SSA has procedures for (1) identifying conditions for the CAL list; (2) identifying claims for CAL processing; and (3) ensuring the accuracy and consistency of CAL decisions. For its August 2017 report, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed SSA data on disability decisions for CAL claims from fiscal years 2009 through 2016 and on CAL claims with manual actions in fiscal year 2016; reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 74 claim files with fiscal year 2016 initial determinations; and interviewed medical experts, representatives from patient advocacy groups, and SSA officials in headquarters and six DDS offices selected for geographic dispersion and varied CAL caseloads. The Social Security Administration (SSA) does not have a formal or systematic approach for designating certain medical conditions for the Compassionate Allowance initiative (CAL). CAL was established in 2008 to fast-track through the disability determination process claimants who are likely to be approved because they have certain eligible medical conditions. SSA has in recent years relied on advocates for individuals with certain diseases and disorders to bring conditions to its attention for potential inclusion in CAL. However, by relying on advocates, SSA may overlook disabling conditions that have no advocates, potentially resulting in individuals with these conditions not receiving expedited processing. Further, SSA does not have clear, consistent criteria for designating conditions for potential CAL inclusion, which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards. As a result, external stakeholders lack key information about how to recommend conditions for inclusion on the CAL list. To identify disability claims for expedited CAL processing, SSA primarily relies on software that searches for key words in claims. However, if claimants include incorrect or misspelled information in their claims the software is hindered in its ability to flag all claimants with CAL conditions or may flag claimants for CAL processing that should not be flagged. SSA has guidance for disability determination services (DDS) staff on how to manually correct errors made by the software, but the guidance does not address when such corrections should occur. Without clear guidance on when to make manual changes, DDS examiners may not take timely actions and may hinder expedited processing for appropriate claims. SSA has taken some steps to ensure the accuracy and consistency of decisions on CAL claims, including developing detailed descriptions of CAL conditions, known as impairment summaries. These summaries help examiners make decisions about whether to allow or deny a claim. However, nearly one-third of the summaries are 5 or more years old. Experts and advocates that GAO spoke to suggested that summaries should be updated every 1 to 3 years to reduce the risk of SSA making disability determinations using medically outdated information. In addition, GAO found that SSA does not leverage data it collects to identify potential challenges to accurate and consistent decision-making on CAL claims. Without regular analyses of available data, SSA is missing an opportunity to ensure the accuracy and consistency of CAL decision-making. In its August 2017 report, GAO made eight recommendations, including that SSA develop a process to systematically gather information on potential CAL conditions, communicate criteria for designating CAL conditions, clarify guidance for manual corrections on CAL claims, update CAL impairment summaries, and use available data to ensure accurate, consistent decision-making. SSA agreed with all of GAO's recommendations."], "length": 3156, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a4d57f54f9f3a810aa558a4a3895407987f77ee8d3642b3c"}
{"input": "", "context": "To participate in federal student aid programs, postsecondary schools must be 1) certified by Education as eligible to participate in federal student aid programs, 2) accredited by a recognized accrediting agency— generally nongovernmental, nonprofit entities—and 3) authorized by the state in which the school is physically located. (See table 1.) FSA is responsible for ensuring that schools with access to federal student aid are eligible and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds, according to standards established by Education and authorized by the Higher Education Act. These standards include requirements for schools related to communication, personnel, policies, procedures and reporting, and adequate checks and balances in a system of internal controls, among others. FSA is also responsible for conducting ongoing financial oversight of schools that receive federal student aid. This includes reviewing annual financial statement audits to assess a school’s financial responsibility and providing additional oversight to schools that do not meet financial responsibility standards outlined in the Higher Education Act. Schools that participate in federal student aid programs generally are required to submit annual compliance audits. The compliance audit provides information that FSA can use to assess the school’s administration of federal student aid programs and to identify schools that require additional oversight because they do not fully comply with federal student aid administrative requirements. The OIG is required to assess the quality of school compliance audits and selects a sample to review each year. The OIG reviews the audit documentation to ensure that it supports the auditor’s opinions and that the audit results are reliable. According to agency guidance, FSA staff should refer compliance audits to the OIG for a quality review if they have any concerns about the quality of the audits. Both FSA and OIG officials stated that the OIG has primary responsibility for issues related to audit quality. When a school first applies to be certified to administer federal student aid, FSA will either approve the school for provisional certification— generally for 1 year—or deny certification (see fig. 1). Once a school is approved for initial certification and applies for recertification, FSA will provisionally or fully recertify the school, or deny certification. According to FSA procedures, FSA uses provisional certification for initial, or first time, applicants, as well as schools that are applying for recertification. Provisional certification is the only approval status available to new schools. In addition, FSA may decide to recertify a school provisionally if it determines that a school has not fully complied with federal student aid requirements. FSA prohibits provisionally certified schools from opening new campus locations or offering new programs without approval from FSA, and provisionally certified schools that are denied recertification have a less substantive appeals process than fully certified schools. Further, recertified schools in provisional status are subject to more FSA oversight than schools that are fully certified. FSA procedures allow for some discretion in determining for how long to certify a school. Provisional recertification generally lasts 1 to 3 years, while full recertification generally lasts 4 to 6 years. Education’s FSA regional staff draw information from a variety of sources during the certification process to assess a school’s capability to administer federal student aid. According to FSA documents, regional staff are to review information collected from schools and third parties, such as annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors, among other information sources. FSA staff responsible for different functional areas, such as financial and compliance audits, accreditation status, and student loan default rates, compile and review information on schools, according to FSA procedures. FSA officials told us that these staff meet to discuss any potential program eligibility issues and to ensure that all information relevant to a school is considered before making a certification decision. FSA’s certification procedures outline some of the key information that regional staff should assess, some of which is relevant to both initial and recertification decisions, and some of which is specific to each type of certification process (see fig. 2). Documents and policies provided by schools: FSA regional staff are directed to review documents submitted by schools, including school catalogs, and certain school policies—such as admissions and student refund policies—that are relevant to assessing administrative capability. Proof of accreditation: School accreditors are responsible for applying and enforcing standards to help ensure that the education offered by schools is of sufficient quality to achieve program objectives. Accreditation of schools, which generally includes a site visit, takes place on a cycle that may range from every few years to as many as 10 years. Proof of state authorization: States are responsible for authorizing schools to offer postsecondary education and respond to student complaints. The process for approving schools varies from state to state and may include on-site visits. Audited financial statements: FSA regional staff are directed to review information in audited financial statements to assess schools’ financial health. Schools are required to have annual audited financial statements issued by an independent certified public accountant or a government auditor. Self-reported school data: FSA regional staff are instructed to review data on continual student enrollment in eligible academic programs and student withdrawal rates. Pre-certification review and school outreach: FSA staff are responsible for contacting school personnel to verify the school’s application information and discuss relevant policies, procedures, and other materials relevant to administering federal student aid. FSA visits to newly certified schools: After schools first apply and are provisionally certified, Education requires FSA regional staff to contact them within 3 months and schedule an on-site school visit. Schools cannot administer federal student aid until they are certified, so FSA has limited information on how newly certified schools are administering federal student aid programs. School visits provide FSA with an opportunity to collect additional information about a provisionally certified school’s ability to administer federal student aid. Some FSA regional staff we interviewed told us that on-site visits to newly certified schools provide valuable first-hand information about whether these schools are administering federal student aid in accordance with program requirements. If FSA regional staff find that a school is having difficulties administering federal student aid, FSA procedures direct regional staff to assist schools by providing clarification and guidance on federal student aid policies, recommending additional training for school officials, and helping schools develop a plan to track and report on their corrective actions, among other things. Compliance audits: FSA staff are directed to review information in compliance audits to determine if schools are complying with specific federal student aid requirements. Generally, compliance audits are required to be conducted annually by an independent auditor, and submitted with the school’s audited financial statements. Program reviews: FSA regional staff are also responsible for conducting program reviews, usually on site, which evaluate school compliance with federal requirements and can provide more in-depth information on schools than compliance audits, according to some FSA staff we interviewed. Generally, FSA selects schools for program reviews that it considers to be at risk for noncompliance, according to Education documents. FSA conducts approximately 250 to 300 program reviews per year, according to FSA documentation. FSA staff from all four of our selected regional offices told us they consider results from any recent program review in decisions about recertification and noted that such information, when available, is valuable for assessing schools’ administrative capability. Education data: FSA regional office staff are also directed to review data on student loan default rates. From calendar years 2006 through 2017, FSA approved most schools applying for certification to receive federal student aid, according to Education data. From 2006 through 2017, FSA approved 89 percent of schools new to administering federal student aid for provisional certification and denied 11 percent of schools overall (see fig. 3). Denial rates for initial certification were 11 percent for public and for-profit schools and 14 percent for nonprofit schools. For more information on 2006-2017 school certification outcomes by year, see appendix I. FSA regional staff responsible for reviewing school applications told us that schools are denied initial certification for issues such as a lack of accreditation, not offering eligible programs for federal student aid, or not meeting other statutory eligibility requirements. For example, FSA staff said that for-profit and vocational schools that apply for initial certification are required to provide an eligible program continuously for 2 years prior to their initial application. FSA staff may also advise schools that do not meet basic eligibility requirements not to apply, which could result in fewer initial certification denials overall. In addition, FSA staff said they often work with schools to address compliance problems, for example, by providing guidance on revising school policies that do not meet requirements, so that the schools are able to meet FSA’s certification requirements. From 2006 through 2017, 76 percent of schools applying for recertification were fully recertified, 21 percent were provisionally recertified, and 3 percent were denied recertification. Sixty-six percent of for-profit schools were fully recertified, 28 percent were provisionally recertified, and 6 percent were denied. In comparison, 86 percent of public schools were fully recertified, 14 percent were provisionally recertified, and fewer than 1 percent were denied. Nonprofit schools had rates similar to public schools, with 80 percent fully recertified, 18 percent provisionally recertified, and 2 percent denied (see fig 4). FSA staff from all four of our selected regional offices told us that they typically deny recertification when a school no longer meets eligibility requirements, such as losing accreditation, or when there is significant evidence of serious issues or massive wrongdoing, such as fraud. For example, managers in one regional office told us they denied recertification for a school because they had evidence that the school was accepting students without valid high school diplomas and referring them to diploma mills to boost enrollment. Staff in two FSA regional offices told us that they can also choose to fully recertify a school for shorter periods of time if they uncover issues related to administrative capability. For example, one regional staff member told us that when they found a school’s default rate for one federal student loan program had been high for the prior 3 years, the regional office decided to shorten the school’s full recertification period from 6 to 4 years, to allow FSA staff to review the school again sooner. FSA staff from all four of our selected regional offices told us that they provisionally certify schools for a variety of reasons, including when a school submits a late compliance audit or when a recent compliance audit indicates that a school could potentially have significant problems. Generally, schools in provisional certification status are subject to additional monitoring by FSA compared to schools that have been fully certified. For example, Education officials said that if they have concerns about a provisionally certified school’s student withdrawal rate, they can add provisional conditions requiring the school to submit monthly enrollment rosters for review. Staff in two FSA regional offices told us that in other cases, if they have concerns about how a school is administering federal student aid or suspected fraud, they can put a school on provisional status and conduct a program review to collect more detailed information on compliance with federal requirements. Education data also show that most schools remain in provisional status the first time they are recertified—62 percent from 2006 to 2017. In contrast, FSA staff fully recertified over three-quarters of schools that applied for recertification a second time during the same time period (see table 2). For more information on first and second recertification outcomes by school sector, see appendix II. We found that FSA generally relies on compliance audits as the only annual on-site review to determine how schools applying for recertification administer federal student aid. The audits provide direct information collected by independent auditors from school visits and file reviews examining how schools administer federal student aid and comply with program requirements. For example, OIG audit guidance directs auditors to check whether schools are distributing federal student aid to eligible students and accurately calculating student loan amounts. FSA officials and staff from all four of our selected regional offices said that compliance audits are a key source of information they use to assess a school’s administrative capability. Officials from Education’s OIG said that the quality of information in compliance audits varies substantially and depends on the auditor. The OIG has found quality problems in some of the compliance audits it selects—based on auditor and school risk factors—for its annual quality control reviews. Because the OIG selects higher risk audits to review, its reviews are more likely to detect problems, and OIG officials said they cannot make any conclusions about the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. However, our analysis of OIG quality review data found that of the 739 compliance audits reviewed by the OIG from fiscal years 2006 through 2017, the OIG passed 23 percent (173) and failed 59 percent (436). An additional 18 percent (130) passed with deficiencies. For example, across the 41 compliance audits it reviewed in fiscal year 2016, the OIG identified 264 quality deficiencies with the auditor’s work, according to our analysis of quality reviews provided by the OIG. The most frequently cited issues in these 41 audits were: reporting (24 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor tested whether the school correctly reported student enrollment status; student eligibility (20 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor verified student school attendance; and administrative capability (19 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor determined whether the accreditor had been notified about a change in school ownership within 10 days. FSA officials also identified quality issues with the compliance audits of some schools. FSA headquarters officials and staff we interviewed in several regional offices said they have seen schools with significant program review findings that had not been identified in annual compliance audits. FSA staff said they have referred some compliance audits to the OIG for quality reviews when they have had questions about the thoroughness of an audit. We also found a couple of examples in our review of school certification documents in which the findings identified in a school’s compliance audit were different from the findings identified by FSA in a program review of the same school covering the same time period. In one case, FSA staff said they probably would have fully recertified the school if they had relied solely on the compliance audit. Instead, they used the program review to determine that the school should be provisionally recertified. Compliance audits and program review findings are based on a sample of student records, and FSA staff said some differences in findings might be explained by differences in the records reviewed. FSA and OIG officials cited several issues that can affect the quality of compliance audits. FSA and OIG officials we interviewed said that some auditors conducting compliance audits have insufficient training in federal student aid, which contributes to audit quality problems. OIG staff also said that even if an auditor meets the general training hour requirements for auditors, the training content may not be relevant for federal student aid audits. In addition, FSA and OIG officials said some schools— particularly smaller schools—tend to hire less experienced auditors in order to save money, often resulting in poor quality audits. FSA officials in most selected regional offices said that additional training on federal student aid for auditors who are new to or unfamiliar with federal student aid could help improve audit quality. FSA and the OIG recently have taken steps to address audit quality and the information available to FSA staff when making certification decisions. These efforts include: Training for auditors: The OIG has taken steps to enhance training offered to auditors of schools’ administration of federal student aid and is exploring opportunities to provide additional training. In December 2017, the OIG and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants cosponsored training for auditors on the OIG’s 2016 revised guide for audits of for-profit schools, and other topics related to auditing federal student aid. The training included discussion of common audit quality issues and areas of highest risk. According to an OIG official, about 200 auditors attended, and after the event, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the OIG posted a recording of the training to their websites to make it available to additional auditors. In addition, OIG officials said they maintain an email account—listed on the OIG website—through which auditors can ask questions and receive responses. In March 2018, the OIG posted frequently asked questions and answers to the website. Timeliness of OIG quality reviews: Both FSA and OIG officials said that the OIG has recently renewed efforts to issue compliance audit quality reviews more quickly, after several years in which staffing shortages and other issues led to some delayed quality reviews. Guidance to schools on selecting an auditor: OIG officials said that at the 2017 FSA training conference for school financial aid staff, they presented to more than 400 participants about factors schools should consider when hiring an auditor. For example, they suggested that schools verify the licenses of certified public accountants, ask about the types of engagements an auditing firm has conducted, request and check references, check for any actions that may have been taken against a firm, and ask whether the auditor has been subject to a previous review by the OIG or another agency. FSA officials said they expected to invite the OIG to present at future FSA conferences, and OIG officials said they were seeking additional opportunities to share information on auditor selection with schools, including a planned presentation to an association of postsecondary schools. FSA working group: FSA recently established a working group to update its guidance to FSA staff on how to coordinate with the OIG to address compliance audits with quality problems. Among other topics, the working group has consulted with the OIG about how schools are made aware of the OIG’s findings regarding the quality of their audits. FSA officials said that OIG officials have provided input and feedback on FSA’s proposed changes to the guidance. Audit guide revisions: In addition, OIG and FSA staff told us they expected the OIG’s 2016 revisions to the for-profit school audit guide to improve the quality of compliance audits for those schools. They said that because the revised guide clarified some issues that were confusing to auditors in the previous guide issued in 2000, auditors might be better able to implement the guidance. The audit guide revisions include more testing and reporting requirements, clarified procedures, and guidance on issues such as fraud reporting and coordinating financial and compliance audits. The 2016 revisions first applied to audits for fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, and FSA began receiving those audits at the end of 2017. In addition, although the OIG’s 2016 revisions only apply to audits of for-profit schools, FSA officials said they planned to establish a working group to consider improvements to audit guidance for public and nonprofit schools. FSA and OIG efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that compliance audits provide accurate and reliable information on school administrative capability for Education’s recertification decisions. We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment. Education’s Office of Inspector General provided technical comments, which we considered and incorporated as appropriate.

Education is responsible for certifying that these schools are eligible for and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools are required to submit an annual compliance audit that provides information on schools' administrative capability, which Education considers in its school certification decisions. GAO was asked to review Education's process for certifying schools to receive federal student aid. This report examines (1) how Education certifies schools to administer federal student aid and how frequently schools are approved and denied certification; and (2) the role of compliance audits in the certification process and what, if any, steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit information. GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials. The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed—for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure). Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification. In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions.

{"input": "", "context": "Including the first woman to serve in 1917, a total of 365 women have been elected or appointed to serve in the U.S. Congress. That first woman was Jeannette Rankin (R-MT), who was elected on November 9, 1916, to the 65 th Congress (1917-March 4, 1919). Table 1 details this service by women in the House, Senate, and both chambers. The 116 th Congress began with 131 women. Table 2 shows that women account for 23.7% of voting Members in the House and Senate (127 of 535); 24.2% of total Members in the House and Senate (131 of 541, including the Delegates and Resident Commissioner); 23.4% of voting Representatives in the House (102 of 435); 24.0% of total Members in the House (106 of 441, including the Delegates and Resident Commissioner); and 25.0% of the Senate. This report includes historical information, including the (1) number and percentage of women in Congress over time; (2) means of entry to Congress; (3) comparisons to international and state legislatures; (4) records for tenure; (5) firsts for women in Congress; (6) African American, Asian Pacific, Hispanic American, and American Indian women in Congress; and (7) women in leadership. It also provides a brief overview of research questions related to the role and impact of women in Congress. For additional biographical information—including the names, committee assignments, dates of service, listings by Congress and state, and (for Representatives) congressional districts of the women who have served in Congress—see CRS Report RL30261, Women in Congress, 1917-2019: Service Dates and Committee Assignments by Member, and Lists by State and Congress , by Jennifer E. Manning and Ida A. Brudnick. Since the 65 th Congress (1917-1918), the number of women serving in Congress generally increased incrementally, and on a few occasions, decreased. In an exception to these incremental changes, the elections in 1992, which came to be known popularly as the \"Year of the Woman,\" represented a jump in the number of women in Congress. As a result of this 1992 election, whereas the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992) concluded with 34 women, on the first day of the 103 rd Congress (1993-1994), the number of women in Congress increased 58.8%, to 54 women. More recently, the 115 th Congress concluded with 115 women, and on the first day of the 116 th Congress, the number of women in Congress increased 13.9%, to 131 women. Figure 1 shows the changes in the number of women serving in each Congress. For a table listing the total number of women who have served in each Congress, including information on turnover within a Congress, please see Table A-2 in the Appendix . Figure 2 shows division of men and women in Congress historically and in the 116 th Congress. As seen in Figure 3 , 49 states (all except Vermont), 4 territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), and the District of Columbia have been represented by a woman in Congress at some time since 1917. Four states (Alaska, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Vermont) have never elected a woman to the House. Eighteen states have never been represented by a female Senator. Fourteen states have been represented by one female Senator, 12 have sent two, and 6 states have sent three. Pursuant to Article I, Section 2, clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution, all Representatives enter office through election, even those who enter after a seat becomes open during a Congress. By contrast, the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified on April 8, 1913, gives state legislatures the option to empower governors to fill Senate vacancies by temporary appointment. The 56 women who have served in the Senate entered initially through three different routes: 34 entered through regularly scheduled elections, 17 were appointed to unexpired terms, and 5 were elected by special election. As Figure 4 shows, approximately 70% (39) of all women who have served in the Senate initially entered Senate service by winning an election (regular or special). Approximately 30% of women Senators entered the Senate initially through an appointment. Of the 17 women who entered by appointment, 10 served less than one year. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, nine years prior to the first appointment of a woman to fill a Senate vacancy, 200 Senators have been appointed. Of these appointees, 91.5% (183) have been men, and 8.5% (17) were women. The current total percentage of voting female representation in Congress (23.7%) is slightly lower than averages of female representation in other countries. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), as of January 1, 2019, women represented 24.3% of national legislative seats (both houses) across the entire world. In the IPU database of worldwide female representation, the United States ties for 78 th worldwide for women in the lower chamber. The Nordic countries (Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Norway) lead the world regionally with 42.3% female representation in national legislatures. The percentage of women in Congress also is lower than the percentage of women holding seats in state legislatures. According to the Center for American Women and Politics, in 2019, \"2,117, or 28.7% of the 7,383 state legislators in the United States are women. Women currently hold 504, or 25.6%, of the 1,972 state senate seats and 1,613, or 29.8%, of the 5,411 state house or assembly seats.\" Across the 50 states, the total seats held by women range from 13.8% in Mississippi to 50.8% in Nevada. Since the beginning of the 92 nd Congress (1971-1972), the first Congress for which comparative state legislature data are available, the total percentage of women in state legislatures has eclipsed the percentage of women in Congress (see Figure 5 ). The greatest disparity between the percentages of female voting representation in state legislatures as compared with Congress occurred in the early 1990s, when women comprised 6.0% of the total Congress in the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992), but 18.3% of state legislatures in 1991. The gap has since narrowed. First woman elected to Congress. Representative Jeannette Rankin (R-MT, 1917-1919, 1941-1943). First woman to serve in the Senate. Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-GA) was appointed in 1922 to fill the unexpired term of a Senator who had died in office. In addition to being the first female Senator, Mrs. Felton holds two other Senate records. Her tenure in the Senate remains the shortest ever (one day), and, at the age of 87, she is the oldest person ever to begin Senate service. First woman to succeed her spouse in the Senate and also the first female initially elected to a full six-year term. Hattie Caraway (D-AR, 1931-1945) was first appointed in 1931 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, Thaddeus H. Caraway (D-AR, House, 1913-1921; Senate, 1921-1931), and then was subsequently elected to two six-year terms. First woman elected to the Senate without having first been appointed to serve in that body and first woman to serve in both houses of Congress . Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) was elected to the Senate and served from January 3, 1949, until January 3, 1973. She had previously served in the House (June 3, 1940, to January 3, 1949). First woman elected to the Senate without first having been elected to the House or having been elected or appointed to fill an unexpired Senate term. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS, 1979-1997). First woman elected Speaker of the House. As Speaker of the House in the 110 th and 111 th Congresses (2007-2010), Nancy Pelosi held the highest position of leadership ever by a woman in the U.S. government. She was elected Speaker again at the beginning of the 116 th Congress. Longest total length of service by a woman in Congress. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), who served from January 3, 1977, to January 3, 2017, holds this record (40 years, 10 of which were spent in the House). On March 17, 2012, Senator Mikulski surpassed the record previously held by Edith Nourse Rogers (R-MA). Longest length of service by a woman in the House. On March 18, 2018, currently serving Representative Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) surpassed the record previously held by Representative Rogers. Representative Kaptur has been serving in the House since January 3, 1983 (36 years). Representative Rogers served in the House for 35 years, from June 25, 1925, until her death on September 10, 1960. Longest length of service by a woman in the Senate. Senator Mikulski also holds the record for length of Senate service by a woman (30 years). In January 2011, she broke the service record previously held by Senator Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME), who served 24 years in the Senate and 8.6 years in the House. Sixteen women have served in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) was the first such woman, as well as the first woman elected to the Senate without first having been elected or appointed to fill a vacant Senate seat. She was first elected to the House to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband (Clyde Smith, R-ME, 1937-1940), and she served from June 10, 1940, until January 3, 1949, when she began her Senate service. She served in the Senate until January 3, 1973. Twenty-five African American women serve in the 116 th Congress, including 2 Delegates, a record number. The previous record number was 21, including 2 Delegates, serving at the end of the 115 th Congress. A total of 47 African American women have served in Congress. The first was Representative Shirley Chisholm (D-NY, 1969-1983). Senator Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL, 1993-1999) was the first African American woman to have served in the Senate. The African American women Members of the 116 th Congress are listed in Table 3 . Ten Asian Pacific American women serve in the 116 th Congress. Patsy Mink (D-HI), who served in the House from 1965-1977 and again from 1990-2002, was the first of 13 Asian Pacific American women to serve in Congress. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) is the first Asian Pacific American woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Twenty Hispanic or Latino women have served in Congress, all but one in the House, and 15 of them, a record number, serve in the 116 th Congress. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL, 1989-2018) is the first Hispanic woman to serve in Congress, and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV, 2017-present) is the first Hispanic woman Senator. Representatives Sharice Davids (D-KS) and Deb Haaland (D-NM), both first elected to the 116 th Congress, are the first female enrolled members of federally recognized tribes to serve in Congress. A number of women in Congress, listed in Table 6 , have held positions in their party's leadership. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) holds the highest position of leadership in the U.S. government ever held by a woman. As Speaker of the House in the 116 th Congress, she is second in the line of succession for the presidency. She also served as Speaker in the 110 th and 111 th Congresses. In the 108 th , 109 th , and 112 th -115 th Congresses, she was elected the House Democratic leader. Previously, Representative Pelosi was elected House Democratic whip, in the 107 th Congress, on October 10, 2001, effective January 15, 2002. She was also the first woman nominated to be Speaker of the House. Senator Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME), chair of the Senate Republican Conference from 1967 to 1972, holds the Senate record for the highest, as well as first, leadership position held by a female Senator. The first woman Member to be elected to any party leadership position was Chase Going Woodhouse (D-CT), who served as House Democratic Caucus Secretary in the 81 st Congress (1949-1950). As chair of the House Expenditures in the Post Office Department Committee (67 th -68 th Congresses), Mae Ella Nolan was the first woman to chair any congressional committee. As chair of the Senate Enrolled Bills Committee (73 rd -78 th Congresses), Hattie Caraway was the first woman to chair a Senate committee. In total, 26 women have chaired a House committee (including select committees); 14 women have chaired a Senate committee (including select committees); 1 female Senator has chaired two joint committees (related to her service on a standing committee); and 2 female Representatives have chaired a joint committee. In the 116 th Congress, there are currently nine committees led by women: five standing committees in the House, one standing committee in the Senate, one select committee in the House, one select committee in the Senate, and one joint committee. As the number of women in Congress has increased in recent decades, and following the large increase in women following the 1992 elections in particular, numerous studies of Congress have examined the role and impact of these women. Central to these studies have been questions about the following: The legislative behavior of women in Congress, including whether the legislative behavior of female Members differs from their male counterparts. For example, what has the increase in women in Congress meant for descriptive representation (i.e., when representatives and those represented share demographic characteristics, such as representation of women by women) and substantive representation (i.e., representation of policy preferences and a linkage to policy outcomes)? This also includes examinations of whether women Members sponsor more \"women's issues bills\" or speak more frequently on the House floor about women. These examinations also include questions regarding whether there are any differences in roll call voting behavior between men and women Members of Congress, with a focus on successive Members in the same district, in the same party, or in the chamber overall. The \"effectiveness\" of female legislators, particularly in comparison to male legislators. These studies have examined bill sponsorship and cosponsorship; women's success in shepherding sponsored bills or amendments into law; committee work; success in securing federal funds; consensus building activities and efforts to form coalitions; effectiveness while in the majority and minority; and their impact on the institution overall. The path that leads women to run for office, comparative success rates of female compared with male candidates, and career trajectory once in Congress. This includes professional backgrounds and experience, barriers to entry, and fundraising; the so-called widow effect, in which many women first secured entry to Congress following the death of a spouse; and reelection efforts and influences on decisions regarding voluntary retirement or pursuing other office.", "answers": ["A record 131 women currently serve in the 116th Congress.

{"input": "", "context": "T he farm bill is an omnibus, multiyear law that governs an array of agricultural and food programs. It provides an opportunity for Congress to choose how much support to provide for agriculture and nutrition and how to allocate it among competing constituencies. The farm bill has typically undergone reauthorization about every five years. The current farm bill—the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-334 , H.R. 2 ), often called the \"2018 farm bill\"—was enacted in December 2018 and expires in 2023. From its beginning in the 1930s, farm bills have focused primarily on farm commodity programs to support a handful of staple commodities—corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, dairy, and sugar. In recent decades, farm bills have expanded in scope to include a Nutrition title since 1973 and since then Conservation, Horticulture, Bioenergy, Credit, Research, and Rural Development titles. Budget matters increasingly influence the development of the farm bill. While other reports discuss policy issues, this report focuses on the budgetary effects across the whole farm bill. One way to compare the activities covered by a farm bill is by the allocation of federal spending and, more specifically, by how much is spent in total and how a new law changes allocations or policy. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates are the official measures when bills are considered and are grounded in long-standing budget laws and rules. Recent farm bills have faced various budget situations, including spending more under a budget surplus, cutting spending for deficit reduction, and remaining budget neutral. For example The 2002 farm bill (the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, P.L. 107-171 ) was enacted under a budget surplus that allowed it to make changes that were projected to increase spending by $73 billion, or 22%, over a 10-year budget window—more than half of which was for the farm commodity programs. The 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246 ) was officially budget neutral, though it included $10 billion of offsets over 10 years from tax-related and other provisions that allowed it to increase spending on the Nutrition, Conservation, and Disaster titles. The 2014 farm bill (the Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79 ) was enacted under deficit reduction and budget sequestration that influenced its legislative development. It made changes that projected a net reduction of $17 billion, or 1.7%, over 10 years ($23 billion including sequestration). The 2018 farm bill (the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334 ) was held to a budget-neutral position over its 10-year budget window. Some budget amounts were reallocated across programs within issue areas and across titles of the farm bill, as discussed throughout this report. Generally, farm bills authorize spending in two categories: mandatory and discretionary. From a budgetary perspective, many of the larger programs are assumed to continue beyond the end of a farm bill, even though their authorizations to operate may expire. That projection for mandatory programs, as explained below, provides funding to reauthorize programs, reallocate funding to other programs, or take offsets for deficit reduction. For other programs, funding must come by other means. This includes new programs, those without baseline, or discretionary programs. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and crop insurance have their own mandatory spending sources, but most other mandatory outlays are paid through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Discretionary spending is authorized throughout the farm bill, including most rural development, credit, and research programs, among others. Some smaller research, bioenergy, and rural development programs are authorized to receive both mandatory and discretionary funding. Most agency operations (salaries and expenses) are financed with discretionary funds. Discretionary appropriations are made separately through an annual agriculture appropriations act. While both types of programs are significant, mandatory programs often dominate the farm bill debate. Therefore, the majority of this report focuses on mandatory spending Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the $428 billion five-year total of projected mandatory outlays at enactment for the life of the 2018 farm bill (FY2019-FY2023). Figure 2 shows program-level detail for agriculture-specific programs, particularly the Farm Commodity and Conservation titles. Table 1 presents these outlays (the fifth and 10 th columns), and how budgetary resources were reallocated across titles of the farm bill, for both the five- and 10-year budget windows. The terms baseline and score are explained in later sections of this report. Mandatory spending is authorized throughout the farm bill, but four titles presently account for about 99% of the mandatory farm bill spending: Commodities (7.3%), Nutrition (76%), Crop Insurance (8.9%), and Conservation (6.8%). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline is a projection at a particular point in time of future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law. The baseline is the benchmark against which proposed changes in law are measured. The CBO develops the budget baseline under various laws and follows the supervision of the House and Senate Budget Committees. When a new bill is proposed that would affect mandatory spending, the score (cost impact) is measured in relation to the baseline. Changes that increase spending relative to the baseline have a positive score; those that decrease spending relative to the baseline have a negative score. Having a baseline essentially gives programs built-in future funding if policymakers decide that the programs should continue—that is, straightforward reauthorization would not have a scoring effect (budget neutral). Once a new law is passed, the projected outlays at enactment equal the baseline plus the score . This sum becomes the budget foundation of the new law. CBO periodically projects future government spending via its budget baselines, and evaluates proposed bills via scoring estimates. The baseline incorporates domestic and international economic conditions at the time the baseline is projected. Generally, a program with estimated mandatory spending in the last year of its authorization may be assumed to continue in the baseline as if there were no change in policy and it did not expire. This is the situation for most of the major, long-standing farm bill provisions such as the farm commodity programs or supplemental nutrition assistance. However, some programs do not continue in the baseline beyond the end of a farm bill because they are either programs with estimated mandatory spending less than a minimum $50 million scoring threshold in the last year of the farm bill, or new programs established after 1997 for which the Budget Committees have determined that mandatory spending shall not extend beyond expiration. This decision may have been made in consultation with the Agriculture Committees for a number of reasons, such as to reduce the program's 10-year cost when a farm bill is written or to prevent the program from having a continuing baseline. The 2014 farm bill had 39 programs without baseline beyond FY2018 that received $2.824 billion in mandatory funding over five years. The CBO baseline that was used to develop the 2018 farm bill was released in April 2018 (the first and sixth data columns in Table 1 ). It projected that if the 2014 farm bill were extended, as amended as of April 2018, farm bill programs would cost $426 billion over the next five years (FY2019-FY2023) and $867 billion over the next 10 years (FY2019-2028). Most of the 10-year amount, 77%, was in the Nutrition title for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The remaining 23%, $203 billion baseline, was for agricultural programs, mostly in crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. Other titles of the farm bill contributed about 1% of the baseline, some of which are funded primarily with discretionary spending. Table 2 presents the April 2018 baseline by farm bill title with some program-level details for select titles. The CBO score measures the budgetary impact of changes made by the 2018 farm bill. It is measured relative to its benchmark—the CBO baseline. Budget enforcement procedures follow an array of federal budget rules, such as \"PayGo,\" which required budgetary offsets to balance new spending to avoid increasing the federal deficit. Although the farm bill is a five-year authorization—the 2018 farm bill covers FY2019-FY2023—budget rules required it to be scored over a 10-year budget window. Thus, when the farm bill is discussed during legislative development, it may be more often presented by its effect over the 10-year budget window than the five-year duration of the law. Separately, statements about the total cost of the farm bill may be in terms of its five-year outlays (i.e., projected spending over the five-year life of the farm bill). Both can be accurate measures of the farm bill budget depending on the context. CBO released several interim scores of the 2018 farm bill during the various stages of its development. These include scores of the effects of the House-introduced bill ( H.R. 2 ), House-reported bill ( H.R. 2 ), Senate-reported bill ( S. 3042 ), House-passed bill ( H.R. 2 ) and the Senate-passed Amendment to H.R. 2 (the second, third, seventh and eighth columns in Table 1 ; see also the more detailed section-level scores in Appendix A ), Conference agreement for H.R. 2 (the fourth and ninth columns in Table 1 ; see also the more detailed section-level scores in Table 3 ). Subsequent to the House-passed score, CBO released a more detailed assessment of the farm commodity program payment limit provisions in the House-passed bill. This score did not change the amounts but explained background for the score of those provisions in greater detail. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the title-level changes (scores) in the 2018 farm bill conference agreement and the House- and Senate-passed bills that preceded it. Relative to the baseline, the overall score of the 2018 farm bill is budget neutral over a 10-year period. The House-passed bill would have decreased 10-year outlays by $1.8 billion, and the Senate-passed bill was budget neutral. The overall relatively small or budget-neutral net scores are the result of sometimes relatively larger increases and reductions across titles. Generally, the enacted farm bill follows the scoring approach of the Senate bill more closely than the House bill. In the new law, as in the Senate-passed bill, most of the reductions are from the Rural Development title. Six titles in the law have increased outlays over the 10-year period, including Commodities, Trade, Research, Energy, Horticulture, and Miscellaneous. The House-passed bill would have made 10-year reductions in outlays in the Conservation, Nutrition, Energy, and Crop Insurance titles that the conference agreement did not adopt. When separated into the five- and 10-year budget windows, each version of the 2018 farm bill shows a similar pattern of changes in projected outlays. Figure 4 show the scores for the first five years, the second five years, and the 10-year total for the enacted conference agreement. The enacted farm bill increases net outlays in the first five years by $1.8 billion, which is offset by the same amount of net reductions in outlays during the second five years. Therefore, the 10-year net score is budget neutral. In the enacted law, the Conservation and Nutrition titles—which have increases in outlays over the first five years—have decreases during the second five years. Both titles are budget-neutral over the 10-year period. This may occur because of the time needed to implement changes or to make provisions more appealing in the early years despite having less baseline for a future farm bill. A similar pattern held for the House-passed bill ( Figure 5 ) and the Senate-passed bill ( Figure 6 ). In both of those versions, the Conservation and Nutrition titles had increases in the first five years followed by decreases in the second five years. The House-passed bill had reductions in the Nutrition title that were not retained in the conference agreement. The Senate-passed bill would have reduced baseline for the Commodities title, whereas the conference agreement is projected to increase it. Some of the net scores for single titles presented above are the net result of increases and decreases by provisions within the same title. Sometimes, these increases or decreases are relatively large compared to the net title-level effect. These budget effects may reflect policy proposals that may not be apparent in the net title-level scores that are shown in the previous figures. For example In the enacted law, the Conservation title has one section with a $12.4 billion reduction over 10 years (reducing the Conservation Stewardship Program) and seven sections that add to $12.4 billion in increased spending ( Figure 7 ). In the House-passed bill, the Nutrition title had six sections that summed to a $22.0 billion reduction over 10 years (including those for work requirements) and 18 sections that added to $20.6 billion in increased spending. Similarly, the Conservation title had two sections that summed to a $12.6 billion reduction and eight sections that added to $11.8 billion in increased spending ( Figure 8 ). In the Senate-passed bill, none of the titles' section-by-section scores were as large as for the Nutrition and Conservation titles in the House bill. Nonetheless, the section-by-section scores of the Senate-passed bill showed both increases and decreases in the Conservation, Nutrition, Commodities and Miscellaneous titles ( Figure 9 ). For 23 of the 39 of the \"programs without baseline\" from the 2014 farm bill, the 2018 farm bill provides continuing funding and, in some cases, permanent baseline for future farm bills (see the footnotes in Table 3 ). Fourteen of the programs without baseline received mandatory funding during FY2019-FY2023 but no baseline beyond the end of the farm bill. Nine of the programs without baseline received mandatory funding and permanent baseline beyond the end of the farm bill. Three of these programs were combined with six others into six provisions in the 2018 farm bill. In addition, five provisions in the 2018 farm bill created new programs without baseline for the next farm bill. When a new law is passed, the projected cost at enactment equals the baseline plus the score . This sum becomes the foundation of the new law and may be compared to future CBO baselines as an indicator of how actual costs develop as the law is implemented and conditions change. Table 4 shows the result of this calculation by updating the farm bill baseline ( Table 2 ) by adding the score for programs that were changed by the farm bill ( Table 3 ). The $428 billion projected five-year total for the life of the 2018 farm bill (FY2019-FY2023) is illustrated in Figure 1 . Agriculture program-level detail is illustrated in Figure 2 . Table 1 summarizes these amounts by title for the five- and 10-year budget windows (the fifth and 10 th columns). SNAP accounts for 76% of the $428 billion five-year total. The remaining 24%, $102 billion of projected outlays, is for agricultural programs, mostly in crop insurance (8.9%), farm commodity programs (7.3%), and conservation (6.8%). Relative to historical farm bill spending, Figure 10 shows mandatory outlays for the four largest titles—Nutrition, Crop Insurance, Farm Commodity Programs, and Conservation—that account for 99% of projected spending in the 2018 farm bill. The figure shows the following trends: SNAP outlays, which compose most of the Nutrition title, increased markedly after the recession in 2009 and have been gradually decreasing since 2012. Crop insurance outlays increased steadily over the period, especially as higher market prices and program participation over the past decade have raised the value of insurable commodities. Farm commodity programs outlays generally rise and fall inversely with commodity markets. They were high after losses in the early 2000s, generally trended lower under the direct payment program, and tended to increase after a return to counter-cyclical programs in the 2014 farm bill. Conservation program outlays have grown steadily but have leveled off in recent years. Appendix A. Scores of House-Passed and Senate-Passed Versions of H.R. 2 Appendix B. Discretionary Authorizations In addition to providing mandatory spending, various sections of the farm bill authorize appropriations that may be provided in future discretionary appropriations acts. Such \"authorizations for appropriation\" are not actual funding but are essentially an indication from the authorizing committees to the appropriations committees about funding intentions. They are subject to budget enforcement via future appropriations bills. Although the score of the farm bill is primarily about mandatory spending, some CBO scoring documents include an estimate of the discretionary spending that would be needed to implement provisions that have authorizations of appropriations. The CBO score of the conference agreement did not address discretionary authorizations. However, earlier CBO scores of the House- and Senate-passed bills did summarize the authorizations for appropriation. Overall, the similarity between the scores of these bills may be an indicator of the authorization levels in the enacted farm bill. For the House-passed version of the farm bill, CBO estimated that implementing the provisions of H.R. 2 that specified authorizations of appropriations would cost $24.5 billion over the five-year period FY2019-FY2023, assuming appropriation of the specified amounts. For the Senate-passed version, the amount was slightly smaller at $23.7 billion. These projections were for the whole bill and not by title. However, the earlier committee-reported scores did estimate the authorizations by title, as shown in Table B-1 . Because the totals of the chamber-passed versions remain nearly the same as the committee-reported totals, the earlier title-level estimates may be indicative of the conference agreement. Three titles account for about 85% of the discretionary authorizations for appropriation in the House and Senate committee-reported farm bill scores: Trade, Research, and Rural Development ( Table B-1 ). Actual funding in annual Agriculture appropriations acts does not necessarily correlate to the authorization for appropriation in the farm bill. The annual authorization for appropriation provided in the 2018 farm bill is between $2 billion and $6 billion ( Table B-1 ), which for this comparison is broadly similar to nearly $7 billion in authorizations for appropriation that were in the 2014 farm bill. However, actual discretionary funding in recent Agricultural appropriations acts total in excess of $20 billion. The difference is because not all of the actual appropriations have their authorization in each farm bill. For example, the Agriculture appropriations act includes funding for salaries and expenses of USDA agencies that may be permanently authorized or is not necessarily reauthorized in the farm bill. Also, jurisdiction for appropriations acts may include agencies or programs that are not in the jurisdiction of the farm bill authorizing committees (such as the roughly $6 billion appropriation for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children that is not in House Agriculture Committee jurisdiction).", "answers": ["The farm bill is an omnibus, multiyear law that governs an array of agricultural and food programs. The farm bill has typically undergone reauthorization about every five years. The current farm bill—the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334), often called the \"2018 farm bill\"—was enacted in December 2018 and expires in 2023. The farm bill provides an opportunity for Congress to choose how much support, if any, to provide for various agriculture and nutrition programs and how to allocate it among competing constituencies. Under congressional budgeting rules, many programs are assumed to continue beyond the end of a farm bill. From a budgetary perspective, this provides a baseline for comparing future spending reauthorizations, reallocations to other programs, and reductions to projected spending. Since 2000, congressional goals for the farm bill's budget have varied: The 2002 farm bill increased spending over 10 years, the 2008 farm bill was essentially budget neutral, the 2014 farm bill reduced spending, and the 2018 farm bill is budget neutral, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The farm bill authorizes programs in two spending categories: mandatory spending and discretionary spending. Mandatory spending is not only authorized but also actually provided via budget enforcement rules. Discretionary spending may be authorized in a farm bill but is not actually provided until budget decisions are made in a future annual appropriations act. The CBO baseline is a projection at a particular point in time of future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law. When a new bill is proposed that would affect mandatory spending, the cost impact (score) is measured in relation to the baseline. Changes that increase spending relative to the baseline have a positive score; those that decrease spending relative to the baseline have a negative score. Federal budget rules such as \"PayGo\" may require budgetary offsets to balance new spending so that there is no increase in the federal deficit. The April 2018 CBO baseline was the official benchmark to measure changes made by the 2018 farm bill. The five-year baseline was $426 billion over FY2019-FY2023 (what the 2014 farm bill would have spent had it been continued). The budgetary impact of the 2018 farm bill is measured relative to that baseline. Among its impacts are these four points: 1. The enacted farm bill increases net outlays in the first five years by $1.8 billion, which is offset by the same amount of net reductions in outlays during the second five years. Therefore, over 10 years, the net impact is budget neutral. 2. Eight titles in the enacted law have increased outlays over the five-year period, including Farm Commodities, Conservation, Trade, Nutrition, Research, Energy, Horticulture, and Miscellaneous. Two of those titles—Conservation and Nutrition—have reductions in the second five years of the budget window that make them budget neutral over 10 years. 3. Most of the budget reductions at the title level that provide offsets for the increases above, especially in the 10-year budget window, are from changes in the rural development title. 4. The 2018 farm bill provides continuing funding and, in some cases, permanent baseline, for 23 of the 39 so-called programs without baseline from the 2014 farm bill. Projected outlays for the 2018 farm bill at enactment are $428 billion over the FY2019-FY2023 five-year life of the act. The Nutrition title and its largest program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), account for $326 billion (76%) of those projected outlays. The remaining 24%, $102 billion, is for agricultural programs, mostly in crop insurance (8.9%), farm commodity programs (7.3%), and conservation (6.8%). Other titles of the farm bill account for 1% of the mandatory spending, some of which are funded primarily with discretionary spending. Historical trends in farm bill spending show increased SNAP outlays after the 2009 recession, increased crop insurance outlays based on insurable coverage, farm commodity programs outlays that vary inversely with markets, and steadily increasing conservation program outlays that have leveled off in recent years."], "length": 3736, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9f9ae0a4dfba72ce9072abea1ca9c7d9df1d71be3da490c0"}
{"input": "", "context": "As Interior’s primary water management agency, Reclamation’s mission has been to manage, develop, and protect water and water-related resources in 17 western states since 1902. Reclamation has led or provided assistance in the construction of most of the large dams and water diversion structures in the West for the purpose of developing water supplies for irrigation, municipal water use, flood control, and habitat enhancement, among others. Reclamation is organized into five regions—Great Plains, Lower Colorado, Mid-Pacific, Pacific Northwest, and Upper Colorado—and the agency’s central office in Denver provides technical and policy support. Each regional office oversees the water projects, including Title XVI projects and studies, located within its regional boundaries. The types of projects eligible under the Title XVI program include, among others, construction of water treatment facilities, pipelines to distribute reused water, and tanks and reservoirs to store reused water. The Title XVI program is one of several programs under Interior’s WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage America’s Resources for Tomorrow) Program. The WaterSMART program is implemented by Reclamation and the U.S. Geological Survey within Interior. According to an Interior document, the WaterSMART program focuses on identifying strategies to help ensure sufficient supplies of clean water for drinking, economic activities, recreation, and ecosystem health. Reclamation carries out its portion of the WaterSMART program by administering grants, including Title XVI grants for water reuse, conducting research, and providing technical assistance and scientific expertise. Reclamation offers three types of grants to project sponsors under the Title XVI program: construction projects, which are projects to plan, design, or construct infrastructure for the treatment and distribution of reused water; feasibility studies, which are documents that generally identify specific water reuse opportunities, describe alternatives, and incorporate other considerations, such as the financial capability of the project sponsor; and research studies, which are studies to help states, tribes, and local communities establish or expand water reuse markets, improve existing water reuse facilities, or streamline the implementation of new water reuse facilities. Key Terms Related to Water Reuse Acre-foot of water: about 326,000 gallons generally identify specific water reuse opportunities; describe alternatives; and incorporate other considerations, such as the financial capability of the project sponsor. Federal awards for construction projects under the Title XVI program are generally limited to 25 percent of total project costs—up to $20 million in federal funding—and require a 75 percent nonfederal cost share from the project sponsor. Federal funding for feasibility studies under the Title XVI program is generally limited to 50 percent of the total study costs, up to $450,000, and federal funding for research studies is generally limited to 25 percent of the total study costs, up to $300,000. Reclamation generally awards Title XVI grants for construction projects to project sponsors in installments over multiple years before the federal funding maximum for each project is reached, whereas it generally awards the full amount for feasibility and research study grants in a single year. Potable: water that is suitable for drinking. Project sponsors: water districts, wastewater or sanitation districts, municipalities, tribes, and other entities that develop projects or studies eligible for Title XVI grants. tribes, and local communities establish or expand water reuse markets, improve existing water reuse facilities, or streamline the implementation of new water reuse facilities. From fiscal year 1992, when the Title XVI program was established, through fiscal year 2009, Congress authorized 53 Title XVI projects. Each of these projects was subject to a cap on the federal cost share. In fiscal years 1992 through 2010, Congress generally directed funding for these specific authorized projects each year. Starting in fiscal year 2011, Congress began appropriating funding for the Title XVI program without directing specific funding to individual projects. As a result, Reclamation started using a competitive process to award Title XVI grants to projects and studies, through which project sponsors with authorized projects applied for Title XVI grants. Only the 53 projects that were already authorized by Congress were eligible to apply for grants for construction projects. Section 4009(c) of the WIIN Act, enacted in December 2016, authorized an additional $50 million to be appropriated for water reuse projects. To be eligible to receive Title XVI grants under the WIIN Act, projects must submit a completed feasibility study to Reclamation, and Reclamation must review the study to determine whether, among other things, the project is technically and financially feasible and provides a federal benefit in accordance with the reclamation laws. Reclamation is then to submit a report with the results of its review to Congress, and projects determined to be feasible are then eligible to apply for grants under the competitive grant program established by the WIIN Act. Each feasibility study identifies an estimated project cost. Like most projects individually authorized prior to the WIIN Act, the federal share of this cost is generally capped at 25 percent, up to $20 million. In addition to construction projects, Reclamation began awarding Title XVI grants to project sponsors for feasibility studies in fiscal year 2011 and for research studies in fiscal year 2016. Figure 1 shows a timeline of the Title XVI program. With water reuse, water that is typically unusable, such as municipal or industrial wastewater, undergoes additional treatment to make it suitable for certain purposes. For example, municipal wastewater typically undergoes primary and secondary treatment before it can be discharged into a river, stream, or other body of water. With water reuse, wastewater generally undergoes further (tertiary) treatment to remove additional nutrients and suspended solids and to disinfect the water. The treated water can then be reused for nonpotable uses, such as landscape or agricultural irrigation or industrial uses. In some cases, wastewater undergoes additional, advanced treatment—such as microfiltration and reverse osmosis—and may then be suitable for potable uses, such as injection into a groundwater basin or reservoir where it may later be extracted for drinking water. Figure 2 shows some of the typical treatment processes that may be applied to reused water, and figure 3 shows some of the typical uses of reused water. Several reports have shown that water reuse could offer significant untapped water supplies, particularly in coastal areas facing water shortages. For example, in a 2012 report on municipal wastewater reuse, the National Research Council of the National Academies estimated that U.S. municipalities discharged about 12 billion gallons of treated municipal wastewater each day into coastal waters. They estimated that reuse of these coastal discharges could directly augment available water sources by providing the equivalent of 27 percent of the municipal supply. Municipalities discharge another 20 billion gallons each day to inland locations. While reuse of inland discharges has the potential to affect the water supply of downstream users by decreasing the amount of water available to them, we previously found that at least some of this volume could also be beneficial. Even with such potential uses, the Environmental Protection Agency reported in 2012 that only 7 to 8 percent of municipal wastewater was being intentionally reused in the United States. In our past work, we have highlighted the importance of awarding competitive grants in a fair and transparent way and monitoring grants. In recent years, OMB has taken actions to help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of grantmaking across the federal government. In particular, in December 2014, OMB’s Uniform Guidance became effective for new grant awards after adoption by federal grantmaking agencies, including Interior. The Uniform Guidance requires, among other things, that federal agencies provide public notices of funding opportunities, and these notices are to contain information, such as key dates and the merit and other criteria that the agency will use to evaluate applications. The Uniform Guidance also requires certain monitoring activities for federal grants, such as generally requiring grant recipients to submit financial reports. From fiscal years 1992 through 2017, Reclamation awarded about $715 million for 46 construction projects and 71 studies under the Title XVI program, based on our review of agency documents. Most of this funding—about $703 million—went toward construction projects, while the remaining awards were for feasibility and research studies. Some construction projects remain eligible for Title XVI grants. Specifically, about $464 million in grant funding not yet awarded up to the federal ceiling remains for individually congressionally authorized Title XVI construction projects, and about $513 million remains in total estimated projects eligible for Title XVI grants under the WIIN Act, as of August 2018. Across the three different types of grants offered under the Title XVI program—construction projects, feasibility studies, and research studies—Reclamation awarded about $715 million from fiscal years 1992 through 2017, according to agency documents. This $715 million awarded under Title XVI leveraged more than $2.8 billion in nonfederal cost share. Reclamation awarded most of this Title XVI funding for construction projects, as shown in table 1. Overall, Reclamation awarded about $703 million under Title XVI to 46 construction projects from fiscal years 1992 through 2017. Of these 46 construction projects that received awards, 43 were individually congressionally authorized construction projects and 3 were construction projects that were eligible for Title XVI grants under the WIIN Act, according to agency documents we reviewed. Additionally, Reclamation made awards for 71 studies—58 feasibility study grants since fiscal year 2011 and 13 research study grants since fiscal year 2016. Based on our review of Reclamation financial data, some construction projects remain eligible for Title XVI grants. Eligible project costs fell into two categories: (1) grant funding not yet awarded up to the federal ceiling for individually congressionally authorized Title XVI construction projects, and (2) the federal share of estimated costs identified in feasibility studies for projects eligible for Title XVI grants under the WIIN Act. About $464 million in not-yet-awarded funding remained for 28 individually congressionally authorized Title XVI construction projects as of August 2018. Also, about $513 million remained in estimated project costs for the 40 construction projects that were eligible under the WIIN Act, as of August 2018, as shown in table 2 below. As of August 2018, of the 53 individually congressionally authorized construction projects, more than half—28 projects—had remaining project costs eligible for Title XVI grants. The 13 ongoing congressionally authorized projects had about $233 million in project costs that had not yet been awarded. Some project sponsors told us that they were in the process of designing or constructing projects. Others told us that while they were not currently designing or constructing projects, they had plans to pursue additional Title XVI grant awards in the future. More than one-third of the $233 million in remaining eligible project costs was for two projects— located in San Diego and San Jose, California—that were two of the projects authorized when the Title XVI program was created in 1992. The 15 congressionally authorized projects with no planned construction had remaining project costs of about $231 million eligible for Title XVI grants. Project sponsors identified several reasons why they were not planning to apply for further grant awards. Specifically, several project sponsors said they had faced challenges in applying for further grants because language in the statutes authorizing the projects limited the scope of their projects. For example, one project sponsor told us that it was interested in expanding its water reuse demonstration facility but that it was not eligible to apply for additional Title XVI grants because the statute that authorized the project specifically authorized a demonstration facility. In addition, one project sponsor stated that its project authorization had already reached its sunset date, which means the project can no longer apply for Title XVI grants. Some of the project sponsors with no construction planned said that they may consider applying for additional Title XVI grants under their existing authorizations in the future, should they decide to move forward with construction. However, others said that they had decided not to move forward with authorized projects and had no plans to apply for Title XVI grants in the future. For example, one project sponsor said that it had determined that its project was no longer financially feasible. In addition, as of August 2018, 40 projects had Reclamation-approved feasibility studies that had been transmitted to Congress, based on our review of agency documents, and were therefore eligible to apply for Title XVI construction grants under the WIIN Act. A total of about $513 million in project costs across these 40 projects remained eligible for Title XVI grants. Of the 40 projects, 20 applied for Title XVI grants in fiscal year 2017, and Reclamation selected 3 for awards. These 20 projects had about $269 million in project costs that remained eligible for Title XVI grants. Twenty projects did not apply for Title XVI grants in fiscal year 2017 and had about $244 million in project costs that remained eligible for these grants, as of August 2018. Title XVI projects and studies for fiscal years 1992 through 2017 cover various uses for reused water and include both urban and rural areas throughout the West, based on our review of agency data as well as documents from and interviews with project sponsors. For example, Title XVI construction projects produce both nonpotable and potable reused water for a variety of purposes, such as landscape and agricultural irrigation, habitat restoration, and extraction as drinking water. The projects and studies funded by the Title XVI program include both urban and rural areas throughout the West, with California accounting for 36 construction projects and about 90 percent of total Title XVI funding. Title XVI construction projects are generally large-scale infrastructure projects, such as water reuse treatment plants and pipelines, that produce, store, and distribute reused water for a variety of purposes, both nonpotable and potable. Since the inception of the Title XVI program, Reclamation has awarded Title XVI grants to construction projects that cumulatively provided nearly 390,000 acre-feet of reused water in 2017. According to Reclamation data, the projects funded by Title XVI individually delivered between 38 acre-feet of reused water and more than 100,000 acre-feet of water in fiscal year 2017. Most of these construction projects provided reused water for nonpotable uses across four main categories: (1) landscape irrigation, (2) agricultural irrigation, (3) commercial and industrial use, and (4) habitat restoration. Landscape irrigation. Landscape irrigation—including irrigation of golf courses, road medians, school grounds, parks, sport fields, and other green spaces—is the most common use of reused water produced by Title XVI projects, with 29 Title XVI projects producing reused water for this purpose, based on our analysis of documents from Reclamation and project sponsors. The reused, nonpotable water produced by such projects is generally distributed through purple-colored pipes, to denote that the water is not for drinking purposes. For example, the Title XVI program provided grants to Eastern Municipal Water District—a water district located in Southern California—to help build water reuse infrastructure, including pipelines, pumping stations, and storage tanks. With this added storage capacity, the district has the ability to store more than 2 billion gallons of reused water, which is used to irrigate sports fields, golf courses, parks, school grounds, and medians, according to the project sponsor. By maximizing use of its reused water, the project sponsor noted that the district is reducing its dependence on water piped in from other parts of the state or region. Similarly, the Title XVI program provided grants to help build pipelines and reservoirs to distribute and store reused water for landscape irrigation and other purposes in other parts of California (see fig. 4). Agricultural irrigation. Reused water produced by Title XVI projects is also used to irrigate a variety of agricultural products, including fruits and vegetables, flowers, and vineyards. For example, the North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program is helping to provide a reliable water source for the Del Puerto Water District, which provides water to approximately 45,000 acres of farmland in California’s San Joaquin Valley, according to the project sponsor. The Del Puerto Water District has encountered water shortages in recent years, which have created economic hardships on growers in the area, according to the project sponsor. Title XVI grants provided under WIIN Act authority helped the district expand its reused water supply and distribution infrastructure and ensure a reliable, drought-resistant water supply, according to the project sponsor. In addition, reused water produced by the Watsonville Area Water Recycling Project near Watsonville, California, is used to irrigate strawberries and other fruits and vegetables as well as flowers. The groundwater basin that serves the coastal region where Watsonville is located has been overdrafted for a long time, causing groundwater elevations to drop below sea level and leading to seawater intrusion that makes the groundwater unusable in certain areas, according to the project sponsor. This sponsor noted that Watsonville’s Title XVI project helps reduce demand on the overdrafted groundwater basin, which in turn helps to protect against further seawater intrusion and also provides a reliable, drought-tolerant water supply to help protect the region’s agricultural economy. Figure 5 shows flowers in a greenhouse that are irrigated with reused water from Watsonville’s Title XVI project. Commercial and industrial use. Reused water produced by Title XVI projects is used for cooling towers at power plants and data centers, oil production, toilet flushing in university and commercial buildings, and for other commercial and industrial purposes, according to project sponsors. For example, some of the reused water produced by the Southern Nevada Title XVI project is used for power plant cooling, and reused water from San Jose’s Title XVI project is used for cooling at data centers in California’s Silicon Valley. In addition, reused water from the Long Beach Area Reclamation Project is injected into the ground after oil is extracted, which helps prevent the ground from sinking, according to the project sponsor. Having access to a secure source of reused water can attract data centers and other businesses that require large amounts of water to areas that can guarantee access to reused water, according to a project sponsor and representatives from a nongovernmental water reuse organization we interviewed. Habitat restoration. Some Title XVI projects use reused water to restore wetlands or supply water to recreational lakes. For example, in California’s Napa Valley, reused water from the North Bay Title XVI project is being used to restore the Napa Sonoma Salt Marsh. Some threatened and endangered species, such as the Chinook Salmon, have started returning to the area since the restoration began, according to the project sponsor. Reused water from this Title XVI project also provides other habitat benefits. For example, wineries in the area that irrigate with reused water do not need to divert as much water from streams, which leaves more water for fish, according to the project sponsor. In addition, the North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program in California’s San Joaquin Valley supplies reused water to wildlife refuges and wetlands, in addition to agricultural lands. This area has the largest remaining freshwater marsh in the western United States, which provides critical habitat for migratory birds as well as other species, according to the project sponsor (see fig. 6). There are also several potable projects that have been funded by Title XVI. These projects generally fall into two categories: (1) indirect-potable reuse and (2) desalination. Indirect-potable reuse. Title XVI has provided grants for indirect-potable projects, in which wastewater undergoes advanced treatment to obtain potable-quality water. The water is then injected into an environmental buffer, such as a groundwater aquifer, where it is left for a certain amount of time before it is extracted. The water is treated again before it is distributed as drinking water. One use for highly-treated reused water is for seawater barriers, where water is injected into the ground to prevent the intrusion of high-salinity water into groundwater aquifers. Indirect- potable reuse has been gaining prominence, according to some project sponsors and representatives from nongovernmental water reuse organizations, with Title XVI grants going to several project sponsors for both the construction of facilities as well as research into optimal treatment methods. For example, the Groundwater Replenishment System in Orange County, California, which was partially funded by Title XVI, takes highly-treated wastewater that would have previously been discharged into the Pacific Ocean and purifies it using an advanced treatment process. The water is then injected into a groundwater aquifer and is later extracted as drinking water that serves more than 800,000 people, according to the project sponsor. Figure 7 shows reused water at several different points in the treatment process and reverse osmosis treatment equipment at Orange County’s Groundwater Replenishment System. Desalination. Title XVI has provided grants for projects that treat brackish groundwater—water that has a salinity above freshwater but below seawater—and then feed it directly into potable water distribution systems or into a groundwater aquifer or surface water reservoir. For example, the Mission Basin Groundwater Purification Facility in Oceanside, California, desalinates brackish groundwater using reverse osmosis and other treatment methods. The reused water supplies about 15 percent of the city’s water needs, according to the project sponsor. In addition to Title XVI construction projects, Reclamation’s feasibility and research studies also vary in their planned uses of reused water. For example, one feasibility study project sponsor we interviewed was awarded a Title XVI grant to investigate the feasibility and potential impacts of reusing produced water from oil and gas operations in Oklahoma. The study plans to investigate possible dual benefits of reusing produced water, including (1) providing a new source of water for irrigation and other purposes and (2) reducing the disposal of produced water as a possible means for addressing increased seismic activity associated with oil and gas operations, according to the project sponsor. Another feasibility study project sponsor we interviewed from a rural, landlocked community in Washington State is investigating the feasibility of creating a virtual zero discharge system that would eliminate all wastewater disposal by reusing the wastewater. Similar to feasibility studies, Title XVI research studies address different topics. For example, one project sponsor we interviewed was researching how to optimize filtration of reused water using membrane filtration, which is a critical treatment process to reduce contaminants in water. Another project sponsor was researching impediments and incentives to using reused water for agricultural irrigation. Based on our review of agency documents, project sponsors in 12 of the 18 states eligible to participate in the Title XVI program were awarded at least one type of funding under Title XVI since the inception of the program in 1992, as shown in table 3. From fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2017, Reclamation awarded about $640 million—or about 90 percent of total awarded Title XVI funding—to projects in California, the majority of which was for construction projects. The concentration of projects in California reflects the early emphasis of the Title XVI program on Southern California and reducing its reliance on water provided by the Colorado River, as well as the high level of interest in the program in the state, according to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report. Overall, project sponsors in 9 states were awarded feasibility study grants, sponsors in 4 states were awarded research study grants, and sponsors in 8 states were awarded construction grants (see fig. 8). Title XVI projects and studies include western urban and rural areas. In particular, many Title XVI projects are sponsored by entities in urban areas that serve a large population base. For example, the main part of the Los Angeles Area Water Supply Title XVI project is sponsored by the West Basin Municipal Water District, which has a service area of nearly 1 million people in 17 cities and unincorporated areas in Los Angeles County. This Title XVI project produces five different types of reused water to meet the unique needs of West Basin’s municipal, commercial, and industrial reuse customers, according to the project sponsor. Similarly, the City of San Diego, which has a population of about 1.4 million, was awarded Title XVI grants for a number of projects, including an indirect-potable reuse project anticipated to provide one-third of San Diego’s water supply by 2035, according to the project sponsor. Other Title XVI projects are sponsored by entities in rural areas and small cities. For example, the Hi-Desert Water District project serves a rural and economically disadvantaged community in the town of Yucca Valley, California, that has a population of about 20,000. This Title XVI project will fund facilities to collect, treat, and reuse treated wastewater, thereby eliminating degradation of the local groundwater supply and helping ensure a safer, reliable water supply for this community, according to the project sponsor. Similarly, the city of Round Rock, Texas, which has a population of about 120,000, sponsored the Williamson County Title XVI project. This project produces reused water for landscape irrigation, most of which is used to irrigate a 650-acre park, according to the project sponsor. Some Title XVI projects are sponsored by regional partnerships composed of different local entities. For example, in the late 1990s, 4 entities in Northern San Diego County—Carlsbad Municipal Water District, Leucadia Wastewater District, Olivenhain Municipal Water District, and San Elijo Joint Powers Authority—formed a coalition to leverage their water reuse programs; the coalition has since grown to 10 entities. This coalition sponsored an individually congressionally authorized Title XVI project, the North San Diego County project, and applied for a Title XVI grant for a new project eligible under the WIIN Act in fiscal year 2017. Similarly, in the northern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, 10 local agencies formed a regional partnership covering 315 square miles across Sonoma, Marin, and Napa Counties to sponsor the North Bay Water Reuse Program. According to the project sponsors involved in this regional partnership, using a regional partnership approach to water reuse projects provides an economy of scale; maximizes the ability to obtain local, state, and federal funding for the projects; and allows smaller, local entities to access funding and expertise for projects that would be out of reach without regional collaboration. See appendix I for more detailed information on specific Title XVI construction projects. Reclamation’s process for selecting projects and studies to award grants under the Title XVI program involves announcing the funding opportunity, establishing criteria to evaluate potential projects, and reviewing applications to make award decisions. We found that this process is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations outlined in OMB’s Uniform Guidance, based on our review of agency documents and federal grant regulations. The criteria Reclamation uses to evaluate Title XVI projects have changed in recent years, with the elimination or addition of some criteria and changes in the weighting of others. To start its selection process, Reclamation announces funding opportunities by developing annual funding opportunity announcements (FOA), which are publicly available on its website and on www.grants.gov. These FOAs contain information for applicants to consider prior to applying, including the types of eligible projects and studies, estimated funding available, information on the application review process, the application due date, and the criteria that Reclamation will use to score applications. Project sponsors submit applications for Title XVI grants to Reclamation in response to the FOAs, according to Reclamation officials. Reclamation officials then review the applications to ensure the projects are eligible and that applications are complete, according to agency officials we interviewed and documents we reviewed related to the selection process. Next, an application review committee scores eligible applications. The application review committee is composed of Reclamation staff representing the five regions and other staff with technical expertise. Committee members individually review and score each Title XVI application based on the evaluation criteria in the FOA. After the individual scoring, the application review committee meets collectively to discuss the scores; this meeting is generally facilitated by Title XVI program staff from Reclamation’s central office in Denver. If there are any outliers in the scores—e.g., if a committee member scores an application significantly higher or lower than the other members—then they are to discuss and may adjust the score to help ensure fairness and consistency in how the applications are scored relative to the evaluation criteria, according to agency officials. Following this discussion, Reclamation averages the members’ scores for each application and then ranks the applications based on the average scores. Reclamation creates a list of recommended projects and funding amounts for these projects, based on the rankings and congressional direction on the amount of funding for the Title XVI program in any given year. Reclamation’s process for selecting projects and studies to fund under the Title XVI program is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations outlined in the Uniform Guidance. Based on our review of Title XVI FOAs from fiscal years 2011 through 2018, all FOAs met the requirements prescribed by the Uniform Guidance. Specifically, the Uniform Guidance requires that grant funding opportunities be publicly announced and contain certain information, such as the evaluation criteria, key dates, and the process used to evaluate applications. Based on our review of FOAs, Reclamation’s FOAs were publicly announced and contained this information. Many project sponsors we interviewed said that Reclamation’s Title XVI application selection process is generally clear and well-managed and that Reclamation officials, at both the regional level and central office in Denver, were responsive and transparent throughout the selection process. Several project sponsors noted that Reclamation offered to debrief with Title XVI applicants after it made its grant selections; further, Reclamation officials provided constructive feedback to applicants to improve their applications in future years. Some project sponsors raised concerns about how long it takes WIIN Act- eligible Title XVI projects to be awarded grants. In particular, the WIIN Act provides that WIIN Act-eligible projects can only receive funding if an enacted appropriations act designates funding by project name, after Reclamation has recommended specific projects for funding and transmitted its recommendations to Congress. Given the timing of Reclamation’s FOA process, WIIN Act-eligible projects selected in a given fiscal year generally need to be included in the subsequent fiscal year’s appropriations act. For example, congressional direction in May 2017 provided that $10 million of the total Title XVI funding was to go to Title XVI WIIN Act-eligible projects, and Reclamation sent Congress its fiscal year 2017 selections for WIIN Act-eligible projects to fund in November 2017. However, according to Reclamation officials, Reclamation could not begin awarding fiscal year 2017 funding to selected projects until March 2018, after enactment of the fiscal year 2018 appropriations act, which listed the selected projects by name. One project sponsor noted that this two-part process created challenges related to the project timeline and budget. Reclamation officials said that project sponsors have also expressed concerns to Reclamation about how any resulting delays may affect the ability of projects to move forward. Reclamation officials noted that this is a statutory requirement and that they had discussed this process with project sponsors to make them aware of the timing for the grants. Reclamation has changed the evaluation criteria it uses to select projects to fund under the Title XVI program since it began using a competitive process in fiscal year 2011. Reclamation first developed criteria for the annual Title XVI project selection process in 2010, which it applied starting in fiscal year 2011. Prior to that, Congress generally provided project-specific funding direction for individually authorized Title XVI projects. According to agency officials, Reclamation developed the initial evaluation criteria for the annual Title XVI selection process based on (1) the language in the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Studies and Facilities Act, as amended; (2) Reclamation goals and priorities for the program; and (3) the criteria Reclamation used to select projects to fund under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Reclamation sought and incorporated public comments on the criteria in 2010. After that, Reclamation’s evaluation criteria for Title XVI construction projects generally remained unchanged from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, Reclamation eliminated some criteria in the Title XVI FOAs for construction projects, added some new criteria, and changed the weighting of some criteria, based on our review of FOAs for those years. For example, in 2017, Reclamation more than doubled the weight of the economic criterion for the fiscal year 2017 FOA for WIIN Act-eligible projects, making it worth 35 percent of the points as compared to the previous 13 percent. Reclamation officials told us that these changes were made in response to the language of the WIIN Act— which listed a number of criteria for projects, including projects that provide multiple benefits—and comments they received from OMB during the review process for the revised criteria. In March 2018, Reclamation proposed further revisions to the evaluation criteria for the fiscal year 2018 Title XVI program and held a public comment period to solicit input on the proposed changes. The proposed FOA contained one set of criteria applicable to both types of eligible Title XVI construction projects—individually congressionally authorized and WIIN Act-eligible projects. Reclamation received 21 comment letters on the criteria and, after analyzing the comments, officials said that they made additional changes to some of the criteria before issuing the final fiscal year 2018 FOA on May 30, 2018. For example, Reclamation added clarification to the economic criteria. See appendix II for a more detailed description of the final fiscal year 2018 Title XVI criteria, as well as changes to the criteria in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Several project sponsors noted that changes to the evaluation criteria may affect which projects are more competitive in Reclamation’s application scoring and project selection process. In particular, several project sponsors and representatives from nongovernmental organizations we interviewed told us they believed that recent changes— particularly the increased weight on economic criteria, including cost effectiveness—may disadvantage small projects. Others said increasing the weight on cost effectiveness may disadvantage new projects that are just beginning construction of costly new treatment facilities versus projects that are expanding existing facilities. Reclamation officials we interviewed stated that the economic criteria take into account the extent to which projects would provide multiple benefits—not just cost effectiveness. They also pointed out that they clarified in the fiscal year 2018 FOA that there are a number of ways to provide information on project benefits in Title XVI applications, including by describing benefits in a qualitative manner. They added that feedback from project sponsors had been positive on the additional changes Reclamation made in response to earlier stakeholder comments on the economic criteria for the final fiscal year 2018 FOA. Furthermore, Reclamation’s increased emphasis on economic criteria is consistent with federal principles on federal spending for water infrastructure projects, which states that federal infrastructure investments are to be based on systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs. To monitor Title XVI grants, Reclamation reviews financial and performance reports submitted by project sponsors, regularly communicates and visits with project sponsors to obtain information on the status of the projects, and collects information on the amount of water Title XVI projects deliver each year, which is included in Interior’s annual performance report. Financial and Performance Reports. In its financial assistance agreements for Title XVI grants, Reclamation generally requires project sponsors to submit financial and performance reports. Specifically, Reclamation generally requires that project sponsors submit financial and performance reports at least once per year and sometimes more frequently, as determined by the risk that each project poses, according to agency officials. Based on our review of reports, the financial reports list transactions related to Title XVI grants, such as expenditures, and the performance reports provide updates on the status of the Title XVI projects. Reclamation delineates its monitoring requirements, which generally include requirements for financial and performance reports, in the financial assistance agreements for Title XVI grants that each project sponsor agrees to prior to receiving funding. In our review of documents related to Reclamation’s monitoring process for Title XVI construction grants active in fiscal year 2017, we found that project sponsors submitted all but one financial and performance reports that Reclamation had required, and submitted all but two by their due date or within 2 weeks of this date. We found that Reclamation’s requirements are consistent with relevant federal grant regulations in OMB’s Uniform Guidance, which provide that federal awarding agencies, including Reclamation, generally are to collect financial reports from project sponsors at least annually. Ongoing Communication and Site Visits. To further monitor the performance of Title XVI grants, Reclamation officials communicate regularly with project sponsors via telephone and email and conduct site visits to obtain information on the status of the projects, according to Reclamation officials and project sponsors. Based on our review of agency guidance, Reclamation generally is to conduct at least one site visit per year for projects with significant on-the-ground activities, such as construction projects. During the visits, agency officials generally are to receive updates on progress made on the project and determine if it is on schedule and meets the scope of work identified in the financial assistance agreement. Reclamation generally requires officials to document these visits and other monitoring activities in project files, according to agency documents. Through the site visits and other communication with project sponsors, agency officials may also provide information on program requirements and respond to project sponsors’ questions about the Title XVI program. For example, during site visits, Reclamation officials have responded to project sponsors’ questions about the status of payments and allowable project costs and clarified requirements for financial and performance reports, according to our review of agency documents and interviews with project sponsors. In our review of Reclamation’s Title XVI construction grants active in fiscal year 2017, we found that Reclamation generally conducted annual site visits for Title XVI construction projects that year. We found that this is consistent with federal grant regulations in OMB’s Uniform Guidance, which state that federal awarding agencies may make site visits as warranted by program needs. Data Collection. Reclamation also annually collects data on the amount of water delivered from each Title XVI construction project, as well as projected water deliveries for the coming year. Reclamation analyzes the water delivery data, compares projected data to actual deliveries, and follows up with project sponsors to understand any discrepancies, according to agency officials. For example, actual water deliveries could be lower than projected deliveries if communities implement water conservation measures that result in projects having less wastewater to treat and deliver for reuse. According to Reclamation officials, information on the amount of reused water delivered from Title XVI projects helps them to monitor progress on Title XVI projects and helps demonstrate the benefits and accomplishments of the Title XVI program. These data are consolidated and included in Interior’s annual performance report to demonstrate how the agency is meeting Interior’s objective of achieving a more sustainable and secure water supply. Collecting data on Title XVI water deliveries is consistent with the Title XVI program’s purpose of supporting water supply sustainability by providing financial and technical assistance to local water agencies for the planning, design, and construction of water reuse projects.

GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This appendix provides information on construction projects that are individually congressionally authorized under the Bureau of Reclamation’s Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program (Title XVI), as well as projects to which Reclamation awarded grants under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act) funding opportunity in fiscal year 2017. Figure 9 below provides information on the 53 construction projects that have been individually authorized by Congress under the Title XVI program. The projects are ordered by the total amount of Title XVI funding each was awarded from fiscal years 1992 through 2017, from highest to lowest. Figure 10 below provides information on the three construction projects to which Reclamation awarded grants under the Title XVI WIIN Act funding opportunity in fiscal year 2017. The projects are ordered by the total Title XVI funding each was awarded in fiscal year 2017—the first year that grants were awarded under the WIIN Act—from highest to lowest. This appendix provides detailed information on the evaluation criteria the Bureau of Reclamation used to select projects to award grants under the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program (Title XVI). The six evaluation criteria Reclamation used to select construction projects to fund in fiscal year 2018 are as follows (points are out of a total of 110 points). 1. Water Supply (35 points) a. Stretching Water Supplies (18 points): Points will be awarded based on the extent to which the project is expected to secure and stretch reliable water supplies. Consideration will be given to the amount of water expected to be made available by the project and the extent to which the project will reduce demands on existing facilities and otherwise reduce water diversions. b. Contributions to Water Supply Reliability (17 points): Points will be awarded for projects that contribute to a more reliable water supply. 2. Environment and Water Quality (12 points): Points will be awarded based on the extent to which the project will improve surface, groundwater, or effluent discharge quality; will restore or enhance habitat for nonlisted species; will address problems caused by invasive species; or will provide water or habitat for federally listed threatened or endangered species. Indirect benefits of the project will also be considered under this criterion. 3. Economic Benefits (35 points) a. Cost Effectiveness (10 points): Points will be awarded based on the cost per acre-foot of water expected to be delivered upon completion of the project and how the cost of the project compares to a nonreclaimed water alternative. b. Economic Analysis and Project Benefits (25 points): Points will be awarded based on the analysis of the project’s benefits relative to the project’s costs. 4. Department of Interior Priorities (10 Points): Points will be awarded based on the extent that the proposal demonstrates that the project supports the Department of the Interior priorities, such as utilizing natural resources and modernizing infrastructure. 5. Reclamation’s Obligations and Benefits to Rural or Economically Disadvantaged Communities (8 points) a. Legal and Contractual Water Supply Obligations (4 Points): Points will be awarded for projects that help to meet Reclamation’s legal and contractual obligations. b. Benefits to Rural or Economically Disadvantaged Communities (4 Points): Points will be awarded based on the extent to which the project serves rural communities or economically disadvantaged communities in rural or urban areas. 6. Watershed Perspective (10 Points): Points will be awarded based on the extent to which the project promotes or applies a watershed perspective by implementing an integrated resources management approach, implementing a regional planning effort, forming collaborative partnerships with other entities, or conducting public outreach. Reclamation changed some of its evaluation criteria in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The fiscal year 2017 changes were made in response to requirements in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act)—which listed several criteria for projects, including projects that provide multiple benefits—and comments from the Office of Management and Budget, according to Reclamation officials. The fiscal year 2018 changes were generally made in response to comments Reclamation received during the formal comment period it held in March and April 2018 to solicit input on the criteria, according to Reclamation officials. The changes to the criteria are shown in table 4. In addition to the individual named above, Elizabeth Erdmann (Assistant Director), Lesley Rinner (Analyst-in-Charge), Margaret Childs, and Sierra Hicks made key contributions to this report. Ellen Fried, Timothy Guinane, Thomas M. James, John Mingus, Patricia Moye, Anne Rhodes-Kline, Sheryl Stein, and Sara Sullivan made additional contributions.", "answers": ["Population growth and drought are among the factors that have placed increasing demands on the U.S. water supply, particularly in the arid West. The reuse of wastewater can help address water management challenges by treating water that is typically unusable and then reusing it for beneficial purposes, such as irrigation, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Reclamation's Title XVI program awards grants for the study and construction of water reuse projects in 17 western states and Hawaii. From fiscal years 1992 through 2009, Congress individually authorized some Title XVI projects. In 2016, Congress amended the Title XVI program to allow grants to be awarded to additional water reuse projects. GAO was asked to review the Title XVI program. This report describes, among other things, for the Title XVI program (1) grants Reclamation has awarded for projects and studies and remaining projects that are eligible for grants, (2) the types and locations of projects and studies that have received grants, and (3) Reclamation's process for selecting projects and studies and its consistency with federal grant regulations as well as how the program's evaluation criteria have changed since 2011. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency guidance; analyzed financial data for fiscal years 1992 through 2017; compared documents related to the project selection process against federal grant regulations; and interviewed agency officials and nonfederal project sponsors with different types of projects. The Bureau of Reclamation, within the Department of the Interior, awarded about $715 million in water reuse grants for 46 construction projects and 71 studies under the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program (Title XVI) from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2017, according to agency documents. Most of the Title XVI funding—about $703 million—has been awarded for construction projects. Some construction projects remain eligible for Title XVI grant funding. About $464 million in eligible Title XVI grant funding not yet awarded remains for projects that Congress individually authorized; for projects eligible under the 2016 amendments to the Title XVI program, about $513 million remains. Title XVI projects and studies cover various uses for reused water. For example, many projects GAO reviewed produce reused water for landscape and agricultural irrigation, as well as water that may later be extracted for drinking water, as shown in the figure. Title XVI projects are located in western urban and rural areas, with California accounting for 36 construction projects. Reclamation's process to select Title XVI projects and studies to receive grants involves announcing the funding opportunity, establishing criteria to evaluate potential projects, and reviewing applications to make award decisions, according to agency documents GAO reviewed. GAO found that Reclamation's grant award process is consistent with relevant federal regulations for awarding grants. For example, the Title XVI funding opportunity announcements GAO reviewed contained information required by the regulations, such as the criteria used to evaluate applications. In recent years, Reclamation has changed the criteria it uses to evaluate projects, eliminating or adding some criteria and changing the weighting of others. Reclamation officials said that these changes were made in part in response to statutory changes."], "length": 7852, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e48a970bf10bbd3d38cc0790fc2c1be600aacbfceefc2ce5"}
{"input": "", "context": "T his report examines the President's authority to terminate the United States' international obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) without further action from Congress. It also examines whether the NAFTA Implementation Act, the primary federal statute that implements the agreement in domestic law, would remain in effect if the President successfully terminated U.S. obligations under the agreement. In analyzing these issues, the report focuses on three related questions: (1) whether, under international law, the President may terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA without congressional approval; (2) whether, under domestic law, the President, relying on constitutional or statutory authority, may terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA unilaterally; and (3) whether the NAFTA Implementation Act would remain in effect if the President successfully terminated U.S. international obligations under the agreement. NAFTA is an international trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that became effective on January 1, 1994. The agreement includes market-opening provisions that remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, as well as other rules affecting trade in areas such as agriculture, customs procedures, foreign investment, government procurement, intellectual property protection, and trade in services. The United States approved NAFTA as a congressional-executive agreement by a majority vote of each house of Congress, rather than as a treaty ratified by the President after Senate approval by a two-thirds majority vote. It was not a self-executing agreement; rather, implementing legislation was required to provide domestic legal authorities with the power to enforce and comply with the agreement's provisions. Congress approved and implemented NAFTA in domestic law in the NAFTA Implementation Act. Although many U.S. obligations under NAFTA were already implemented in domestic law prior to Congress's enactment of the NAFTA Implementation Act, Congress delegated rulemaking authority to the President and various federal agencies in the Act so that they could further implement NAFTA in domestic law by promulgating executive orders, proclamations, or regulations. The NAFTA implementing legislation contemplates certain limited changes to certain provisions of NAFTA (e.g., certain rules of origin) in accordance with NAFTA's rules for minor amendments to the text of the agreement and limited congressional delegations of authority to the President to implement such changes in U.S. law. On May 18, 2017, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Robert Lighthizer notified Congress that the Administration intended to renegotiate NAFTA. More than a year later, following the conclusion of the negotiations, President Trump signed a proposed replacement for NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA), along with his counterparts from Canada and Mexico. The new agreement addressed a variety of issues, including changes to rules of origin for automotive trade; intellectual property rights protections; digital trade; limitations on the scope of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions; and certain provisions on agricultural trade. President Trump has at times suggested that he will withdraw the United States from NAFTA unilaterally if Congress does not approve the USMCA. International law does not itself prohibit the President from unilaterally terminating the United States' obligations under NAFTA. NAFTA is a legally binding agreement under international law. In other words, NAFTA is a \"treaty\" under international law, a term that has a more expansive meaning than the same term when used in U.S. domestic practice. In this regard, it is important to distinguish \"treaty\" in the context of international law, in which \"treaty\" and \"international agreement\" are synonymous terms for all binding agreements, and \"treaty\" in the context of domestic American law, in which \"treaty\" may more narrowly refer to a particular subcategory of binding international agreements that receive the Senate's advice and consent. Part V of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Vienna Convention), which the United States has not ratified but considers to reflect, in many aspects, customary international law, provides rules for withdrawal of a party from a binding international agreement. Article 54 of the Vienna Convention provides that \"termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of a party may take place . . . in conformity with the provisions of the treaty . . . .\" Article 2205 of NAFTA, which Congress approved in the NAFTA Implementation Act, provides that a \"Party may withdraw from this Agreement six months after it provides written notice of withdrawal to the other Parties. If a Party withdraws, the Agreement shall remain in force for the remaining Parties.\" NAFTA does not address whether, in the context of the United States' withdrawal from the agreement, the term \"Party\" includes both the President and Congress acting together to accomplish withdrawal. In addition, neither the other provisions of the agreement, the context in which they appear, nor the subsequent practice of the NAFTA parties sheds light on the issue. In the absence of language to the contrary in NAFTA Article 2205, the Vienna Convention applies. Article 67 of the Vienna Convention provides that: Any act of declaring invalid, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty pursuant to the provisions of the treaty . . . shall be carried out through an instrument communicated to the other parties. If the instrument is not signed by the Head of State, Head of Government or Minister for Foreign Affairs, the representative of the State communicating it may be called upon to produce full powers [i.e., a document showing that the representative has authority to terminate the agreement on behalf of the state]. It thus appears that if the President (i.e., the \"head of state\" for the United States) communicated a notice of withdrawal from NAFTA to Canada and Mexico, and such notice became effective at least six months later, it would terminate the United States' obligations under the agreement as a matter of international law. The withdrawal process under international law, however, may not account for the unique statutory, constitutional, and separation-of-powers principles related to withdrawal under U.S. domestic law, as discussed below. If the President sought to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA, an injured business or other party with standing to bring a lawsuit might seek an injunction from a U.S. federal court directing the executive branch to refrain from issuing a notice terminating U.S. obligations under NAFTA or a declaration from the court that such issuance is unlawful. It is difficult to predict how a court might resolve such a challenge, as U.S. courts have uniformly avoided answering whether the U.S. Constitution authorizes the President to terminate an international pact without express congressional approval. Instead, courts have left the executive and legislative branches to resolve disagreements over the termination power through the political process. While no court has considered a case involving a trade agreement approved as a congressional-executive agreement under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures, there is a significant possibility that a court would dismiss such a case for lack of jurisdiction. Congress could signal that it disputes the Executive's termination of U.S. NAFTA obligations to a court by enacting a law or resolution with a veto-proof majority opposing or purporting to block such action. If Congress passed such an act or resolution and the Executive still terminated NAFTA in direct derogation of that act or resolution, the legal paradigm governing the separation-of-powers analysis might shift. To resolve certain separation-of-powers conflicts, the Supreme Court typically applies the approach set forth in Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , which states that the President's constitutional powers often \"are not fixed but fluctuate, depending on their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.\" Justice Jackson's opinion sets forth a tripartite framework for evaluating the constitutional powers of the President. The President's authority is (1) at a maximum when acting pursuant to authorization by Congress; (2) in a \"zone of twilight\" when Congress and the President \"may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain,\" and Congress has not spoken on an issue; and (3) at its \"lowest ebb\" when taking measures incompatible with the will of Congress. Although Congress has not enacted a law or resolution prohibiting the President from terminating NAFTA unilaterally, such action could place the President's authority at the \"lowest ebb.\" In that scenario, the President may act in contravention of the will of Congress only in matters involving exclusive presidential prerogatives that are \"at once so conclusive and preclusive\" that they \"disabl[e] the Congress from acting upon the subject.\" Members of the executive branch have suggested that treaty termination is part of the President's plenary powers, but one could plausibly advance the counterargument that the legislative branch plays a shared role in the termination process, especially in matters that implicate Congress's enumerated powers, such as international trade. Assuming that a federal court found a case challenging the President's termination of NAFTA to be justiciable, it would likely evaluate the President's authority to take such action. Because Congress has not enacted a resolution or legislation disapproving of unilateral NAFTA termination, in order to terminate NAFTA without further congressional action, either (1) the President must possess plenary constitutional authority to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA, or (2) Congress must have authorized the President to take such action through legislation. Although the Constitution establishes a procedure whereby the Executive has the power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is silent as to how the United States may withdraw from treaties or congressional-executive agreements. Scholars have also noted that the framers of the Constitution never directly addressed the power to terminate treaties (or congressional-executive agreements) in the Federalist Papers , the Constitutional Convention debates, or the debates of the state ratifying conventions. In the absence of guidance from the text or original meaning of the Constitution, a court considering whether the President has the constitutional authority to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA without congressional approval would likely turn to other methods of constitutional interpretation. As discussed below, applying relevant methods of interpretation does not provide a clear answer as to whether the President possesses plenary constitutional authority to terminate U.S. obligations under NAFTA. One method of constitutional interpretation, known as structuralism, draws inferences from the design of the Constitution, including the relationships among the three branches of the federal government (commonly called separation of powers). In this vein, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution specifically gives Congress the authority to impose duties on imports of products from other countries and to \"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" By contrast, although the President may possess constitutional authority to negotiate trade agreements and communicate a notice of withdrawal from an agreement to trading partners, Article II gives the President no specific power over international commerce or trade. The manner in which the Constitution apportions power over international commerce, granting such power specifically to Congress, suggests that the President may simply lack authority to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA, which addresses commercial matters, without further congressional action. The Supreme Court, however, has interpreted Article II of the Constitution as granting the President the \"vast share of responsibility\" for conducting foreign relations. This authority includes, but also extends beyond, specific Article II powers to appoint ambassadors with advice and consent of the Senate; submit treaties to the Senate; ratify treaties; and act as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Courts and scholars generally accept that such authority includes the exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements and make official communications with foreign states. Because terminating the United States' NAFTA obligations implicates foreign relations and, more specifically, communication of a notice of withdrawal to foreign sovereigns (i.e., Canada and Mexico), one could argue that the design of the Constitution provides the President with independent power to terminate NAFTA unilaterally. Nonetheless, the President's preeminent role in communicating with foreign powers does not necessarily imply that he has authority to terminate a trade agreement without congressional consent. Long-established historical practices of the political branches may also be relevant to whether the President can terminate NAFTA unilaterally. In some cases, the United States has withdrawn from international legal agreements pursuant to the joint action of the political branches. However, beginning at the turn of the 20th century, the President has sometimes withdrawn unilaterally from an international agreement without the consent of Congress. Thus, general historical practice involving the termination of international agreements has been inconsistent, and therefore it may not be particularly helpful in resolving questions about the President's power to terminate trade agreements unilaterally. Defining the relevant historical practice more narrowly provides little guidance, as well. Historical experience with the suspension of modern free trade agreements (FTAs)—those subsequently approved and implemented in domestic law as congressional-executive agreements by a majority vote in both houses of Congress under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures—is limited. In fact, no U.S. FTA approved as a congressional-executive agreement under these procedures has been terminated. In the single instance involving suspension rather than termination of an FTA, Congress amended the act implementing the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement preceding NAFTA to suspend certain provisions in the act while allowing others to continue to operate. Although this historical practice concerns suspension of an FTA rather than termination, a court could interpret it to suggest that Congress may have a role in terminating U.S. international obligations under NAFTA. However, because it is a single instance and involves suspension rather than termination of an agreement, a court could also find it to provide little guidance on the President's authority in this context. The practical consequences of a court concluding that the President possesses the power to terminate a trade agreement unilaterally may also be relevant. Generally, a pragmatic approach to constitutional interpretation weighs the future costs and benefits of an interpretation to society or the political branches, selecting the interpretation that may lead to the perceived best outcome. However, it is difficult to predict which set of pragmatic arguments a court would find most persuasive. On the one hand, one could argue that the President should possess an exclusive power of unilateral termination because (1) the nation must have a \"single policy\" regarding which international trade agreements remain in effect, and (2) additional pronouncements from Congress on the issue could result in confusion for the United States and its trading partners. One might also arguably justify a unilateral termination power on the grounds that the United States needs a means to make decisive, quick, and clear decisions on withdrawal from NAFTA or other FTAs, particularly when another party has breached the agreement, and that it would make it easier for the President to threaten NAFTA partners with U.S. withdrawal from the agreement as a means of leverage to obtain concessions from them during renegotiation of the agreement. On the other hand, one could instead argue that a unilateral termination power would improperly allow a single actor (i.e., the President) to eliminate an international commercial agreement. In addition, the President's use of such a power could be viewed to undermine the United States' ability to make convincing international commitments in the realm of trade as well as other areas. Notwithstanding whether the President has plenary constitutional authority to terminate NAFTA, the President could terminate NAFTA without first seeking congressional approval if Congress has already given the Executive such authorization either expressly or by implication. It is unclear whether a court would find that Congress has implicitly approved of unilateral presidential termination of NAFTA obligations. Congress has enacted a detailed statutory framework for the negotiation, legislative consideration, and implementation of free trade agreements under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures. During the past few decades, Congress and the President have used this legal framework to conclude and implement 14 free trade agreements with 20 countries, including NAFTA. Given this extensive framework for legislative approval and implementation of trade agreements, a court might find it unlikely that Congress implicitly authorized the President to withdraw from NAFTA without further congressional action. On the other hand, the fact that Congress enacted a comprehensive statutory framework for entering into trade agreements, but not withdrawing from them, may indicate that Congress was not as concerned with the President's termination of U.S. obligations under the agreements. Nonetheless, some commentators have argued that Congress has specifically authorized the President to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA. In particular, these commentators have pointed to Sections 125 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, an act that, among other things, sets up the procedure for Congress's consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation, as potentially providing such authority. The following subsections of this report therefore analyze whether Sections 125 and 301 grant the President this termination authority. Some commentators have argued that Section 125(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to terminate U.S. NAFTA commitments. Congress specifically made this subsection applicable to NAFTA in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation for NAFTA. Section 125(a), titled \"Termination and Withdrawal Authority,\" which specifically addresses withdrawal from FTAs, provides the following: (a) Grant of authority for termination or withdrawal at end of period specified in agreement Every trade agreement entered into under [the Trade Act of 1974] shall be subject to termination, in whole or in part, or withdrawal, upon due notice, at the end of a period specified in the agreement. Such period shall be not more than 3 years from the date on which the agreement becomes effective. If the agreement is not terminated or withdrawn from at the end of the period so specified, it shall be subject to termination or withdrawal thereafter upon not more than 6 months' notice. If the President were to invoke Section 125(a) as authority for terminating U.S. international obligations under NAFTA, his actions might be challenged in federal court as exceeding the statutory authority delegated to him. Because no court has yet interpreted Section 125(a), the scope of the President's power under this provision would be an issue of first impression. In deciding whether Section 125(a) authorizes the President to terminate U.S. obligations under NAFTA, the court might consider several principles of statutory interpretation. First, a court would likely consider the ordinary meaning of the text. In this vein, the title of subsection (a) may provide some guidance. The title \"Grant of authority for termination or withdrawal at end of period specified in agreement\" may suggest that Congress's purpose in enacting Section 125(a) was to \"grant\" the President the authority to terminate the agreement in accordance with the withdrawal provision in NAFTA Article 2205 without the need for further legislation. However, the Supreme Court has stated that statutory headings and titles \"are not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text\" and that the title of an act \"cannot enlarge or confer powers.\" Although the title of subsection (a) may provide limited interpretive aid, it does not specify which political actor has withdrawal authority. Thus, it is unlikely that a court would view it as conferring authority on the President to terminate U.S. obligations under NAFTA. Turning to the text of Section 125(a), the provision states that agreements like NAFTA \"shall be subject to termination.\" The relevant dictionary definition of \"subject\" is \"contingent on or under the influence of some later action.\" To say that NAFTA is \"subject to\" termination means that it is capable of later being terminated but says nothing about which political actor(s) must terminate the agreement. This reading is supported by the canon of statutory construction that \"Congress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not . . . hide elephants in mouseholes.\" It seems unlikely that Congress would have \"hidden\" a delegation of authority to the President to terminate NAFTA in a vaguely worded provision. Rather, the ordinary meaning of Section 125(a) appears to require only that the text of the NAFTA agreement contain a provision allowing for its termination. Legislative history materials appear to confirm this reading of Section 125(a). These materials suggest that Section 125(a)'s purpose was to ensure that trade agreements entered into by the President contained language providing for termination or withdrawal at the end of a certain time period. This reading is suggested by the House Committee on Ways and Means report on a predecessor to Section 125, Section 2(b) of the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. Congress enacted that law to authorize the President to negotiate reciprocal agreements reducing barriers to international trade during the Great Depression in order to stimulate the domestic economy. The House committee report stated the following: The final provision of the bill under consideration deals with the amount of time during which a foreign trade agreement with another country may run. The provision is that such agreement must be terminable at the end of not more than 3 years. If it is not terminated at that time it must thereafter be terminable at any time upon not more than 6 month[s'] notice. The committee reports thus suggest that Section 125(a)'s purpose was to ensure that the trade agreements that the President entered into would be subject to termination or terminable . Under this reading, Section 125(a) does not appear to delegate authority to the President to terminate those agreements unilaterally by delivering notice of withdrawal to trading partners. One scholar has argued that Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to terminate U.S. obligations under NAFTA. Section 301 provides that the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), a federal agency within the Executive Office of the President, must take certain specified trade actions \"subject to the specific direction, if any, of the President regarding any such action\" when it finds, after conducting an investigation and following other procedures, that: (A) the rights of the United States under any trade agreement are being denied; or (B) an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country—(i) violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or (ii) is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce. Section 301 also provides the USTR with discretion to take \"all appropriate and feasible\" trade actions specifically authorized under subsection (c) when it finds that \"an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country is unreasonable or discriminatory and burdens or restricts United States commerce, and . . . action by the United States is appropriate.\" Section 301(c) provides a list of actions that the USTR may or must take in response to the unfair foreign trade practices. As relevant here, that list authorizes USTR to: (A) suspend, withdraw, or prevent the application of, benefits of trade agreement concessions to carry out a trade agreement with the foreign country [that is the subject of the Section 301 investigation]; (B) impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods of, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, fees or restrictions on the services of, such foreign country for such time as the Trade Representative determines appropriate . . . Notably, the list of actions in Section 301(c) does not explicitly include authorization for the Executive to deliver a notice of withdrawal from a trade agreement to U.S. trading partners and thereby terminate U.S. obligations under the agreement. Rather, as discussed further below, the legislative history of this provision, as recounted in committee reports, indicates that Congress merely intended the provision to provide the President broad authority to take action against unfair foreign trade practices by imposing various barriers to trade under domestic law, including by suspending or terminating individual trade concessions. The text and legislative history do not appear to suggest that Section 301(c) more broadly authorizes the USTR to terminate a trade agreement. However, as discussed below, the Executive might exercise the authority in Section 301 to establish significant barriers to trade with Canada and Mexico. Accordingly, if the USTR were to interpret Section 301(c) as authorizing it to terminate a trade agreement, it would appear that its actions would fall outside of the statutory authority delegated to the agency. It should be noted that courts reviewing specific USTR actions under Section 301 have in the past accorded \"substantial deference to decisions of the Trade Representative implicating the discretionary authority of the President in matters of foreign relations,\" including the USTR's selection of a remedy following a Section 301 investigation. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviews the USTR's actions under Section 301, has held that, under the Administrative Procedure Act, \"[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.\" Furthermore, a court may hold agency action unlawful when there has been \"a clear misconstruction of the governing statute\" or \"action outside delegated authority.\" Because the text and legislative history of Section 301 indicate that Congress merely intended the provision to furnish the Executive with broad authority to take action against unfair foreign trade practices by imposing various barriers to trade under domestic law, it seems unlikely that a court would accord deference to a USTR interpretation that Section 301 authorizes the President to deliver notice of termination to Canada or Mexico. Although neither Section 125 nor Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 appears to authorize the Executive to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA, these statutory provisions appear to grant broad authority to the executive branch to impose barriers to trade on goods and services from Canada and Mexico under domestic law. For example, the text and legislative history of Section 125(b)-(f) suggest that Congress intended to provide the President with broad authority to terminate various presidential proclamations implementing a trade agreement in domestic law (e.g., proclamations implementing tariff reductions) and to impose trade barriers in order to, for example, respond to a breach of the agreement by another party. And the text and legislative history of Section 301, as recounted in committee reports, indicate that the provision was intended to provide the Executive with broad authority to effect the temporary suspension or withdrawal of individual trade concessions accorded by the United States to the goods and services of trading partners while a trade agreement remained in effect. Although such provisions appear to furnish the executive branch with broad authority to suspend or terminate individual trade concessions, the Executive's actions under these provisions could be subject to challenge before international and domestic tribunals. For example, the Executive's imposition of trade barriers pursuant to such authorities may place the United States in breach of its obligations under other international agreements, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements. If a dispute proceeded to a WTO panel, and the panel rendered an adverse decision against the United States, the United States would be expected to remove the offending measure, generally within a reasonable period of time, or face the possibility of paying compensation to the complaining member or being subject to sanctions. Such sanctions might include the complaining member imposing higher duties on imports of selected products from the United States. However, a WTO Member could begin to impose its own duties on selected U.S. exports without awaiting the outcome of a dispute settlement proceeding. In addition, a domestic court might consider whether, in exercising authority under Section 125, the President acted within the scope of his delegated powers as defined by the terms of the statute, or whether the President's actions were proportional to the circumstances cited to justify them. As a further example, a federal court could review USTR's Section 301 actions under the Administrative Procedure Act to determine whether they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" A reviewing court might consider, for example, whether the USTR's Section 301 actions involved \"a clear misconstruction of the governing statute,\" \"a significant procedural violation,\" or \"action outside delegated authority.\" The NAFTA Implementation Act, the primary federal statute that implements NAFTA in domestic law, would likely remain in effect if the President successfully terminated the United States' international obligations under NAFTA unilaterally. Under Supreme Court precedent, the repealing of statutes generally must conform to the same bicameral and presentment process set forth in Article I that is used to enact new legislation. For example, in Clinton v. City of New York , the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act (LIVA), a law that authorized the President, within five days of signing a bill into law, to make partial cancellation of certain tax and spending provisions in the law if the President determined certain criteria were met. The Court held that the LIVA violated the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution because the President could effectively repeal acts of Congress without going through the regular legislative process involving House and Senate passage of legislation and presentment of it to the President for his signature or veto. Nonetheless, the Court has recognized Congress's authority to enact contingent legislation that provides for the alteration of a law's effect based on a condition that arises after the law is enacted. It should be noted that Sections 109(b) and 415 of the NAFTA Implementation Act contain language that could be read to effect the repeal of certain provisions of the NAFTA Implementation Act under specific circumstances. Specifically, section 109(b) states the following: (b) TERMINATION OF NAFTA STATUS—During any period in which a country ceases to be a NAFTA country, sections 101 through 106 shall cease to have effect with respect to such country. Section 415(a) provides similar language with respect to certain provisions addressing dispute settlement in antidumping and countervailing duty cases in Title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act: IN GENERAL—Except as provided in subsection (b)[, which contains transitional provisions], on the date on which a country ceases to be a NAFTA country, the provisions of this title (other than this section) and the amendments made by this title shall cease to have effect with respect to that country. The NAFTA Implementation Act defines \"NAFTA country\" as those countries (i.e., Canada and Mexico) (1) to which the agreement is in force and (2) to which the United States \"applies the Agreement.\" The text and legislative history of Sections 109(b) and 415 of the NAFTA Implementation Act indicate that Congress intended these sections to trigger automatic termination of certain provisions of the Act with respect to Canada or Mexico when either country withdrew from NAFTA but the United States remained a party. However, it is unclear what language in either of these provisions would afford the President the authority to terminate the agreement without such conduct by Canada or Mexico. Moreover, interpreting Sections 109(b) and 415 to provide for the automatic termination of certain provisions in the NAFTA Implementation Act when the President unilaterally terminates U.S. NAFTA obligations under international law would appear to violate a key canon of statutory construction that holds that if one plausible reading of a statute would raise questions about the statute's constitutionality, a court should look for another, \"fairly possible\" reading that would avoid the constitutional issue. Interpreting Sections 109(b) and 415 to authorize the President to terminate portions of the NAFTA Implementation Act by withdrawing the United States from NAFTA would raise the question of whether Congress's delegation of such authority to the President violates separation-of-powers principles by contravening the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which, as noted above, requires that legislation be passed by Congress and presented to the President for his signature or veto in order to become law. Accordingly, a more likely reading of Sections 109(b) and 415 would likely be that certain provisions of the NAFTA Implementation Act cease to have effect with respect to Canada or Mexico if either country withdraws from NAFTA but the United States remains a party. Therefore, absent further congressional action, the United States' withdrawal from NAFTA alone appears unlikely to trigger Sections 109(b) and 415 or render the NAFTA Implementation Act ineffective. Notably, even if the NAFTA Implementation Act remains in effect, other provisions of federal law (e.g., Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974) may grant the President or a federal agency authority to restrict trade with Canada or Mexico. As noted, such actions would likely be subject to judicial review on various grounds.", "answers": ["NAFTA is an international trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that became effective on January 1, 1994. The agreement includes market-opening provisions that remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, as well as other rules affecting trade in areas such as agriculture, customs procedures, foreign investment, government procurement, intellectual property protection, and trade in services. Congress approved and implemented NAFTA in domestic law in the NAFTA Implementation Act (P.L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057). On May 18, 2017, U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer notified Congress that the Administration intended to renegotiate NAFTA. More than a year later, following the conclusion of the negotiations, President Trump signed a proposed replacement for NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA), along with his counterparts from Canada and Mexico. President Trump has at times suggested that he will withdraw the United States from NAFTA unilaterally if Congress does not approve the USMCA. This report examines the President's authority to terminate the United States' international obligations under NAFTA without further action from Congress. It also examines whether the NAFTA Implementation Act, the primary federal statute that implements the agreement in domestic law, would remain in effect if the President successfully terminated U.S. obligations under the agreement. In analyzing these issues, the report focuses on three related questions: (1) whether, under international law, the President may terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA without congressional approval; (2) whether, under domestic law, the President, relying on constitutional or statutory authority, may terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA unilaterally; and (3) whether the NAFTA Implementation Act would remain in effect if the President successfully terminated U.S. international obligations under the agreement. With regard to the first question, under international law, the President appears to be able to terminate the United States' international obligations under NAFTA without congressional approval by delivering six months' notice of withdrawal to Canada and Mexico, provided such notice later becomes effective (e.g., assuming that a court does not enjoin the Executive from issuing the notice or declare such issuance unlawful). The answer to the second question is less clear, however, and would require a reviewing court to confront several complicated issues of first impression, including the scope of the President's constitutional authority and statutory authority to terminate an international agreement. Justiciability questions may prevent a court from definitively answering the constitutional questions, leaving the resolution of the President's constitutional authority to the political process. With regard to the statutory question, while legal commentators have raised various arguments with respect to the President's domestic legal authority to terminate U.S. NAFTA international obligations unilaterally, it does not appear that any statute expressly affords the President with the authority to terminate NAFTA on his own. It is unclear whether Congress's enactment of an extensive legal framework providing for legislative consideration, approval, and implementation of trade agreements indicates that Congress did not intend to authorize the President implicitly to withdraw from NAFTA without further congressional action. Nonetheless, as explained below, provisions of federal law such as Sections 125 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 may provide the Executive with broad authority to suspend individual trade concessions granted to NAFTA countries and thereby establish barriers to trade with Canada and Mexico. At the same time, the Executive's use of such authority would, however, likely be subject to review on various grounds by domestic or international tribunals. Finally, whether the NAFTA Implementation Act would remain in effect after termination of U.S. obligations under NAFTA would be informed by Supreme Court precedent generally requiring the repeal of statutes to conform to the same bicameral process set forth in Article I of the Constitution that is used to enact new legislation. Accordingly, as an initial matter, it would appear that the President lacks authority to terminate the domestic effect of the NAFTA Implementation Act without going through the full legislative process for repeal. Thus, the Act appears to remain in effect unless Congress has, consistent with the Constitution, delegated to the President authority to terminate its provisions or made such provisions \"self-terminating.\""], "length": 6036, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0cc65ede09b9e7b90e4cfae55ff5fd655dcb080ff695cca5"}
{"input": "", "context": "T he federal government has two major tools for affecting the macroeconomy: fiscal policy and monetary policy. These policy interventions are generally used to either increase or decrease economic activity to counter the business cycle's impact on unemployment, income, and inflation. This report focuses on fiscal policy; for more information related to monetary policy, refer to CRS Report RL30354, Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve: Current Policy and Conditions , by Marc Labonte. Fiscal policy is the means by which the government adjusts its budget balance through spending and revenue changes to influence broader economic conditions. According to mainstream economics, the government can impact the level of economic activity, generally measured by gross domestic product (GDP), in the short term by changing its level of spending and tax revenue. Expansionary fiscal policy—an increase in government spending, a decrease in tax revenue, or a combination of the two—is expected to spur economic activity, whereas contractionary fiscal policy—a decrease in government spending, an increase in tax revenue, or a combination of the two—is expected to slow economic activity. When the government's budget is running a deficit, fiscal policy is said to be expansionary: when it is running a surplus, fiscal policy is said to be contractionary. From a policymaker's perspective, expansionary fiscal policy is generally used to boost GDP growth and the economic indicators that tend to move with GDP, such as employment and individual incomes. However, expansionary fiscal policy also tends to affect interest rates and investment, exchange rates and the trade balance, and the inflation rate in undesirable ways, limiting the long-term effectiveness of persistent fiscal stimulus. Contractionary fiscal policy can be used to slow economic activity if policymakers are concerned that the economy may be overheating, which can cause a recession. The magnitude of fiscal policy's effect on GDP will also differ based on where the economy is within the business cycle—whether it is in a recession or an expansion. During a recession, aggregate demand (overall spending) in the economy falls, which generally results in slower wage growth, decreased employment, lower business revenue, and lower business investment. Recessions occur for a number of reasons, but as seen during the most recent recession from 2007 to 2009, they can result in serious negative consequences for both individuals and businesses. However, the government can replace some of the lost aggregate demand and limit the negative impacts of a recession on individuals and businesses with the use of fiscal stimulus by increasing government spending, decreasing tax revenue, or a combination of the two. Government spending takes the form of both purchases of goods and services by the government, which directly increase economic activity, and transfers to individuals, which indirectly increase economic activity as individuals spend those funds. Decreased tax revenue via tax cuts indirectly increases aggregate demand in the economy. For example, an individual income tax cut increases the amount of disposable income available to individuals, enabling them to purchase more goods and services. Standard economic theory suggests that in the short term, fiscal stimulus can lessen the negative impacts of a recession or hasten a recovery. However, the ability of fiscal stimulus to boost aggregate demand may be limited due to its interaction with other economic processes, including interest rates and investment, exchange rates and the trade balance, and the rate of inflation. To engage in fiscal stimulus by either increasing spending or decreasing tax revenue, the government must increase the size of its deficit and borrow money to finance that stimulus. This can lead to an increase in interest rates and subsequent decreases in investment and some consumer spending. This rise in interest rates may therefore offset some portion of the increase in economic activity spurred by fiscal stimulus. At any given time, there is a limited supply of loanable funds available for the government and private parties to borrow from—a global pool of savings. If the government begins to borrow a larger portion of this pool of savings, it increases the demand for these funds. As demand for loanable funds increases, without any corresponding increase in the supply of these funds, the price to borrow these funds, also known as interest rates, increases. Rising interest rates generally depress economic activity, as they make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money and invest in their firms. Similarly, individuals tend to decrease so-called interest-sensitive spending—spending on goods and services that require a loan, such as cars, homes, and large appliances—when interest rates are relatively higher. The process through which rising interest rates diminish private-sector spending is often referred to as crowding out . However, the degree to which crowding out occurs is partially dependent on where the economy is within the business cycle, either in a recession or in a healthy expansion. During a recession, crowding out tends to be smaller than during a healthy economic expansion due to already depressed demand for investment and interest-sensitive spending. Because demand for loanable funds is already depressed during a recession, the additional demand created by government borrowing does not increase interest rates as much, and therefore does not crowd out as much private spending as it would during an economic expansion. In addition to fiscal policy, the government can influence the business cycle through the use of monetary policy, which is implemented by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is an independent government agency charged with maintaining stable prices and maximum employment through its monetary policy. The Federal Reserve can influence interest rates throughout the economy by adjusting the federal funds rate, a very short-term interest rate faced by banks. Decreasing interest rates reduces the cost to businesses and individuals of borrowing funds to make new investments and purchases. Conversely, increasing interest rates raises the cost to businesses and individuals of borrowing funds to make new investments and purchases. The Federal Reserve can conduct monetary policy in a complementary nature to fiscal policy, offsetting the rise in interest rates by decreasing the federal funds rate. Alternatively, the Federal Reserve can pursue a policy that offsets stimulus, pushing interest rates up by increasing the federal funds rate. Another potential consequence of government fiscal stimulus is an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar and a subsequent increase in the trade deficit, which mitigates some portion of the rise in economic activity resulting from the fiscal stimulus. As discussed above, fiscal stimulus can cause interest rates to rise. In a global context where interest rates are rising in the United States relative to the rest of the world, demand for investment inside the United States is likely to increase among investors around the world as they seek out higher rates of return. The greater demand for investment in the United States is likely to temper the increase in interest rates resulting from fiscal stimulus. However, foreign investors must first exchange their own currency for U.S. dollars to invest in the United States. The increased demand for U.S. dollars increases the value of a U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. As the U.S. dollar appreciates in value, domestic demand for imported goods increases because a U.S. dollar can now buy more goods and services abroad, but foreign demand for U.S. goods and services decreases because they are now relatively more expensive for foreigners. The end result is generally an increase in the U.S. trade deficit, as exports decrease and imports from abroad increase in the United States. An increasing trade deficit, all else equal, means that consumption and production of domestic goods and services are falling, partly offsetting the increase in aggregate demand caused by the stimulus. As discussed above, however, during a recession interest rates are less likely to rise, or are likely to increase to a lesser degree, due to an already depressed demand for investment and spending within the economy. Without rising interest rates, or if they increase to a lesser degree, the associated increase in the trade deficit is also likely to be smaller. In addition, if the Federal Reserve engages in similarly stimulative monetary policy, it may be able to mitigate some of the anticipated increase in the trade deficit by further preventing an increase in interest rates. As discussed above, the goal of fiscal stimulus is to increase aggregate demand within the economy. However, if fiscal stimulus is applied too aggressively, or is implemented when the economy is already operating near full capacity, it can result in an unsustainably large demand for goods and services that the economy is unable to supply. When the demand for goods and services is greater than the available supply, prices tend to rise, a scenario known as inflation. A rising inflation rate can introduce distortions into the economy and impose unnecessary costs on individuals and businesses, although economists generally view low and stable inflation as a sign of a well-managed economy. As such, rising inflation rates can hinder the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus on economic activity by imposing additional costs on individuals and interfering with the efficient allocation of resources in the economy. The Federal Reserve has some ability to limit inflation by implementing contractionary monetary policy. If the Federal Reserve observes accelerating inflation as a result of additional fiscal stimulus, it can counteract this by increasing interest rates. The rise in interest rates results in a slowing of economic activity, neutralizing the fiscal stimulus, and may help to slow inflation as well. Economists attempt to evaluate the overall impact of fiscal stimulus on the economy by estimating fiscal multipliers , which measure the ratio of a change in economic output to the change in government spending or revenue that causes the change in output. A fiscal multiplier greater than one suggests that for each dollar the government spends, the economy grows by more than one dollar. A multiplier may be larger than one if the initial government stimulus results in further spending by private actors. For example, if the government increases spending on infrastructure projects as part of its stimulus, directly increasing aggregate demand, numerous contractors and construction workers will likely receive additional income as a consequence. If those workers then spend a portion of their new income within the economy, it further increases aggregate demand. Alternatively, a fiscal multiplier of less than one suggests that for each dollar the government spends, the economy grows by less than one dollar, suggesting the expansionary power of the fiscal stimulus is being offset by the contractionary pressures discussed above. Estimates of fiscal multipliers vary depending on the form of the fiscal stimulus and on which economic model the economist uses to measure the multiplier. For example, a 2012 academic research article estimated fiscal multipliers for various forms of stimulus utilizing several different prominent economic models from the Federal Reserve Board, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Bank of Canada, and two models developed by academic economists. The authors found varying estimates (see Table 1 ) for different forms of fiscal stimulus ranging from 1.59 for cash transfers to low-income individuals to 0.23 for reduced labor income taxes. Based on these estimates, increasing government spending on consumption by 1% of GDP would result in a 1.55% increase in GDP, and decreasing labor income taxes by 1% of GDP would result in a 0.23% increase in GDP. The magnitude of fiscal multipliers likely depends on where the economy is in the business cycle. As discussed above, during a recession fiscal stimulus is less likely to result in offsetting contractionary effects—such as rising interest rates, trade deficits, and inflation—resulting in a larger increase in economic activity from fiscal stimulus. Accordingly, another academic research article attempted to estimate fiscal multipliers depending on whether the economy was in an expansion or a recession, and found that the multiplier for government spending was between 0 and 0.5 during expansions and between 1.0 and 1.5 during recessions. Persistently applying fiscal stimulus can negatively affect the economy through three main avenues. First, persistent large budget deficits can result in a rising debt-to-GDP ratio and lead to an unsustainable level of debt. Second, persistent fiscal stimulus—particularly during economic expansions—can limit long-term economic growth by crowding out private investment. Third, rising public debt will require a growing portion of the federal budget to be directed toward interest payments on the debt, potentially crowding out other, more worthwhile sources of government spending. Some economic research has suggested that relatively high public debt negatively impacts economic growth. For example, one academic research paper suggested that for developed countries, a 10-percentage-point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with a 0.15- to 0.20-percentage-point decrease in per capita real GDP growth. As noted, persistent fiscal stimulus can result in a rising debt-to-GDP ratio and lead to an unsustainable level of public debt. A rising debt-to-GDP ratio can be problematic if the perceived or real risk of the government defaulting on that debt begins to rise. As the perceived risk of default begins to increase, investors will demand higher interest rates to compensate themselves. The tipping point at which public debt becomes unsustainable is difficult to predict. A continually rising debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to lead to an unsustainable level of debt over time. The threshold at which a nation's debt becomes unsustainable depends on a number of factors, such as the denomination of the debt, political circumstances, and, potentially most importantly, underlying economic conditions. A change in these circumstances may shift a nation's debt to unsustainable without the underlying amount of debt changing at all. To date, it does not appear that the United States has an immediate concern with respect to unsustainability; however, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continually rise under current policy. Persistent fiscal stimulus, and the associated budget deficits, can decrease the size of the economy in the long term as a result of decreased investment in physical capital. As discussed previously, the government's deficit spending can result in higher interest rates, which generally lead to lower levels of business investment. Business investment—spending on physical capital such as factories, computers, software, and machines—is an important determinant of the long-term size of the economy. Physical capital investment allows businesses to produce more goods and services with the same amount of labor and raw materials. As such, government deficits that lead to lower levels of business investment can result in lower quantities of physical capital, and therefore may reduce the productive capacity of the economy in the long term. As discussed earlier, some of the increase in interest rates and decline in domestic investment resulting from fiscal stimulus will likely be offset by additional investment in the United States from abroad. The inflow of capital from abroad is beneficial, as it allows for additional investment in the United States economy. However, in exchange for these investment flows, the United States is now sending a portion of its national income to foreigners in the form of interest payments. With a larger portion of investment flows coming from abroad, rather than from within the United States, a larger portion of the U.S. national income will be sent abroad. Rising public debt may also be of concern due to its associated interest payments. All else equal, an increase in the level of public debt will result in an increase in interest payments that the government must make each year. Rising interest payments may displace government spending on more worthwhile programs. In 2019, interest payments on the debt are projected to be about 1.8% of GDP, or about $382 billion. By 2029 interest payments on the debt are expected to increase significantly, rising to about 3.0% of GDP or about $921 billion. As the economy shifts from a recession and into an expansion, broader economic conditions will generally improve, whereby unemployment falls and wages and private spending increase. With improving economic conditions, policymakers may choose to begin withdrawing fiscal stimulus by decreasing the size of the deficit or potentially by applying contractionary fiscal policy and running a budget surplus. As discussed in the previous section, policymakers may choose to withdraw fiscal stimulus for a number of reasons. First, persistent fiscal stimulus when the economy is near full capacity can exacerbate the negative consequences of fiscal stimulus, such as decreasing investment, rising trade deficits, and accelerating inflation. Second, decreasing the size of the budget deficit slows the accumulation of public debt. The government can withdraw fiscal stimulus by increasing taxes, decreasing spending, or a combination of the two. When the government raises individual income taxes, for example, individuals have less disposable income and decrease their spending on goods and services in response. The decrease in spending reduces aggregate demand for goods and services, slowing economic growth temporarily. Alternatively, when the government reduces spending, it reduces aggregate demand in the economy, which again temporarily slows economic growth. As such, when the government reduces the deficit, regardless of the mix of fiscal policy choices used to do so, aggregate demand is expected to decrease in the near term. However, withdrawing fiscal stimulus is expected to result in lower interest rates and more investment; a depreciation of the U.S. dollar and a shrinking trade deficit; and a slowing inflation rate. These effects tend to spur additional economic activity, partly offsetting the decline resulting from withdrawing fiscal stimulus. Whether the decrease in aggregate demand is problematic for overall economic performance depends on the state of the overall economy at that time. Withdrawing fiscal stimulus is likely to put downward pressure on domestic interest rates, which encourages additional spending and investment, increasing economic activity. When the government decreases its budget deficit, the demand for loanable funds decreases because the government reduces the amount of those funds it is borrowing. The decrease in demand for loanable funds decreases the price to borrow those funds (i.e., interest rates decline). Declining interest rates encourage increased business investment into new capital projects and consumer spending into durable goods by reducing the cost of borrowing. Withdrawing fiscal stimulus is also expected to result in a depreciation of the U.S. dollar and an improved trade balance with the rest of the world. Assuming the shrinking deficit causes a decline in U.S. interest rates relative to interest rates abroad, individuals in the United States and abroad would rather make investments outside of the United States to benefit from those higher interest rates. Individuals shifting their investments outside the United States must first exchange their U.S. dollars for foreign currency, which decreases the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. As the U.S. dollar depreciates, foreign goods and services become relatively more expensive for U.S. residents and U.S. goods and services become relatively less expensive for foreign individuals. This generally results in an improved trade balance as foreign demand for U.S. goods and services (exports) increases and domestic demand for foreign goods and services (imports) decreases. When fiscal stimulus is withdrawn, aggregate demand for goods and services in the economy also tends to shrink, which is expected to slow inflation. Economists generally view relatively low and stable inflation as beneficial for economic growth, because businesses and consumers are relatively certain about the future price of goods and can make efficient decisions with respect to investment and consumption over time. The ultimate impact on the economy of withdrawing fiscal stimulus depends on the relative magnitude of its effects on aggregate demand, interest rates and investment, exchange rates and the trade deficit, and inflation. The same fiscal multipliers discussed earlier in the \" Fiscal Expansion Multiplier \" section can be used to estimate the impact of withdrawing fiscal stimulus by simply reversing the sign for each multiplier. As shown in Table 1 , decreasing government spending on consumption by 1% of GDP is expected to reduce real GDP by 1.55% after the first year, compared to no change in fiscal policy. Alternatively, increasing labor income taxes by 1% of GDP is expected to reduce real GDP by 0.23% after the first year. Again, monetary policy can be used alongside fiscal policy to affect the overall impact on the economy. For example, the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates to spur aggregate demand as the federal government withdraws fiscal stimulus in an effort to offset the decline in aggregate demand resulting from the shrinking deficit. This could allow the government to withdraw fiscal stimulus without decreasing aggregate demand or economic activity. As shown in Figure 1 , the federal government has generally been running a budget deficit for much of the past 30 years—save for two short periods in the 1960s and 1990s. This suggests that the federal government has been applying some level of fiscal stimulus to the economy for much of the past three decades, although the level of stimulus has increased and decreased over time. However, simply examining the overall budget deficit to judge the level of fiscal stimulus can be misleading, as the levels of federal spending and revenue differ over time automatically due to changes in the state of the economy, rather than deliberate choices made each year by Congress. During economic expansions, tax revenue tends to increase and spending tends to decrease automatically, as rising incomes and employment result in higher average incomes and therefore greater individual and corporate income tax revenues. Federal spending on income support programs, such as food stamps and unemployment insurance, tends to fall as fewer people need financial assistance and unemployment claims fall during economic expansions. The combination of rising tax revenue and falling federal spending tends to improve the government's budget deficit. The opposite is true during recessions, when federal spending rises and revenue shrinks. These cyclical fluctuations in revenue and spending are often referred to as automatic stabilizers. Therefore, when examining fiscal policy, it is often beneficial to estimate the budget deficit excluding these automatic stabilizers, referred to as the structural deficit , to get a sense of the affirmative fiscal policy decisions made each year by Congress. As shown in Figure 1 , budget deficits tend to increase during and shortly after recessions (denoted by grey bars) as policymakers attempt to buoy the economy by applying fiscal stimulus. This can be seen explicitly by viewing the structural deficit/surplus, as this only shows affirmative changes in fiscal policy made by Congress. The budget deficit then tends to shrink as the economy enters into recovery and fiscal stimulus is less necessary to support economic growth. However, in recent years, the federal budget has bucked this trend. After the structural deficit peaked in 2009 at roughly 7.5% of GDP, it began to decline through 2014, falling to about 2.0% of GDP. Beginning in 2016, in spite of relatively strong economic conditions, the structural deficit has started to rise again, nearing 4.0% of GDP in 2018. Given that the economy is arguably at or exceeding full employment currently, the increase in fiscal stimulus since 2016 is notable. As discussed earlier, expanding fiscal stimulus when the economy is not depressed can result in rising interest rates, a growing trade deficit, and higher inflation. As of publication of this report, interest rates and inflation do not appear to have been affected by the additional fiscal stimulus; interest rates are at historic lows and inflation shows no signs of acceleration. The trade deficit has been growing in recent years; however, it is not clear that this growth in the trade deficit is a result of increased fiscal stimulus. ", "answers": ["Fiscal policy is the means by which the government adjusts its spending and revenue to influence the broader economy. By adjusting its level of spending and tax revenue, the government can affect the economy by either increasing or decreasing economic activity in the short term. For example, when the government runs a budget deficit, it is said to be engaging in fiscal stimulus, spurring economic activity, and when the government runs a budget surplus, it is said to be engaging in a fiscal contraction, slowing economic activity. The government can use fiscal stimulus to spur economic activity by increasing government spending, decreasing tax revenue, or a combination of the two. Increasing government spending tends to encourage economic activity either directly through purchasing additional goods and services from the private sector or indirectly by transferring funds to individuals who may then spend that money. Decreasing tax revenue tends to encourage economic activity indirectly by increasing individuals' disposable income, which tends to lead to those individuals consuming more goods and services. This sort of expansionary fiscal policy can be beneficial when the economy is in recession, as it lessens the negative impacts of a recession, such as elevated unemployment and stagnant wages. However, expansionary fiscal policy can result in rising interest rates, growing trade deficits, and accelerating inflation, particularly if applied during healthy economic expansions. These side effects from expansionary fiscal policy tend to partly offset its stimulative effects. The government can use contractionary fiscal policy to slow economic activity by decreasing government spending, increasing tax revenue, or a combination of the two. Decreasing government spending tends to slow economic activity as the government purchases fewer goods and services from the private sector. Increasing tax revenue tends to slow economic activity by decreasing individuals' disposable income, likely causing them to decrease spending on goods and services. As the economy exits a recession and begins to grow at a healthy pace, policymakers may choose to reduce fiscal stimulus to avoid some of the negative consequences of expansionary fiscal policy, such as rising interest rates, growing trade deficits, and accelerating inflation, or to manage the level of public debt. In recent history, the federal government has generally followed a pattern of increasing fiscal stimulus during a recession, then decreasing fiscal stimulus during the economic recovery. Prior to the \"Great Recession\" of 2007-2009 the federal budget deficit was about 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007. During the recession, the budget deficit grew to nearly 10% of GDP in part due to additional fiscal stimulus applied to the economy. The budget deficit began shrinking in 2010, falling to about 2% of GDP by 2015. In contrast to the typical pattern of fiscal policy, the budget deficit began growing again in 2016, rising to nearly 4% of GDP in 2018 despite relatively strong economic conditions. This change in fiscal policy is notable, as expanding fiscal stimulus when the economy is not depressed can result in rising interest rates, a growing trade deficit, and accelerating inflation. As of publication of this report, interest rates have not risen discernibly and are still near historic lows, and inflation rates show no sign of acceleration. The trade deficit has been growing in recent years; however, it is not clear that this growth in the trade deficit is a result of increased fiscal stimulus."], "length": 4452, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "117a2b9d8c8e3acae1f98ece49be831311df2909531472f7"}
{"input": "", "context": "In fiscal year 2016, Medicaid covered an estimated 72.2 million low- income and medically needy individuals in the United States, and Medicaid estimated expenditures totaled over $575.9 billion. The federal government matches most state expenditures for Medicaid services on the basis of a statutory formula. States receive higher federal matching rates for certain services or populations, including an enhanced matching rate for Medicaid expenditures for individuals who became eligible for Medicaid under PPACA. Of the $575.9 billion in estimated expenditures for 2016, the federal share totaled over $363.4 billion and the states’ share totaled $212.5 billion. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)—a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—and states jointly administer and fund the Medicaid program. States have flexibility within broad federal requirements to design and implement their Medicaid programs. States must submit a state Medicaid plan to CMS for review and approval. A state’s approved Medicaid plan outlines the services provided and the groups of individuals covered. While states must cover certain mandatory populations and benefits, they have the option of covering other categories of individuals and benefits. PPACA permitted states to expand coverage to a new population—non- elderly, non-pregnant adults who are not eligible for Medicare and whose income does not exceed 138 percent of the FPL. This expansion population comprised 20 percent of total Medicaid enrollment in 2017. (See fig. 1.) As of December 2017, 31 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid eligibility to the new coverage population allowed under PPACA and 19 states had not. Figure 2, an interactive map, illustrates states’ Medicaid expansion status. See appendix II for additional information on figure 2. According to the NHIS estimates, 5.6 million low-income adults were uninsured in 2016. Of these 5.6 million, an estimated 1.9 million uninsured, low-income adults resided in expansion states, compared with an estimated 3.7 million in non-expansion states. Estimates of uninsured, low-income adults comprised less than 1 percent of the total population for all expansion states and 3 percent of the total population for all non- expansion states. NHIS estimates also showed that over half of uninsured, low-income adults were male, over half were employed, and over half had incomes less than 100 percent FPL. For some demographic characteristics, there were some statistically significant differences between uninsured, low- income adults in expansion states compared with these adults in non- expansion states. For example, expansion states had significantly larger percentages of uninsured, low-income males than non-expansion states. (See table 1.) See table 6 in appendix III for additional demographic characteristics of uninsured, low-income adults. Estimates from the 2016 NHIS showed some statistically significant differences in the health status of uninsured, low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. In particular, expansion states had a larger percentage of these adults who reported that their health was “good” and a smaller percentage who reported their health as “fair or poor” than those in non-expansion states. However, the percentages of uninsured, low-income adults with responses of “excellent or very good” in both expansion and non-expansion states were large—47 percent or larger, and the differences between the two groups of states were not statistically significant. (See fig. 3.) See table 7 in appendix III for additional information about the health status for uninsured, low-income adults. The 2016 NHIS estimates showed that smaller percentages of low- income adults in expansion states reported having any unmet medical needs compared with those in non-expansion states; and smaller percentages of those who were insured reported having any unmet medical needs compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived, for example: Low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Access to Health Care: Measuring Any Unmet Medical Needs The National Center for Health Statistics, the federal agency that conducts the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), developed a composite measure on any unmet medical needs, which was based on six survey questions on respondents’ ability to afford different types of needed health care services. These questions asked whether in the past 12 months respondents could not afford medical care at any time; delayed seeking medical care due to worries about costs; or could not afford needed prescription drugs, mental health or counseling, dental care, or eyeglasses. percent or less of the low-income adults who had Medicaid or private health insurance in expansion or non-expansion states reported having any unmet medical needs, compared with 50 percent or more of those who were uninsured in expansion or non-expansion states. Further, among the uninsured, 50 percent of low-income adults living in expansion states reported any unmet medical needs, compared with 63 percent of those in non-expansion states. (See fig. 4.) See tables 8 and 9 in appendix IV for estimates of the composite measure we reviewed on any unmet medical needs. The 2016 NHIS estimates showed that smaller percentages of low- income adults in expansion states reported financial barriers to needed health care compared with those in non-expansion states; and smaller percentages of those who were insured reported financial barriers to needed health care compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived, for example: Low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Nine percent of low-income adults in expansion states reported that they could not afford needed medical care, compared with 20 percent of low-income adults in non-expansion states. Low-income adults who were insured and uninsured. Twelve percent or less of low-income adults who had Medicaid or private health insurance in expansion or non-expansion states reported financial barriers to needed medical care, compared with 27 percent or more of those who were uninsured in expansion or non-expansion states. In addition, among low- income adults who were uninsured, a smaller percentage of those who lived in expansion states reported financial barriers to two of the six needed health care services compared with those who lived in non-expansion states. (See fig. 5.) See tables 10 through 13 in appendix V for estimates of all survey questions we reviewed on financial barriers to health care. The 2016 NHIS also collected information on non-financial barriers to health care. Specifically, the survey asked whether respondents had delayed health care due to non-financial reasons, such as they lacked transportation, were unable to get through on the phone, were unable to get a timely appointment, experienced long wait time at the doctor’s office, or were not able to get to a clinic or doctor’s office when it was open. The 2016 NHIS showed that the same or similar percentages of low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states reported delaying care due to a lack of transportation or other non-financial reasons. Further, generally similar or larger percentages of low-income adults with insurance reported delaying care due to non-financial reasons, compared with those who were uninsured. See tables 14 and 15 in appendix V for estimates of low-income adults in expansion and non- expansion states and by insurance status on non-financial barriers to health care. The 2016 NHIS estimates showed that a larger percentage of low-income adults in expansion states reported having a usual place of care compared with those in non-expansion states; and larger percentages of those who were insured reported having a usual place of care compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived, for example: Low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Eighty-two percent of the low-income adults in expansion states reported having a usual place of care when they were sick or needed advice about their health, compared with 68 percent of those in non- expansion states. Access to Health Care: Having a Usual Place of Care The 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) asked respondents about whether they had a place they usually go when sick or need advice about their health. Low-income adults who were insured and uninsured. Seventy- eight percent or more of those who had Medicaid or private health insurance in expansion or non-expansion states reported having a usual place of care, compared with 46 percent or less of those who were uninsured in expansion or non-expansion states. Among the uninsured, similar percentages of low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states reported having a usual place of care. (See fig. 6.) See tables 16 through 19 in appendix VI for estimates of all survey questions we reviewed on having a usual place of care. The 2016 estimates showed that larger percentages of low-income adults in expansion states reported receiving selected health care services, such as a flu vaccine, compared with those in non-expansion states; and larger percentages of those with insurance reported receiving selected health care services compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived, for example: Low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Thirty-one percent of low-income adults in expansion states reported receiving flu vaccinations, compared with 24 percent of those in non- expansion states. having their blood cholesterol checked by having their blood pressure checked by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional; visiting a hospital emergency department. percent or more of low-income adults who had Medicaid or private health insurance in expansion or non-expansion states reported receiving blood cholesterol checks, compared with 28 percent or less of low-income adults who were uninsured in expansion or non- expansion states. Among the uninsured, generally similar percentages of low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states reported blood cholesterol checks, flu vaccines, and other selected services. (See fig. 7.) See tables 20 and 21 in appendix VI for estimates of all survey questions we reviewed on selected health care services. The 2016 NHIS also asked respondents whether they visited or had spoken to a health care professional about their health, including: a general doctor, such as a general practitioner, family doctor, and a nurse practitioner, physician’s assistant, or midwife; and a doctor who specializes in a particular disease, with the exception of obstetricians, gynecologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists.

To describe national survey estimates of (1) the number and demographic characteristics of uninsured, low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states; (2) unmet medical needs for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status; (3) barriers to health care for low-income adults in expansion and non- expansion states and by insurance status; and (4) having a usual place of care and receiving selected health care services for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status, we used data from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The 2016 NHIS were the most recent data available when we conducted our analyses. This appendix describes the data source, study population, analyses conducted, study limitations, and data reliability assessment. The NHIS collects demographic, health status, health insurance, health care access, and health care service use data for the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. It is an annual, nationally representative, cross-sectional household interview survey. NHIS interviews are conducted continuously throughout the year for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that compiles statistical information to help guide health policy decisions. Interviews are conducted in respondents’ homes, and interviewers may conduct follow- up interviews over the telephone to complete an interview. Information about some NHIS respondents, such as information about their health status, may be obtained through an interview with another family member on behalf of the respondent. NHIS data are organized into several data files. Estimates used for our study are based on data with the 2016 Family and Sample Adult Core components of the 2016 NHIS. Sociodemographic, insurance, and select health care access and utilization variables were defined using data collected in the Family Core component of the survey, which includes data on every household member for the families participating in NHIS. Other measures of health care access and utilization examined in this study are based on data collected in the Sample Adult Core component. In this component, the respondent (i.e., the sample adult) is randomly selected from among all adults aged ≥18 years in the family. A proxy respondent might respond for the sample adult if, because of health reasons, the sample adult is physically or mentally unable to respond themselves. The 2016 imputed income files were used to define poverty thresholds, which is based on reported and imputed family income. The NHIS publicly released data files for 2016 include data for 40,220 households containing 97,169 persons, and the total household response rate was 67.9 percent. For this study we asked NCHS to provide estimates of low-income, non- elderly adults, which we defined as individuals ages 19 to 64, with family incomes that did not exceed 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). We also requested that estimates be provided separately for respondents based on whether they resided in an expansion or non- expansion state, and whether they were covered by private health insurance, Medicaid, or had no insurance. We gave NCHS specifications for the definition of low-income, non-elderly adults; the states that should be classified as expansion or non-expansion states in calendar year 2016; and the respondents who should be classified as having private health insurance, Medicaid, or no insurance. We asked NCHS to exclude respondents who were noncitizens, were covered by Medicare, only received health care services through military health care or through the Indian Health Service, or had Supplemental Social Security Income. We also excluded adult females from the Sample Adult file who responded they were pregnant at the time of the interview. In addition, we asked NCHS to exclude individuals for which information was missing—not recorded or not provided during the interview—on health insurance coverage (Medicaid, private health insurance, Indian Health Service, military health care, or no health insurance), receipt of Supplemental Social Security Income, and U.S. citizenship. We classified individuals in our study population as residing in an expansion or non-expansion state based on their state of residence when they were interviewed for the 2016 NHIS. We classified the 30 states and the District of Columbia that expanded their Medicaid eligibility before July 1, 2016, as expansion states. The remaining 20 states were classified as non-expansion states. Louisiana expanded Medicaid coverage on July 1, 2016; therefore, we classified it as a non-expansion state. We decided not to classify Louisiana as an expansion state because we allowed a 6- month period for the effects of expansion to appear. Therefore, for Louisiana we only included NHIS respondents interviewed from January through June 2016 when Louisiana was a non-expansion state. Similarly, for two expansion states—Alaska and Montana—we only included individuals who were interviewed March through December 2016 and July through December 2016, respectively, after the state expanded Medicaid to allow for a 6-month time period for the effect of expansion to take place. (See table 2.) Table 3 below illustrates the sample size and population estimates of low- income sample adults by expansion state, non-expansion state, and national total. We classified NHIS respondents as having private health insurance, Medicaid, or no insurance based on the health insurance classification approach used by NCHS for NHIS. NCHS assigned NHIS respondents’ health insurance classification based on a hierarchy of mutually exclusive categories in the following order: private health insurance, Medicaid, other coverage, and uninsured. Low-income adults with more than one coverage type were assigned to the first appropriate category in the hierarchy. Respondents were classified as having private health insurance if they reported that they were covered by any comprehensive private health insurance plan (including health maintenance and preferred provider organizations). Private coverage excluded plans that pay for one type of service, such as accidents or dental care. Respondents were classified as having Medicaid if they reported they were covered by Medicaid or by a state-sponsored health plan with no premiums or it was not known whether a premium was charged. Respondents were classified as being uninsured if they did not report having any private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, state-sponsored or other government-sponsored health plan, or military health plan. Respondents were also classified as being uninsured if they only had insurance coverage with a private plan that paid for one type of service, such as accidents or dental care. We gave NCHS officials specifications to calculate estimates from the 2016 NHIS for demographic characteristics, access to care, as well as composite measures of access to health care based on selected survey questions. Composite measures are NCHS-developed measures based on responses to NHIS questions covering related topics. The analysis included two composite measures: 1. any unmet medical needs, which is based on responses to six underlying survey questions that asked respondents about whether during the past 12 months they needed medical care but did not get it because they could not afford it; delayed seeking medical care because of worry about the cost; or did not get prescription medicines, mental health care or counseling, eyeglasses, or dental care due to cost; and 2. any non-financial barriers to health care, which is based on five underlying questions that asked respondents whether they delayed care in the past 12 months for any of the following reasons: could not get through on the telephone; could not get an appointment soon enough; waited too long to see the doctor after arriving at the doctor’s office; the clinic/doctor’s office was not open when respondent could get there; and did not have transportation. NCHS officials calculated our requested estimates of groups within our study population based on whether respondents resided in an expansion or non-expansion state and whether they had private health insurance, Medicaid, or were uninsured at the time of the interview. For each comparison—such as comparisons of access to health care for respondents in expansion versus non-expansion states—we asked NCHS to test for statistically significant differences. We identified a statistically significant difference when the p-value from a t-test of the difference in the estimated proportions between two study subgroups had a value of less than 0.05. To describe the number and demographic characteristics of uninsured, low-income adults, we compared estimates of selected demographic characteristics (race and ethnicity, gender, poverty status, and employment status) and reported health status for this group in expansion and non-expansion states. These and other estimates of demographic characteristics and reported health status from the 2016 NHIS for uninsured, low-income adults by expansion states, non-expansion states, and all states are provided in tables 6 and 7 in appendix III. To describe unmet medical needs, barriers to health care, and having a usual place of care and receiving selected services for all low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status, we asked NCHS to calculate estimates based on responses to selected NHIS questions and NCHS composite measures. We selected these survey questions and composite measures from the Family and Adult Access to Health Care and Utilization and Adult Health Behaviors sections of the 2016 NHIS. To summarize estimates of low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status, responses to selected survey questions and composite measures were calculated as an estimated percentage of the relevant group’s total population for eight groups of low-income adults: (1) those in expansion states, (2) those in non-expansion states, (3) those who had Medicaid in expansion states, (4) those who had Medicaid in non-expansion states, (5) those who had private health insurance in expansion states, (6) those who had private health insurance in non-expansion states, (7) those who were uninsured in expansion states, and (8) those who were uninsured in non-expansion states. We asked NCHS to test for statistically significant differences for the estimates of access to care between selected groups of low-income adults. (See table 4.) The results of the tests for statistically significant differences for these comparison groups are in appendixes IV through VI. Our study has some limitations. First, our study did not examine whether statistically significant differences in estimates of access to health care between respondents in expansion and non-expansion states were associated with the choice to expand Medicaid. Second, NHIS data are based on respondent-reported data, which may be subject to potential biases and recall of participants’ use of health services and may be less accurate than administrative data or clinical data. Third, we could not report estimates of access to health care that did not meet NCHS’s standards of reliability or precision. We assessed the reliability of NHIS data by reviewing NHIS data documentation; interviewing knowledgeable NCHS officials and academic researchers; and examining the data for logical errors, missing values, and values outside of expected ranges. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of these analyses. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), states may opt to expand their Medicaid programs’ eligibility to cover certain low-income adults beginning January 2014. As of December 2017, 31 states and the District of Columbia had expanded their Medicaid programs as permitted under PPACA and 19 states had not. Table 5 lists the states that expanded Medicaid eligibility and those that did not. It also includes state population and other Medicaid data, which is presented in the roll-over information in interactive figure 2. This appendix provides additional 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates we obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Table 6 presents estimates of selected demographic characteristics for low-income adults who were uninsured at the time of the survey interview. The table provides estimates for these adults based on whether they resided in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility as permitted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) (referred to as expansion states) or states that did not (referred to as non- expansion states). We report statistically significant differences when comparing the responses of uninsured, low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Table 7 shows estimates of the reported health status of uninsured, low- income adults based on whether they resided in an expansion or non- expansion state. The table provides the number and percent of these adults who reported that at the time of the interview their health status was excellent or very good; good; or fair or poor. The table also shows the extent to which these adults reported whether their health status was different at the time of the interview compared to the previous year. We report statistically significant differences when comparing the responses of uninsured, low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. This appendix provides estimates of any unmet medical needs for low- income adults—individuals ages 19 to 64, with family incomes that did not exceed 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL)—from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which were produced by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Estimates are based on a composite measure of any unmet medical needs. Table 8 shows estimates of all low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. We also report statistically significant differences between low- income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Table 9 shows estimates of six groups of low-income adults: (1) low- income adults who were uninsured in expansion states; (2) low-income adults who were uninsured in non-expansion states; (3) low-income adults who had Medicaid in expansion states; (4) low-income adults who had Medicaid in non-expansion states; (5) low-income adults who had private health insurance in expansion states; and (6) low-income adults who had private health insurance in non-expansion states. We also report any statistically significant differences when comparing the six groups of low-income adults, specifically: low-income adults who were uninsured in expansion states compared with each of the four groups of low-income adults who were insured— low-income adults who had Medicaid in expansion states, low-income adults who had Medicaid in non-expansion states, low-income adults who had private health insurance in expansion states, and low-income adults who had private insurance in non-expansion states; low-income adults who were uninsured in non-expansion states compared with each of the four groups of low-income adults who were insured; low-income adults who were uninsured in expansion states compared with low-income adults who were uninsured in non-expansion states; low-income adults who had Medicaid in expansion states compared with low-income adults who had Medicaid in non-expansion states; and low-income adults who had private health insurance in expansion states compared with low-income adults who had private health insurance in non-expansion states. This appendix provides estimates of barriers to health care for low- income adults—individuals ages 19 to 64, with family incomes that did not exceed 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL)—from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which we obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Estimates of financial barriers to needed medical, specialty, and other types of health care and prescription drugs are based on selected survey questions. Estimates of non-financial barriers to health care are based on responses to selected survey questions and a composite measure. Estimates are reported for: All low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. We also report statistically significant differences between low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Six groups of low-income adults: (1) low-income adults who were uninsured in expansion states; (2) low-income adults who were uninsured in non-expansion states; (3) low-income adults who had Medicaid in expansion states; (4) low-income adults who had Medicaid in non-expansion states; (5) low-income adults who had private health insurance in expansion states; and (6) low-income adults who had private health insurance in non-expansion states.

Financial barriers to medical, specialty, and other types of health care. Tables 10 and 11 present estimates and differences in estimates of responses to survey question that asked whether respondents did not obtain different types of needed health care services in the past 12 months because they could not afford it. Financial barriers to prescription drugs. Tables 12 and 13 present estimates and differences in estimates of survey question that asked respondents who had been prescribed medications whether they had taken actions during the past 12 months to save money on medications. Non-financial barriers to health care. Tables 14 and 15 present estimates and differences in estimates of the NCHS composite measure on any non-financial barriers to health care, which was based on responses to five survey questions on whether respondents delayed care in the past 12 months due to long wait times, a lack of transportation, and other non-financial reasons. Additionally, these tables present estimates and differences in estimates of responses to the composite measure’s five underlying survey questions. This appendix provides estimates on having a usual place of care and receiving selected health care services for adults—individuals ages 19 to 64, with family incomes that did not exceed 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL)—from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which we obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Estimates are based on responses to selected survey questions on having a usual place of care, receiving selected health care services, and contacting health care professionals. Estimates are reported for: All low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. We also report statistically significant differences between low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states. Six groups of low-income adults: (1) low-income adults who were uninsured in expansion states; (2) low-income adults who were uninsured in non-expansion states; (3) low-income adults who had Medicaid in expansion states; (4) low-income adults who had Medicaid in non-expansion states; (5) low-income adults who had private health insurance in expansion states; and (6) low-income adults who had private health insurance in non-expansion states.

GAO obtained 2016 NHIS estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that maintains these survey data. NHIS is a household interview survey designed to be a nationally representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized population residing in the United States. Estimates were calculated for demographic characteristics for uninsured, low-income adults. In addition, estimates were calculated for unmet medical needs, barriers to health care, and having a usual place of care and receiving selected health services for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status The estimates were based on responses to selected survey questions. GAO selected these survey questions from the Family and Adult Access to Health Care and Utilization and another section of the 2016 NHIS. GAO took steps to assess the reliability of the 2016 NHIS estimates, including interviewing NCHS officials and examining the data for logical errors. GAO determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of its analyses. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. According to the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an estimated 5.6 million uninsured, low-income adults—those ages 19 through 64—had incomes at or below the income threshold for expanded Medicaid eligibility as allowed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Estimates from this nationally representative survey showed that about 1.9 million of the 5.6 million uninsured, low-income adults lived in states that chose to expand Medicaid under PPACA, while the remaining 3.7 million lived in non-expansion states—those that did not choose to expand Medicaid. In 2016, over half of uninsured, low-income adults were male, over half were employed, and over half had incomes less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level in both expansion and non-expansion states. The 2016 NHIS estimates showed that low-income adults in expansion states were less likely to report having any unmet medical needs compared with those in non-expansion states, and low-income adults who were insured were less likely to report having unmet medical needs compared with those who were uninsured. Among the low-income adults who were uninsured, those in expansion states were less likely to report having any unmet medical needs compared with those in non-expansion states. The 2016 NHIS estimates also showed that low-income adults in expansion states were less likely to report financial barriers to needed medical care and other types of health care, such as specialty care, compared with those in non-expansion states, and low-income adults who were insured were less likely to report financial barriers to needed medical care compared with those who were uninsured. Among low-income adults who were uninsured, those in expansion states were less likely to report financial barriers to needed medical care compared with those in non-expansion states. Finally, the 2016 NHIS estimates showed that low-income adults in expansion states were more likely to report having a usual place of care to go when sick or needing advice about their health and receiving selected health care services compared with those in non-expansion states. The estimates also showed that low-income adults who were insured were generally more likely to report having a usual place of care and receiving selected health care services compared with those who were uninsured. Among the uninsured, relatively similar percentages of low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states reported having a usual place of care. Similarly, estimates showed that relatively similar percentages of low-income adults who were uninsured in expansion and non-expansion states reported receiving selected health care services, such as receiving a flu vaccine or a blood pressure check."], "length": 5949, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d5e09c7a5155d25dc6320e9dd1a5b62766cc3ebd2a5e38b2"}
{"input": "", "context": "Some time ago, a federal prosecutor referred to the mail and wire fraud statutes as \"our Stradivarius, our Colt 45, our Louisville Slugger … and our true love.\" Not everyone shared the prosecutor's delight. Commentators have argued that the statutes \"have long provided prosecutors with a means by which to salvage a modest, but dubious, victory from investigations that essentially proved unfruitful.\" Federal judges have also expressed concern from time to time, observing that the \"mail and wire fraud statutes have 'been invoked to impose criminal penalties upon a staggeringly broad swath of behavior,' creating uncertainty in business negotiations and challenges to due process and federalism.\" Nevertheless, mail and wire fraud prosecutions have brought to an end schemes that bilked victims of millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. The federal mail and wire fraud statutes outlaw schemes to defraud that involve the use of mail or wire communications. Both condemn fraudulent conduct that may also come within the reach of other federal criminal statutes. Both may serve as racketeering and money laundering predicate offenses. Both are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years; for not more than 30 years, if the victim is a financial institution or the offense is committed in the context of major disaster or emergency. Both entitle victims to restitution. Both may result in the forfeiture of property. The first of the two, the mail fraud statute, emerged in the late 19 th century as a means of preventing \"city slickers\" from using the mail to cheat guileless \"country folks.\" But for penalty increases and amendments calculated to confirm its breadth, the prohibition has come down to us essentially unchanged. Speaking in 1987, the Supreme Court noted that \"the last substantive amendment to the statute ... was the codification of the holding of Durland ... in 1909.\" Congress did amend it thereafter to confirm that the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud statute reached schemes to defraud another of the right to honest services and to encompass the use of commercial postal carriers. The wire fraud statute is of more recent vintage. Enacted as part of the Communications Act Amendments of 1952, it was always intended to mirror the provisions of the mail fraud statute. Since its inception, changes in the mail fraud statute have come with corresponding changes in the wire fraud statute in most instances. The mail and wire fraud statutes are essentially the same, except for the medium associated with the offense—the mail in the case of mail fraud and wire communication in the case of wire fraud. As a consequence, the interpretation of one is ordinarily considered to apply to the other. In construction of the terms within the two, the courts will frequently abbreviate or adjust their statement of the elements of a violation to focus on the questions at issue before them. As treatment of the individual elements makes clear, however, there seems little dispute that conviction requires the government to prove the use of either mail or wire communications in the foreseeable furtherance of a scheme and intent to defraud another of either property or honest services involving a material deception. The wire fraud statute applies to anyone who \"transmits or causes to be transmitted by wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce any writings ... for the purpose of executing [a] ... scheme or artifice.\" The mail fraud statute is similarly worded and applies to anyone who \"... for the purpose of executing [a] ... scheme or artifice ... places in any post office ... or causes to be delivered by mail ... any ... matter.\" The statutes require that a mailing or wire communication be in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. The mailing or communication need not be an essential element of the scheme, as long as it \"is incident to an essential element of the scheme.\" A qualifying mailing or communication, standing alone, may be routine, innocent or even self-defeating, because \"[t]he relevant question at all times is whether the mailing is part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time, regardless of whether the mailing later, through hindsight, may prove to have been counterproductive.\" The element may be satisfied by mailings or communications \"designed to lull the victim into a false sense of security, postpone inquiries or complaints, or make the transaction less suspect.\" The element may also be satisfied by mailings or wire communications used to obtain the property which is the object of the fraud. A defendant need not personally have mailed or wired a communication; it is enough that he \"caused\" a mailing or transmission of a wire communication in the sense that the mailing or transmission was the reasonable foreseeable consequence of his intended scheme. The mail and wire fraud statutes \"both prohibit, in pertinent part, 'any scheme or artifice to defraud[,]' or to obtain money or property 'by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,\" or deprive another of the right to honest services by such means. From the beginning, Congress intended to reach a wide range of schemes to defraud, and has expanded the concept whenever doubts arose. It added the second prong—obtaining money or property by false pretenses, representations, or promises—after defendants had suggested that the term \"scheme to defraud\" covered false pretenses concerning present conditions but not representations or promises of future conditions. More recently, it added 18 U.S.C. § 1346 to make it clear the term \"scheme to defraud\" encompassed schemes to defraud another of the right to honest services. Even before that adornment, the words were understood to \"refer 'to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes,' and 'usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.'\" As a general rule, the crime is done when the scheme is hatched and an attendant mailing or interstate phone call or email has occurred. Thus, the statutes are said to condemn a scheme to defraud regardless of its success. It is not uncommon for the courts to declare that to demonstrate a scheme to defraud the government needs to show that the defendant's \"communications were reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.\" Even a casual reading, however, might suggest that the statutes also cover a scheme specifically designed to deceive a naïve victim. Nevertheless, the courts have long acknowledged the possibility of a \"puffing\" defense, and there may be some question whether the statutes reach those schemes designed to deceive the gullible though they could not ensnare the reasonably prudent. In any event, the question may be more clearly presented in the context of the defendant's intent and the materiality of the deception. The mail and wire fraud statutes speak of schemes to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses. The Supreme Court has said that the phrase \"to defraud\" and the phrase \"to obtain money or property\" do not represent separate crimes, but instead the phrase \"obtain money or property\" describes what constitutes a scheme to defraud. In later look-alike offenses, Congress specifically numerated the two phrases. The bank fraud statute, for example, applies to \"whoever knowingly executes … a scheme or artifice — (1) to defraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain any of the money, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by … a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses …\" It left the mail and wire fraud statutes, however, unchanged. The mail and wire fraud statutes clearly protect against deprivations of tangible property. They also protect certain intangible property rights, but only those that have value in the hands of the victim of a scheme. \"To determine whether a particular interest is property for purposes of the fraud statutes, [courts] look to whether the law traditionally has recognized and enforced it as a property right.\" Neither the mail nor the wire fraud statute exhibits an explicit reference to materiality. Yet materiality is an element of each offense, because at the time of the statutes' enactment, the word \"defraud\" was understood to \"require[] a misrepresentation or concealment of [a] material fact.\" Thus, other than in an honest services context, a \"scheme to defraud\" for mail or wire fraud purposes must involve a material misrepresentation of some kind. \"A misrepresentation is material if it is capable of influencing the intended victim.\" Again, other than in the case of honest services, \"'intent to defraud' requires an intent to (1) deceive, and (2) cause some harm to result from the deceit. A defendant acts with the intent to deceive when he acts knowingly with the specific intent to deceive for the purpose of causing pecuniary loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to himself.\" A defendant has a complete defense if he believes the deceptive statements or promises to be true or otherwise acts under circumstances that belie an intent to defraud. Yet, a defendant has no defense if he blinds himself to the truth. Nor is it a defense if he intends to deceive but feels his victim will ultimately profit or be unharmed. The Supreme Court held in McNally v. United States that the protection of the mail fraud statute, and by implication the protection of the wire fraud statute, did not extend to \"the intangible right of the citizenry to good government.\" Soon after McNally , Congress enlarged the mail and wire fraud protection to include the intangible right to honest services, by defining the \"term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' [to] include[s] a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right to honest services.\" Lest the expanded definition be found unconstitutionally vague, the Court in Skilling v. United States limited its application to cases of bribery or kickbacks. The Court in Skilling supplied only a general description of the bribery and kickbacks condemned in the honest-services statute. Subsequent lower federal courts have often looked to the general federal law relating to bribery and kickbacks for the substantive elements of honest services bribery. In this context, bribery requires \"a quid pro quo—a specific intent to give … something of value in exchange for an official act.\" And an \"official act\" means no more than an officer's formal exercise of governmental power in the form of a \"decision or action on a 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy'\" before him. The definition of the word \"kickback\" quoted by the Court in Skilling has since been reassigned, and the courts have cited the dictionary definition on occasion. Except for the elements of a scheme to defraud in the form of a bribe and a kickback, honest services fraud, as an adjunct of the mail and wire fraud statutes, draws its elements and the sanctions that attend the offense from the mail and wire fraud statutes. Attempting or conspiring to commit mail or wire fraud or aiding and abetting the commission of those offenses carries the same penalties as the underlying offense. \"In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\" \"Conspiracy to commit wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1349 requires a jury to find that (1) two or more persons agreed to commit wire fraud and (2) the defendant willfully joined the conspiracy with the intent to further its unlawful purpose.\" As a general rule, a conspirator is liable for any other offenses that a co-conspirator commits in the foreseeable furtherance of the conspiracy. Such liability, however, extends only until the objectives of the conspiracy have been accomplished or the defendant has withdrawn from the conspiracy. Where attempt has been made a separate offense, as it has for mail and wire fraud, conviction ordinarily requires that the defendant commit a substantial step toward the completion of the underlying offense with the intent to commit it. It does not, however, require the attempt to have been successful. Unlike conspiracy, a defendant may not be convicted of both the substantive offense and the lesser included crime of attempt to commit it. A mail and wire fraud are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations), or fine of not more than $1 million and imprisonment for not more than 30 years if the victim is a financial institution or the offense was committed in relation to a natural disaster. It is also subject to a mandatory minimum two-year term of imprisonment if identify theft is used during and in furtherance of the fraud. Conviction may also result in probation, a term of supervised release, a special assessment, a restitution order, and/or a forfeiture order. Sentencing in federal court begins with the federal Sentencing Guidelines. The Guidelines are essentially a scorekeeping system. A defendant's ultimate sentence under the Guidelines is determined by reference first to a basic guideline, which sets a base \"offense level.\" Offense levels are then added or subtracted to reflect his prior criminal record as well as the aggravating and mitigating circumstances attending his offense. One of two basic guidelines applies to mail and wire fraud. Section 2C1.1 applies to mail or wire fraud convictions involving corruption of public officials. Section 2B1.1 applies to other mail or wire fraud convictions. Both sections include enhancements based on the amount of loss associated with the fraud. After all the calculations, the final offense level determines the Guidelines' recommendations concerning probation, imprisonment, and fines. The Guidelines convert final offense levels into 43 sentencing groups, which are in turn each divided into six sentencing ranges based on the defendant's criminal history. Thus, for instance, the recommended sentencing range for a first-time offender (i.e., one with a category I criminal history) with a final offense level of 15 is imprisonment for between 18 and 24 months. A defendant with the same offense level 15 but with a criminal record placing him in criminal history category VI, would face imprisonment from between 41 and 51 months. The Guidelines also provide offense-level-determined fine ranges for individuals and organizations. As a general rule, sentencing courts may place a defendant on probation for a term of from 1 to 5 years for any crime punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than 25 years. The Guidelines, however, recommend \"pure\" probation, that is, probation without any term of incarceration, only with respect to defendants with an offense level of 8 or below, i.e., levels where the sentencing range is between zero and six months. Once a court has calculated the Guidelines' recommendations, it must weigh the other statutory factors found in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) before imposing a sentence. Appellate courts will uphold a sentence if the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. A sentence is reasonable procedurally if it is free of procedural defects, such as a failure to accurately calculate the Guidelines' recommendations and to fully explain the reasons for the sentence selected. A sentence is reasonable substantively if it is reasonable in light of circumstances that a case presents. Supervised release is a form of parole-like supervision imposed after a term of imprisonment has been served. Although imposition of a term of supervised release is discretionary in mail and wire fraud cases, the Sentencing Guidelines recommend its imposition in all felony cases. The maximum supervised release term for wire and mail fraud generally is three years—five years when the defendant is convicted of the mail or wire fraud against a financial institution that carries a 30-year maximum term of imprisonment. Release will be subject to a number of conditions, violation of which may result in a return to prison for not more than two years (not more than three years if the original crime of conviction carried a 30-year maximum). There are three mandatory conditions: (1) commit no new crimes; (2) allow a DNA sample to be taken; and (3) submit to periodic drug testing. The court may suspend the drug testing condition, although it is under no obligation to do so even though the defendant has no history of drug abuse and drug abuse played no role in the offense. Most courts will impose a standard series of conditions in addition to the mandatory condition of supervised release. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that these include the payment of any fines, restitution, and special assessments that remain unsatisfied. Defendants convicted of mail or wire fraud must pay a special assessment of $100. Restitution is ordinarily required of those convicted of mail or wire fraud. The victims entitled to restitution include those directly and proximately harmed by the defendant's crime of conviction, and \"in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity,\" like mail and wire fraud, \"any person directly harmed by the defendant's conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\" Property that constitutes the proceeds of mail or wire fraud is subject to confiscation by the United States. It may be confiscated pursuant to either civil forfeiture or criminal forfeiture procedures. Civil forfeiture proceedings are conducted that treat the forfeitable property as the defendant. Criminal forfeiture proceedings are conducted as part of the criminal prosecution of the property owner. The mail and wire fraud statutes essentially outlaw dishonesty. Due to their breadth, misconduct that constitutes mail or wire fraud may constitute a violation of one or more other federal criminal statutes as well. This overlap occurs perhaps most often with respect to (1) crimes for which mail or wire fraud are elements (\"predicate offenses\") of another offense; (2) fraud proscribed under jurisdictional circumstances other than mail or wire use; and (3) honest services fraud in the form of bribery or kickbacks. Some federal crimes have as an element the commission of some other federal offense. The money laundering statute, for example, outlaws laundering the proceeds of various predicate offenses. The racketeering statute outlaws the patterned commission of a series of predicate offenses in order to operate a racketeering enterprise. Mail and wire fraud are racketeering and money laundering predicate offenses. The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) provisions outlaw acquiring or conducting the affairs of an enterprise, engaged in or whose activities affect interstate commerce, through loan sharking or the patterned commission of various other predicate offenses. The racketeering-conduct and conspiracy-to-engage-in-racketeering-conduct appear to be the RICO offenses most often built on wire or mail fraud violations. The elements of the RICO conduct offense are (1) conducting the affairs; (2) of an enterprise; (3) engaged in activities in or that impact interstate or foreign commerce; (4) through a pattern; (5) of racketeering activity. To prove a RICO conspiracy, the government must prove: \"(1) that two or more persons agreed to conduct or to participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity; (2) that the defendant was a party to or a member of that agreement; and (3) that the defendant joined the agreement or conspiracy knowing of its objective to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" \"Racketeering activity\" means, among other things, any act that is indictable under either the mail or wire fraud statutes. As for pattern, a RICO pattern \"requires at least two acts of racketeering activity. The racketeering predicates may establish a pattern if they [were] related and … amounted to, or threatened the likelihood of, continued criminal activity.'\" The pattern of predicate offenses must be used by someone employed by or associated with a qualified enterprise to conduct or participate in its activities. \"Congress did not intend to extend RICO liability . . . beyond those who participated in the operation and management of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" Nevertheless, \"liability under § 1962(c) is not limited to upper management … An enterprise is operated not just by upper management but also by lower rung participants.\" The enterprise may be either any group of individuals, any legal entity, or any group \"associated in fact.\" \"Nevertheless, 'an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise and longevity sufficient to permit those associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.'\" Moreover, qualified enterprises are only those that \"engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\" RICO violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations). The crime is one for which restitution must be ordered when one of the predicate offenses is mail or wire fraud. RICO has one of the first contemporary forfeiture provisions, covering property and interests acquired through RICO violations. As noted earlier, any RICO predicate offense is by virtue of that fact a money laundering predicate. RICO violations create a cause of action for treble damages for the benefit of anyone injured in their business or property by the offense. Mail and wire fraud are both money laundering predicate offenses by virtue of their status as RICO predicates. The most commonly prosecuted federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956, outlaws, among other things, knowingly engaging in a financial transaction involving the proceeds generated by a \"specified unlawful activity\" (a predicate offense) for the purpose (1) of laundering the proceeds (i.e., concealing their source or ownership), or (2) of promoting further predicating offenses. To establish the concealment offense, the government must establish that \"(1) [the] defendant conducted, or attempted to conduct a financial transaction which in any way or degree affected interstate commerce or foreign commerce; (2) the financial transaction involved proceeds of illegal activity; (3) [the] defendant knew the property represented proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, [such as mail or wire fraud]; and (4) [the] defendant conducted or attempted to conduct the financial transaction knowing the transaction was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\" To prove the promotional offense, \"the Government must show that the defendant: (1) conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction; (2) which the defendant then knew involved the proceeds of unlawful activity; (3) with the intent to promote or further unlawful activity.\" Nothing in either provision suggests that the defendant must be shown to have committed the predicate offense. Moreover, simply establishing that the defendant spent or deposited the proceeds of the predicate offense is not enough without proof of an intent to promote or conceal. Either offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years and a fine of not more than $500,000. Property involved in a transaction in violation of Section 1956 is subject to civil and criminal forfeiture. Merely depositing the proceeds of a money laundering predicate offense, like mail or wire fraud, does not alone constitute a violation of Section 1956. It is enough for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957, however, if more than $10,000 is involved. Section 1957 uses Section 1956's definition of specified unlawful activities. Thus, mail and wire fraud violations may serve as the basis for the prosecution under Section 1957. \"Section 1957 differs from Section 1956 in two critical respects: It requires that the property have a value greater than $10,000, but it does not require that the defendant know of [the] design to conceal aspects of the transaction or that anyone have such a design.\" Violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000) for organizations. The property involved in a violation is subject to forfeiture under either civil or criminal procedures. This category includes the offenses that were made federal crimes because they involve fraud against the United States, or because they are other frauds that share elements with the mail and wire fraud. The most prominent are the proscriptions against defrauding the United States by the submission of false claims, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and material false statements in matters within the jurisdiction of the United States. Bank fraud, health care fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and fraud in foreign labor contracting are mail and wire fraud look-alikes. Section 287 outlaws the knowing submission of a false claim against the United States. \"To prove a false claim, the government must prove that (1) [the defendant] 'made and presented' to the government a claim, (2) 'the claim was false, fictitious, or fraudulent,' (3) [the defendant] knew the claim was false, fictitious, or fraudulent, and (4) 'the claim was material' to the government.\" The offense carries a sentence of imprisonment for not more than five years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations). The crime is one for which restitution must be ordered. There is no explicit authority for confiscation of property tainted by the offense, but either a private individual or the government may bring a civil action for treble damages under the False Claims Act. Section 287 offenses are neither RICO nor money laundering predicate offenses. Nevertheless, a defendant who presents his false claim by mail or email may find himself charged under both Section 287 and either the mail or wire fraud statutes. The general conspiracy statute has two parts. It outlaws conspiracies to violate the laws of the United States. More relevant here, it also outlaws conspiracies to defraud the United States. \"To convict on a charge under the 'defraud' clause, the government must show that the defendant (1) entered into an agreement (2) to obstruct a lawful government function (3) by deceitful or dishonest means and (4) committed at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" Thus, the \"fraud covered by the statute reaches any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing or defeating the lawful functions of any department of the Government\" by \"deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.\" Unlike mail and wire fraud, the government need not show that the scheme was designed to deprive another of money, property, or honest services; it is enough to show that the scheme is designed to obstruct governmental functions. Conspiracy to defraud the United States is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations). It is neither a RICO nor a money laundering predicate offense. It is an offense for which restitution must be ordered. There is no explicit authority for confiscation of property tainted by the offense. Section 1001 outlaws knowingly and willfully making a material false statement on a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the federal government. A matter is material for purposes of Section 1001 when \"it has a natural tendency to influence, or [is] capable of influencing, the decision of\" the individual or entity to whom it is addressed. A matter is within the jurisdiction of a federal entity \"when it has the power to exercise authority in a particular matter,\" and federal jurisdiction \"may exist when false statements [are] made to state or local government agencies receiving federal support or subject to federal regulation.\" A violation of Section 1001 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations). It is neither a RICO nor a money laundering predicate offense. It is an offense for which restitution must be ordered. There is no explicit authority for confiscation of property tainted by the offense, unless the offense relates to the activities of various federal financial receivers and conservators. Moreover, in a situation where the offense involves the submission of a false claim, either a private individual or the government may bring a civil action for treble damages under the False Claims Act. Chapter 63 contains four other fraud proscriptions in addition to mail and wire fraud: bank fraud, health care fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and fraud in foreign labor contracting. Each relies on a jurisdictional base other than use of the mail or wire communications. The bank fraud statute outlaws (1) schemes to defraud a federally insured financial institution, and (2) schemes to falsely obtain property from such an institution. To establish the bank- property scheme to defraud offense, \"the Government must prove: (1) the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution; (2) the defendant did so with the intent to defraud a financial institution; and (3) the financial institution was federally insured.\" As for the bank-custody offense, \"the government must prove (1) that a scheme existed to obtain moneys, funds, or credit in the custody of a federally-insured bank by fraud; (2) that the defendant participated in the scheme by means of material false pretenses, representations, or promises; and (3) that the defendant acted knowingly.\" Violation of either offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 years and a fine of not more than $1 million. Bank fraud is both a RICO and a money laundering predicate offense. Conviction also requires an order for victim restitution. Property constituting the proceeds of a violation is subject to forfeiture under either civil or criminal procedure. The health care fraud provision follows the pattern of other Chapter 63 offenses. It condemns schemes to defraud. The schemes it proscribes include honest services fraud in the form of bribery and kickbacks. Attempts and conspiracies to violate its prohibitions carry the same penalties as the complete offense it describes. It is often prosecuted along with other related offenses. Parsed to its elements, the section declares: [a] Whoever [b] knowingly and willfully [c] executes or attempts to execute [d] a scheme or artifice (1) to defraud any health care benefit program, or (2) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program [e] in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services shall be … Section 1347's penalty structure is somewhat distinctive. General violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years and fines of not more than $250,000. Should serious bodily injury result, however, the maximum penalty is increased to imprisonment for not more than 20 years; should death result, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life or any term of years. Section 1347 offenses are neither money laundering nor RICO predicate offenses, and proceeds of a violation of Section 1347 are not subject to confiscation. Victims, however, are entitled to restitution. Section 1348, the securities and commodities fraud prohibition, continues the progression of separating its defrauding feature from its obtaining-property feature. The elements of defrauding offense \"are (1) fraudulent intent, (2) a scheme or artifice to defraud, and (3) a nexus with a security.\" To prove a violation of Section 1348(2), the government must establish that the defendant (1) executed, or attempted to execute, a scheme or artifice; (2) with fraudulent intent; (3) in order to obtain money or property; (4) by material false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises. A conviction for mail fraud or wire fraud, or both, sometimes accompanies a conviction for securities fraud under Section 1348. Under either version of Section 1348, offenders face imprisonment for not more than 25 years and fines of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations). The offense s are neither money laundering nor RICO predicate offense s . Victim restitution must be ordered upon conviction, but forfeiture is not authorized. \"The substantive offense of fraud in foreign labor contracting [under 18 U.S.C. § 1351] occurs when someone: (1) recruits, solicits, or hires a person outside the United States, or causes another person to do so, or attempts to do so; (2) does so by means of materially false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises regarding that employment; and (3) acts knowingly and with intent to defraud.\" The offense occurs outside the United States when related to a federal contract or U.S. presence abroad. The offense is a RICO predicate offense and consequently a money laundering predicate offense as well. A restitution order is required at sentencing, but forfeiture is not authorized. After the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Skillin g v. United States , honest services mail and wire fraud consists of bribery and kickback schemes furthered by use of the mail or wire communications. Mail and wire fraud aside, the principal bribery and kickback statutes include 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(1) (bribery of federal officials), 666 (bribery relating to federal programs), 1951 (extortion under color of official right); 15 U.S.C §§ 78dd-1 to 78dd-3 (foreign corrupt practices); and 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b (Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback). Conviction for violation of Section 201(b)(1) \"requires a showing that something of value was corruptly ... offered or promised to a public official ... or corruptly ... sought ... or agreed to be received by a public official with intent ... to influence any official act ... or in return for 'being influenced in the performance of any official act.\" The hallmark of the offense is a corrupt quid pro quo, \"a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act.\" The public officials covered include federal officers and employees, those of the District of Columbia, and those who perform tasks for or on behalf of the United States or any of its departments or agencies. The official acts that constitute the objective of the corrupt bargain include any decision or action relating to any matter coming before an individual in his official capacity. Section 201 punishes bribery with imprisonment for up to 15 years, a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for an organization), and disqualification from future federal office or employment. Section 201 is a RICO predicate offense and consequently also a money laundering predicate offense. The proceeds of a bribe in violation of Section 201 are subject to forfeiture under either civil or criminal procedure. Section 666 outlaws both (1) fraud and (2) bribery by the faithless agents of state, local, tribal, or private entities—that receive more than $10,000 in federal benefits—in relation to a transaction of $5,000 or more. \"A violation of Section 666(a)(1)(A) requires proof of five elements. The government must prove that: (1) a defendant was an agent of an organization, government, or agency; (2) in a one-year period that organization, government, or agency received federal benefits in excess of $10,000; (3) a defendant … obtained by fraud … ; (4) … property owned by, or in the care, custody, or control of, the organization, government, or entity; and (5) the value of that property was at least $5,000.\" \"A person is guilty under § 666[(a)(1)(B)] if he, being an agent of an organization, government, or governmental agency that receives federal-program funds, corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\" Agents are statutorily defined as \"person[s] authorized to act on behalf of another person or a government and, in the case of an organization or government, includes a servant or employee, and a partner, director, officer, manager, and representative.\" The circuits appear divided over whether the government must establish a quid pro quo as in a Section 201 bribery case. The government, however, need not establish that the tainted transaction involves federal funds. Violations of Section 666 are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations). Section 666 offenses are money laundering predicate offenses. Section 666 offenses are not among the RICO federal predicate offenses, although bribery in violation of state felony laws is a RICO predicate offense. The proceeds of a bribe in violation of Section 666 are subject to forfeiture under either civil or criminal procedure. The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, outlaws obtaining the property of another under \"color of official right,\" in a manner that has an effect on interstate commerce. Conviction requires the government to prove that the defendant \"(1) was a government official; (2) who accepted property to which she was not entitled; (3) knowing that she was not entitled to the property; and (4) knowing that the payment was given in return for officials acts: (5) which had at least a de minimis effect on commerce.\" Conviction does not require that the public official sought or induced payment: \"the government need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.\" Hobbs Act violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organization). Hobbs Act violations are RICO predicate offenses and thus money laundering predicates as well. The proceeds of a Hobbs Act violation are subject to forfeiture under either civil or criminal procedure. The bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) are three: 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 (trade practices by issuers), 78dd-2 (trade practices by domestic concerns), and 78dd-3 (trade practices by others within the United States). Other than the class of potential defendants, the elements of the three are comparable. They make[] it a crime to: (1) willfully; (2) make use of the mail or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce; (3) corruptly; (4) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to; (5) any foreign official; (6) for purposes of [either] influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in his official capacity [or] inducing such foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official [or] securing any improper advantage; (7) in order to assist such [corporation] in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. None of the three proscriptions apply to payments \"to expedite or to secure the performance of a routine governmental action,\" and each affords defendants an affirmative defense for payments that are lawful under the applicable foreign law or regulation. Violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and by a fine of not more than $100,000 (not more than $2 million for organizations). Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations are not RICO predicate offenses, but they are money laundering predicates. The proceeds of a violation are subject to forfeiture under either civil or criminal procedure. The Medicare/Medicaid kickback prohibition in 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b) outlaws \"knowingly and willfully [offering or paying], soliciting [or] receiving, any remuneration (including any kickback) ... (A) to induce the referral of [, or (B) the purchase with respect to] Medicare [or] Medicaid beneficiaries ... any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under the Medicare [or] Medicaid programs....\" Violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and by a fine of not more than $25,000. Section 1320a-7b kickback violations are money laundering, but not RICO, predicate offenses. The proceeds of a violation are subject to forfeiture under either civil or criminal procedure. Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or such carrier according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. If the violation occurs in relation to, or involving any benefit authorized, transported, transmitted, transferred, disbursed, or paid in connection with, a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency (as those terms are defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)), or affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.

For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense under this chapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.", "answers": ["The mail and wire fraud statutes are exceptionally broad. Their scope has occasionally given the courts pause. Nevertheless, prosecutions in their name have brought to an end schemes that have bilked victims out of millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. The statutes proscribe (1) causing the use of the mail or wire communications, including email; (2) in conjunction with a scheme to intentionally defraud another of money or property; (3) by means of a material deception. The offenses, along with attempts or conspiracies to commit them, carry a term of imprisonment of up to 30 years in some cases, followed by a term of supervised release. Offenders also face the prospect of fines, orders to make restitution, and forfeiture of their property. The mail and wire fraud statutes overlap with a surprising number of other federal criminal statutes. Conduct that supports a prosecution under the mail or wire fraud statutes will often support prosecution under one or more other criminal provision(s). These companion offenses include (1) those that use mail or wire fraud as an element of a separate offense, like racketeering or money laundering; (2) those that condemn fraud on some jurisdictional basis other than use of the mail or wire communications, like those that outlaw defrauding the federal government or federally insured banks; and (3) those that proscribe other deprivations of honest services (i.e., bribery and kickbacks), like the statutes that ban bribery of federal officials or in connection with federal programs. Among the crimes for which mail or wire fraud may serve as an element, RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) outlaws employing the patterned commission of predicate offenses to conduct the affairs of an enterprise that impacts commerce. Money laundering consists of transactions involving the proceeds of a predicate offense in order to launder them or to promote further predicate offenses. The statutes that prohibit fraud in some form or another are the most diverse of the mail and wire fraud companions. Congress modeled some after the mail and wire fraud statutes, incorporating elements of a scheme to defraud or obtain property by false pretenses into statutes that outlaw bank fraud, health care fraud, securities fraud, and foreign labor contracting fraud. Congress designed others to protect the public fisc by proscribing false claims against the United States, conspiracies to defraud the United States by obstructing its functions, and false statements in matters within the jurisdiction of the United States and its departments and agencies. Federal bribery and kickback statutes populate the third class of wire and mail fraud companions. One provision bans offering or accepting a thing of value in exchange for the performance or forbearance of a federal official act. Another condemns bribery of faithless agents in connection with federally funded programs and activities. A third, the Hobbs Act, outlaws bribery as a form of extortion under the color of official right. The fines, prison sentences, and other consequences that follow conviction for wire and mail fraud companions vary considerably, with fines from not more than $25,000 to not more than $2 million and prison terms from not more than five years to life."], "length": 7674, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e7e1f1f9a6e146e6ebe8d48bdc077647df9e3c2b0251a6d5"}
{"input": "", "context": "The goal of federal government industrial security is to ensure that contractors’ security programs detect, deter, and counter the threat posed by adversaries seeking classified information. The National Industrial Security Program was established by executive order in 1993 to replace industrial security programs operated separately by various federal agencies and ensure that contractors, among others, were adequately protecting classified information. For the purposes of this report, we will use “contractor” to refer to any party that the program applies to, including contractors, grantees, licensees, certificate holders, and their respective employees. DSS is responsible for administering the National Industrial Security Program on behalf of the Department of Defense and, by mutual agreement, 32 other federal departments and agencies. Headquartered in Quantico, Virginia, and with staff in 26 field offices across four regions, DSS provides oversight, advice, and assistance to more than 12,000 U.S. facilities that are cleared for access to classified information under the program. Facilities can range in size and be located anywhere in the United States, and include manufacturing plants, laboratories, and universities. In addition, they can also include contractor personnel who travel to U.S. government sites to access classified information but do not store any classified information at their facility. There are multiple reasons why a contractor may need access to classified government information. For example, a factory may produce parts for a major weapons system using a production process that is classified, or a contractor may have employees who deliver their technical expertise in a classified environment at a military installation. As part of the facility clearance process, DSS is responsible for ensuring that cleared contractors safeguard classified information under the program by meeting requirements, which are outlined in the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with all affected agencies and with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, issues and maintains the operating manual. The operating manual addresses the contractors’ key responsibilities such as reporting incidents of suspected loss of classified information. The Information Security Oversight Office of the National Archives and Records Administration, an agency separate from the Department of Defense, monitors the National Industrial Security Program and issues implementing directives for agencies. The Information Security Oversight Office also chairs the program’s policy advisory council, which is comprised of government and industry representatives who recommend changes to industrial security policy. The Department of Defense, including DSS, has periodically issued information for contractors in the program, such as industrial security letters, to clarify the operating manual. The operating manual states that a contractor or prospective contractor is eligible for a facility clearance if it has a need for access to classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. government contracting requirement. A facility clearance is an administrative determination that, from a national security standpoint, a contractor or prospective contractor is eligible to access classified information at a specified level. A contractor’s employees cannot begin accessing classified information until the facility clearance has been granted, even if that results in delayed performance of a contract. According to the operating manual, in order for a contractor or prospective contractor to enter the program, it may be sponsored by an already cleared contractor or the government contracting activity. DSS requires information about the contract, subcontract, or solicitation that necessitates a clearance, such as level of safeguarding required and a brief description of the procurement. Within the government contracting activity, the information may be provided by the contracting office, program office, or security office. DSS begins its facility clearance process once it receives the information and assigns the case to an industrial security representative at a local DSS field office. The industrial security representative serves as the primary point of contact for the sponsored facility during the clearance process and once the contractor is eligible to access classified information. Across DSS field offices and headquarters, multiple people are involved in the facility clearance process, including those who specialize in information systems or others who have experience with analyzing contractors for indicators of foreign influence. See figure 1 for more details about how DSS processes a facility clearance. As shown in the figure above, DSS also reviews the contractor’s ownership and business structure to assess whether foreign interests indicate a contractor is under foreign influence, which could lead to disclosure of classified information to foreign nationals. Contractors are required to answer questions about whether there is foreign involvement in their ownership, board composition, debt, source of revenues, and any other situations where foreign nationals might be in a position to influence their operations. If DSS determines that there is a risk for foreign influence, the contractor is ineligible for a facility clearance unless, and until, security measures are put in place, such as negotiating a mitigation agreement with DSS. As of June 2017, approximately 630 of the over 12,000 cleared facilities in the program have mitigation agreements in place to address foreign influence. As part of the facility clearance process, certain personnel, such as the facility security officer, must receive personnel clearances to the level of the facility clearance. In the personnel clearance process, specialists at DSS headquarters grant interim clearances to U.S. citizens based on national security standards and information from background investigations conducted by the Office of Personnel Management, if there is no adverse information of material significance. Before the facility clearance can be granted, a DSS industrial security representative verifies that the key management personnel have received their permanent clearance. After DSS completes the facility clearance process and determines that a contractor is eligible to access classified information and grants the facility security clearance, the cleared contractor officially enters the National Industrial Security Program. Once in the program, contractors establish a security program at cleared facilities or implement security measures required by the Department of Defense security agreement, as well as any elements required by DSS. Depending on the facility, security measures may address a variety of industrial security issues. For example, a contractor may be required to start using visitor logs or badges to track every person with physical access to a facility or establish separate computer systems for the sole purpose of storing classified information. In addition, contractors are required to implement insider threat programs, which are meant to prevent persons with approved access to classified information, such as contractor employees, from causing harm to national security through unauthorized disclosures. The insider threat programs may include activities such as training programs about reporting requirements or monitoring classified information systems. DSS monitors cleared contractor facilities to determine their compliance with the program’s requirements for protecting classified information by conducting periodic security reviews. DSS determines the frequency of these reviews, although they generally cannot take place more than once in a 12-month period, according to the operating manual. The duration of security reviews and the size of the team conducting them vary by facility. For example, a single industrial security representative can perform a review of a small facility with no classified information stored on site in one day. By comparison, a large facility may require a lengthier review that involves additional DSS officials, such as information system security professionals who review a facility’s information systems if they are needed to store or process classified information. Moreover, counterintelligence officials may also participate and provide threat information about the facility. Security reviews are generally led by staff located in DSS’s 26 field offices across the country. A contractor’s facility clearance may be subject to invalidation or revocation if DSS identifies certain vulnerabilities, among other things. See figure 2 for more information about DSS’s process for monitoring contractor facilities in the program. In addition to administering the facility clearance process and conducting security reviews at cleared facilities, DSS also collects information from cleared contractors about suspicious contacts, which may involve efforts by an individual to obtain illegal or unauthorized access to classified information, among other things. DSS aggregates this information to identify counterintelligence trends among cleared contractors and refers cases to the relevant agency for further investigation or action. We last issued reports about the National Industrial Security Program in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, we made eight recommendations for DSS to improve its processes for conducting security reviews, such as taking steps to quickly notify government contracting activities when classified information has been lost or compromised. The Department of Defense agreed with our recommendations. In 2005, we made eight recommendations about DSS’s oversight of contractors under foreign influence. For example, we recommended that DSS collect and analyze data about foreign business transactions in order to improve its oversight of contractors under foreign influence. The Department of Defense partially agreed with our recommendations and subsequently took action to address them. As of April 2018, 13 of 16 of the recommendations have been implemented. For more detail on our prior recommendations, please see appendix II. Since 2005, when we last reviewed how DSS administered the National Industrial Security Program, it has streamlined its facility clearance process in order to make it more efficient. DSS has also strengthened the process to analyze contractors for foreign influence and the Department of Defense issued a rule to clarify policies and procedures for mitigating foreign influence concerns. Despite upgrading its capabilities, DSS continues to face challenges in monitoring cleared contractors with access to classified information. In 2004 and 2005, we reported that DSS did not collect and analyze data on contractors operating in the National Industrial Security Program. For example, DSS was not able to analyze data to make informed resource decisions or track key changes that affect contractors operating under foreign influence. In our 2005 report, we recommended that DSS collect and analyze data about foreign business transactions, among other things. As a result, DSS streamlined its facility clearance process by developing two electronic systems for tracking the facility clearance requests and maintaining information on cleared facilities. 1. The Electronic Facility Clearance System is a web-based system that contractors or prospective contractors use to submit their required information, such as key management personnel and other staff who need to be cleared for access as well as business-related items like articles of incorporation, bylaws, and other supporting documentation. 2. The Industrial Security Facilities Database is another web-based system that serves as a repository for information about cleared facilities. DSS field office and contractor officials we spoke with noted that the web- based systems help them do their job more efficiently. For example, DSS’s industrial security representatives stated that these systems make the facility clearance and monitoring process more efficient because it is easier to track the status of documentation received. Industrial security representatives also track conditions that may require changes to their monitoring process through this database, such as a change in ownership or key management personnel. Industrial security representatives noted that being able to track this information electronically is helpful because the facility clearance and monitoring processes involve numerous officials within DSS, as well as other parties, such as the government contracting activity and the contractor. For example, a government contracting activity can use the database to check whether a facility has been cleared to store classified information onsite before sending materials to them. In 2017, DSS started the process of modernizing these systems by developing two new systems. DSS officials stated that these two new systems will provide additional automation that can be used in the facility clearance and monitoring processes. The new systems are: National Industrial Security Program Contracts Classification System. This system collects detailed information about classified contract(s) a facility will support during the initial clearance process as well as throughout the duration of the facility’s clearance, to include the facility’s assets (e.g. technology produced or expertise provided), and enables the government contracting activity to gain visibility into the subcontractors performing work for each classified contract. National Industrial Security System. This system will be the official repository for data on cleared facilities. DSS officials noted that the system will help identify foreign influence concerns, such as changes in a contractor’s ownership, because they will be more centrally tracked. Further, in 2017, DSS also issued a manual to reflect an updated process for assessing and authorizing cleared contractors’ information systems that process classified information. DSS changed its process to align with the intelligence community, the Department of Defense, and other federal government agencies’ standards. DSS previously reviewed systems on regular cycles and is shifting to reflect practices in the intelligence community that are based on assessed threats and target the information systems that pose the most significant risk of losing information. DSS information security system professionals told us that this new authorization process is helping them clarify and communicate the nature of security risks to the contractor. The updated process is intended to include the identification of cybersecurity concerns earlier than the prior approach and enables DSS’s information system security professionals to adjust their monitoring to meet emerging cyber threats. In response to recommendations we made in 2005, DSS has centralized its support related to identifying and mitigating foreign influence and strengthened its process, including issuing a rule to make the process of mitigation of foreign influence clearer to contractors. Since our last review of the program in 2005, DSS has centralized staff expertise in headquarters to improve the identification and mitigation of foreign influence concerns. Whereas DSS used to rely primarily on field staff to negotiate and oversee individual facilities in their respective regions, it now has staff in headquarters, including specialists in law and other areas, who have an agency-wide view of threats and who understand the portfolio of contractors that may be at risk of foreign influence. DSS officials said that this is important because a contractor may have multiple cleared facilities across several regions. They noted that an agency-wide view helps DSS identify trends across facilities that may be tied to a single contractor. The headquarters staff: negotiate and put in place mitigation agreements that require contractors under foreign influence to acknowledge and mitigate foreign influence risks, including the development of protective measures to reduce the risk of foreign interests gaining access to classified information; identify foreign influence within cleared contractors and provide written analysis to DSS field offices when foreign influence concerns are identified, such as when a foreign contractor acquires a majority or substantial minority position in a U.S. contractor with a cleared facility; and provide subject matter expertise in the areas of business, acquisition, intelligence, and international law to develop a comprehensive understanding of companies, their industries and technologies, as well as the regulatory environments in foreign countries. DSS officials acknowledged that the establishment of a headquarters division in 2008 focused on analyzing foreign influence and issuing related publications was in response to recommendations we made in 2005. DSS’s field office industrial security representatives said that the written products and specialized foreign influence analysis prepared and disseminated by DSS headquarters has resulted in more timely identification and mitigation of these issues. Examples include: NISP in the News, an internal weekly publication that provides a summary of business transactions that may result in the need for a mitigation agreement to address foreign influence. Industrial security representatives we spoke with said this publication helps them identify and proactively address issues with their contractors. DSS officials told us the publication is helpful because it can result in more timely identification and initiate the process for negotiating a mitigation agreement, particularly in cases where a foreign company acquires a facility previously owned by a U.S. contractor. Copies of NISP in the News that we reviewed also included information that may affect contractors that are not under a mitigation agreement for foreign influence, such as changes in key management personnel. We previously reported that DSS had challenges identifying these transactions or facility security officers would neglect to report them, which led to delays in putting protective measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to classified information. Assessments of new contractors that have been sponsored for clearances, which are used to identify and mitigate foreign influence. DSS industrial security representatives stated that this analysis used to be performed in the field but now they can use time previously spent preparing analysis of foreign influence to work with contractors to implement security measures. Further, the assessments help them work more effectively with contractors because they draw upon expertise across different disciplines. For example, 7 of the 13 facility case files we reviewed contained a summary of analysis conducted by specialists in DSS headquarters. The summaries also noted that the specialists reviewed classified and unclassified information on the contractor, including counterintelligence information and other U.S. government information, as applicable. In April 2014, the Department of Defense issued a rule about policies and procedures for mitigating foreign ownership, control, or influence. This rule was issued in order to ensure maximum uniformity and effectiveness in the Department of Defense implementation of the National Industrial Security Program. The rule detailed specific mitigation approaches for addressing concerns about foreign ownership, control, or influence, which we cover in detail in appendix I. The rule clarified the role of DSS, the government contracting activity, and the contractor during the process when DSS determines that the contractor needs to mitigate potential foreign ownership, control, or influence. The rule also documented policies and procedures regarding how decisions will be made on the appropriate method to mitigate foreign ownership, control, or influence. These include the timing of agency and contractor actions involved in mitigation of foreign ownership, control, or influence and how to proceed in cases where the contractor had not worked out a mitigation agreement with DSS before changed conditions (e.g. indebtedness, ownership, or foreign intelligence threat) occurred, among other things. The rule further stated that DSS, in consultation with the government contracting activity, has discretion to modify or reject the contractor’s outlined action plan to mitigate foreign ownership, control, or influence. Despite upgrading its capabilities, DSS officials indicated that they face resource constraints, such as an inability to manage workloads and complete training necessary to stay informed on current threats and technologies. DSS’s current resource challenges include: Managing staff workloads. DSS field officials acknowledged that they have historically faced workload challenges. DSS officials said that their limited staff carry heavy workloads and, according to DSS’s most recent biennial report to Congress, were unable to conduct security reviews at about 60 percent of cleared facilities in fiscal year 2016. In addition to their official security reviews, industrial security representatives also conduct informal “advise and assist” efforts when facility officials inquire about a range of security issues, from preparing employees for overseas travel to providing training on reporting suspicious contacts. In fiscal year 2016, industrial security representatives conducted about 22,000 “advise and assist” efforts. DSS officials attribute the heavy workload to the current staffing levels of their field offices and frequent turnover among the industrial security representatives. DSS officials noted that both hiring and retention are difficult and that these challenges are exacerbated by the fact that it is a relatively small agency with field offices with limited staff. For example, an average field office oversees about 470 facilities and has about 8 industrial security representatives on staff. As a result, if a person leaves, it adds strain to the remaining staff. Most of the contractors’ facility security officers we spoke with noted that DSS field officials have heavy workloads that could affect their ability to respond to threats at cleared facilities. Further, DSS indicated that it has limited resources to analyze, process, and distribute counterintelligence to the cleared facilities. For example, DSS received more than 46,000 reports from cleared contractors about suspicious contacts in fiscal year 2016, which was an almost 18 percent increase over the prior year. In comparison, during the same time period, DSS’s counterintelligence directorate, which analyzes suspicious contact reports, grew by 7 percent. In addition, DSS’s ability to distribute counterintelligence is limited by the geographic distribution of over 12,000 cleared facilities and each facility’s capability to receive or store classified communication. Developing foreign influence mitigation agreements. Multiple DSS industrial security representatives and contractors’ facility security officers stated that mitigation agreements to address the risk of foreign influence, including supplemental plans, have become more detailed and the process to develop and implement them has required additional time and resources. For example, DSS may require a contractor to develop an electronic communications plan, which must include details about which networks will be protected from access by a foreign parent contractor, including monitoring, maintaining, and establishing separate email servers, as appropriate. DSS reported in its 2015 biennial report to Congress that the average amount of time to approve and implement a foreign influence mitigation plan was 93 days. The length of time to approve and implement a foreign influence mitigation plan more than doubled to 204 days, according to the 2017 biennial report. DSS officials stated that this increase is due, in part, to increased complexity of the agreements and the amount of coordination required between the government contracting activity, DSS, and the contractor. A DSS official also noted that over time, the agency has incorporated more information in its analysis and sometimes needs more time to review all the information that may be relevant. Attending relevant trainings. DSS officials in three of four regions noted that staffing challenges affect their ability to take training, even though industrial security matters continue to become more sophisticated. Information system security professionals said they face challenges in learning technology that continues to evolve. For example, they cited the multiple software products such as operating systems and configurations of information networks that are used in a facility’s daily operations. In addition, they need to understand other technologies that can pose risks to industrial security, such as devices that are capable of transmitting data, like cellular phones, and therefore might need to be prohibited from areas where classified information is discussed. As a result, the lack of expertise in multiple technologies hampers their ability to identify vulnerabilities that might leave a facility at risk for loss of classified information. We have previously reported that training staff in new skills, such as cybersecurity, remains an ongoing challenge for the federal government. For example, in 2016, we found that chief information officers throughout the government identified difficulties related to recruiting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel, as well as ensuring they have the appropriate skills and expertise. In 2017, DSS announced its plans to transition to a new approach to monitoring cleared facilities in order to address emerging threats to classified information. DSS faces challenges as it pilots its new approach—DSS in Transition. DSS has taken steps to begin addressing challenges, including scheduling training for its staff, but has not documented how it will collaborate with its stakeholders or identified the resources needed to monitor cleared facilities. In 2017, DSS announced that it would begin transitioning to an asset-and- threat-based monitoring approach. DSS has reported that the United States is facing the most significant foreign intelligence threat it has ever encountered and adversaries are attacking cleared facilities at unprecedented rates. In fact, adversaries are varying their methods and adjusting their priorities based on the targeted information they need. The new approach is expected to involve DSS working collaboratively with contractors and government contracting activities to design a customized security plan for each facility based on threats specific to its assets rather than using a standardized worksheet to perform security reviews. DSS officials said that customized security plans will be developed based on assets at the specific facilities. For example, a contractor providing information technology services may need the latest software to thwart cyberattacks while a contractor that engineers weapons systems may need additional secure storage facilities and work areas to ensure an adversary cannot physically extract classified information or technology. As a result, according to agency officials, these customized security plans represent a departure from a “one size fits all” or schedule-driven approach to overseeing contractors’ protection of classified information. According to DSS officials, this new approach, DSS in Transition will use the Department of Defense’s list of critical technologies and programs, along with counterintelligence, to prioritize facilities for security reviews based on their assets and the severity of the threats to them. See table 1 for more information about the monitoring approaches. After announcing DSS in Transition in 2017, DSS began taking steps to develop its methodology for the new approach, including prioritization of facilities and developing procedures for executing customized security plans. In a January 2018 letter to industry, DSS stated that it plans to pilot the new approach by working with one facility in each of its four regions to develop a customized security plan and use the lessons learned to refine the process. While it is piloting the approach at four facilities, DSS notified contractors not participating in the pilot that DSS would partner with selected facilities to identify and document their critical assets. Industry, including contractors and prospective contractors that are interested in U.S. government contract awards in the future, are awaiting more details on how DSS plans to implement DSS in Transition, including who would be responsible for the costs of additional security requirements, according to a March 2018 statement from the industry spokesperson of the National Industrial Security Program Policy Advisory Committee. Although DSS began piloting DSS in Transition in January 2018, it has not determined how it will collaborate with government contracting activities, the intelligence community, other federal agencies, and contractors. In particular, DSS has not identified its stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities in terms of who needs to communicate and coordinate with whom and when, which is necessary to successfully implement the new approach. For example, DSS needs to establish agreed-upon criteria for what information a government contracting activity would need to provide to DSS in order to develop a customized security plan for a facility. GAO’s Federal Internal Control Standards establish the need to coordinate with stakeholders and clearly define roles and responsibilities, among other things. In addition, our leading practices for interagency collaboration state that successful collaborative working relationships require organizations to agree on roles and responsibilities and identify the resources necessary to accomplish objectives. For example, GAO found it is unclear how DSS will determine what resources it needs as it has not identified the necessary roles and responsibilities. DSS has taken steps to begin addressing these challenges by establishing an office dedicated to documenting processes and procedures for how DSS in Transition will be implemented, providing a concept of operations, and scheduling training for its staff. However, to monitor cleared facilities, DSS needs information from the various National Industrial Security Program stakeholders, including: Government contracting activity. DSS officials stated that, under the new approach to monitoring cleared facilities, they will need to better communicate and coordinate with the government contracting activity. For example, in some circumstances, DSS officials will have to collaborate with government contracting activities to determine when a security plan is no longer sufficient as threats and mitigation methods evolve. DSS officials stated that communication and coordination with government contracting activities has been a challenge because industrial security is often considered an added duty on top of their contract management responsibilities. Further, DSS officials indicated that staff turnover at government contracting activities and the lack of clear roles and responsibilities have led to delays in resolving a facility’s vulnerabilities. According to DSS officials, it is difficult to determine whether they have the correct point of contact at the government contracting activity to discuss vulnerabilities at a facility, which, if left unaddressed, can leave classified information at risk for loss. There are no formal agreements about how a case should be elevated and resolved if DSS identifies vulnerabilities and is unable to elicit a response from the government contracting activity about further action, according to DSS officials. In addition, DSS officials stated that they will need to work with the government contracting activity to assess the risk of security vulnerabilities that involve subcontractors working on contracts containing classified information. In the past, a government contracting activity might not know the identities of subcontractors if they were sponsored by a cleared contractor. Given the adversaries’ ability to vary its methods to target information it needs, the government needs to know who—regardless of subcontracting tier—is accessing classified information. Government intelligence community. We found DSS has not established how it will collaborate with the intelligence community, including formalizing roles and responsibilities for its new approach. A DSS counterintelligence official told us that DSS currently relies on a combination of its own counterintelligence staff and informal coordination with other agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Another DSS official stated that they have worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to deliver counterintelligence when a facility does not have the capacity to receive classified information electronically. According to DSS field officials, the current process is handled on a case-by-case basis, depending on the availability of resources. Although DSS’s Counterintelligence Directorate recently became part of the intelligence community and will potentially have greater access to counterintelligence data, it will need to determine how to regularly communicate with the intelligence community to fully understand their products and share current threats and vulnerabilities with certain contractors under DSS in Transition. Other government agencies. DSS relies on collaborating with other cognizant security agencies to develop a complete picture of the threats to contractors. In addition to the Department of Defense, there are four other federal agencies that have authority to inspect and monitor facilities to ensure the protection of classified information. DSS may only conduct security reviews for facilities performing contracts awarded by these agencies if the Department of Defense is the cognizant security agency for that facility. Contracts where another agency is the cognizant security agency may involve information coveted by adversaries, but DSS industrial security representatives have acknowledged that they may not know why the information is coveted or that it exists. Given the new approach to develop a complete picture of threats to a facility, DSS will need additional information from other cognizant security agencies that it may not have sought in the past. As a result, DSS needs to establish how best to collaborate with other agencies, such as identifying appropriate points of contacts and specific time frames to conduct outreach, to effectively implement DSS’s new approach to monitor contractors. Cleared contractors. DSS officials said that DSS in Transition will require contractors to identify assets in a greater level of detail than what was previously expected of them. In order to develop a security plan unique to the facility, the contractor’s facility security officers will need to understand these assets and why adversaries would want to target them in order to develop and implement specific security measures. Since DSS officials cannot be onsite every day, they have to rely on the contractor’s facility security officer or other key management personnel at cleared facilities to identify and report potential problems. However, DSS officials noted that convincing facility staff to spend more time on security-related matters may be difficult at facilities where one employee may serve as the contractor’s facility security officer in addition to having other responsibilities. In addition, DSS officials stated that contractors’ security costs are typically not profit-generators and realize that DSS in Transition may require the contractor to expend more time, money, and energy to address vulnerabilities or enact policies to safeguard against adversaries. DSS recognizes the need to keep industry informed and its implementation plans for DSS in Transition need to address what level of communication and coordination is required. For example, DSS currently uses a rating system to indicate how well a contractor is meeting the requirements of the operating manual as a metric for how it is protecting classified information. As DSS moves toward developing customized security plans that are unique to each facility’s threats and assets, it needs to formalize new approaches to communicate with contractors how well they are protecting classified information. In addition to piloting DSS in Transition, DSS is reassuming responsibility for conducting background and security investigations for the Department of Defense, which could potentially magnify its workload challenges. DSS previously held these responsibilities but they were transitioned to the Office of Personnel Management in 2005. The National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2018 required DSS to reassume this background and security investigations mission by implementing a phased transition by October 1, 2020. This phased transition will overlap with DSS’s piloting of DSS in Transition and may create disruptions as an agency of over 700 employees assumes responsibility for a background and security investigations mission that currently has more than 7,000 employees and contractors. In January 2018, we added personnel security clearances to our high-risk list, a list of federal areas in need of either broad-based transformation or specific reforms to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. This issue is on the list because we identified: (1) a significant backlog of background investigations; (2) a lack of long-term goals for increasing federal and contractor-provided investigator capacity to address the backlog; and (3) delays in the timely processing of security clearances among other factors. DSS officials have identified potential benefits and challenges with reassuming the background investigations mission, and, in August 2017, the Department of Defense submitted a plan for a 3-year phased transition to assume the background and security investigations mission. In March 2018, we reported that this transition could potentially affect the timely processing of personnel security clearances, the backlog, and other reform initiatives but the effect is unknown at this time. Given the changing nature of threats to classified information, DSS needs to ensure that classified information is protected from unauthorized access. While DSS has upgraded its capabilities for identifying foreign influence, DSS officials acknowledged that adversaries continue to evolve, and classified information and technologies remain vulnerable to exploitation. In response, in 2017, DSS launched a new approach (DSS in Transition) to change how it oversees contractors with access to classified information. As DSS pilots the new approach, it will need to work with government contracting activities, the intelligence community, other agencies, and cleared contractors to determine their roles and responsibilities in protecting classified information at every facility in the program. Without the necessary information—that is gained through communicating and coordinating with stakeholders—to assess the threats to the nation’s most critical technologies and programs, DSS will be unable to provide appropriate oversight that addresses the most significant threats to industrial security. Also, DSS has not identified the resources necessary, including the number of personnel needed to implement its new approach, which will add pressure to an agency accepting a background and security investigations mission that has significant backlog and timeliness challenges. Until DSS identifies roles and responsibilities and determines how it will collaborate with stakeholders for the pilot, it will be difficult to assess whether the new approach is effective in protecting classified information. We are making one recommendation to the Director of the Defense Security Service: Determine how it will collaborate with stakeholders as it pilots a new approach to overseeing contractors with cleared facilities (DSS in Transition), including identifying roles and responsibilities and the related resources needed. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to DSS. DSS provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix III. In its comments, DSS concurred with the recommendation and summarized actions it is taking to pilot its new approach (DSS in Transition). DSS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, Director of DSS, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. Since our July 2005 report, the Defense Security Service (DSS) has taken additional steps to address oversight of contractors with foreign influence. In April 2014, the Department of Defense issued a rule that clarified policies for oversight of contractors under foreign ownership, control, or influence. The rule detailed specific mitigation approaches for addressing foreign ownership, control, or influence concerns. The rule provided detail regarding the terms of each of these types of foreign ownership, control, or influence mitigation agreements and the circumstances under which each may be appropriate. The types of mitigation specified in the rule are: Board Resolution. The board resolution may be used when a foreign entity does not own voting interests sufficient to elect a representative to the company’s governing board. Security Control Agreement. The security control agreement is a tailored foreign ownership, control, or influence mitigation agreement, often used when a foreign interest does not effectively own or control a company or corporate family but the foreign interest is entitled to representation on the company’s board. Special Security Agreement. The special security agreement may be used when a company is effectively owned or controlled by a foreign interest. Access to certain proscribed classified information by a company cleared under this agreement may require that the government contracting activity complete a National Interest Determination to determine that the release of proscribed information to the company is consistent with the national security interests of the United States. Voting Trust Agreement and Proxy Agreement. These foreign ownership, control, or influence mitigation agreements may be used when a foreign interest effectively owns or controls a company or corporate family. Under these agreements, the foreign owner relinquishes most rights associated with ownership of the company to cleared United States citizens approved by the U.S. government. DSS has clarified the types of supplemental plans that companies must submit to document specific steps that it will take to mitigate foreign influence. Table 2 describes the types of plans and provides examples of how they mitigate foreign influence. In 2004 and 2005, GAO issued reports about the National Industrial Security Program and made 16 recommendations. Prior to the start of our review, the Department of Defense, through the Defense Security Service (DSS), implemented two of the recommendations. Below is our assessment of whether DSS addressed the remaining 14 recommendations that had been previously recorded as “closed – not implemented”. Table 3 provides a summary of those recommendations and the actions that DSS has taken in response to the recommendations. A number of the recommendations we made were aimed at clarifying policies related to contractors under foreign influence that were part of the National Industrial Security Program. The primary evidence to support our conclusions is cited in the last column. In GAO-04-332, we made eight recommendations that were recorded as closed not implemented prior to the start of this review. Based on information obtained during this review, seven of the recommendations will be closed as implemented. The recommendation that remains closed as not implemented was outside of the scope of the current review. In GAO-05-681, we made eight recommendations and two of the recommendations were closed as implemented prior to this review. Based on information obtained during this review, four of the remaining six recommendations will be closed as implemented. We were unable to close two of the six recommendations as implemented based on the information provided during this review. Marie A. Mak, (202) 512-4841 or makm@gao.gov.

The National Industrial Security Program was established in 1993 to safeguard federal government classified information that may be or has been released to contractors, among others. GAO last reported on this program in 2005 and the Department of Defense has since implemented 13 of the 16 related recommendations. GAO was asked to examine how DSS administers the program. This report assesses to what extent DSS: 1) changed how it administers the program since GAO's last report; and 2) addressed challenges as it pilots a new approach to monitoring contractors with access to classified information. GAO reviewed guidance and regulations since 2005, including the program's operating manual. GAO analyzed data from DSS's electronic databases and also selected a non-generalizable sample of contractor facilities based on clearance level, geographic location, and type of agreement to address foreign influence. We also reviewed documents and interviewed relevant government and contractor officials. The Defense Security Service (DSS) has upgraded its capabilities but also faces challenges in administering the National Industrial Security Program, which applies to all executive branch departments and agencies, and was established to safeguard federal government classified information that current or prospective contractors may access. Since we last reported on this program in 2005, DSS has: streamlined facility clearance and monitoring processes, and strengthened the process for identifying contractors with potential foreign influence. However, under its current approach, DSS officials indicated that they face resource constraints, such as an inability to manage workloads and complete training necessary to stay informed on current threats and technologies. In its most recent report to Congress, DSS stated that it was unable to conduct security reviews at about 60 percent of cleared facilities in fiscal year 2016. Further, DSS recently declared that the United States is facing the most significant foreign intelligence threat it has ever encountered. As a result, in 2017, DSS announced plans to transition to a new monitoring approach to address emerging threats at facilities in the program. For a comparison of the current and new approaches, see below. DSS has not addressed immediate challenges that are critical to piloting this new approach. For example, GAO found it is unclear how DSS will determine what resources it needs as it has not identified roles and responsibilities. Moreover, DSS has not established how it will collaborate with stakeholders—government contracting activities, the government intelligence community, other government agencies, and contractors—under the new approach. Federal Internal Control Standards establish the importance of coordinating with stakeholders, including clearly defining roles and responsibilities. In addition, GAO's leading practices for interagency collaboration state that it is important for organizations to identify the resources necessary to accomplish objectives. Until DSS identifies roles and responsibilities and determines how it will collaborate with stakeholders for the piloting effort, it will be difficult to assess whether the new approach is effective in protecting classified information. GAO recommends DSS determine how it will collaborate with stakeholders, including identifying roles and responsibilities and related resources, as it pilots a new approach. DSS concurred with the recommendation."], "length": 7132, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bb02cffdbe43c202f95f4e90ccbdca9de7b40903b401c0db"}
{"input": "", "context": "The Selected Reserve comprises over 811,000 full- and part-time members from the military services’ respective National Guard and reserve components, whom DOD can call to active duty to augment military forces in time of war or national emergency. DOD requires these reservists to maintain readiness by participating regularly in training to maintain the military skills needed to perform their mission. About 91 percent of the members of the Selected Reserve, or 735,876 reservists, are part-time, performing military service in addition to their civilian employment and careers. Reservists typically train for about 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks a year. Reservists may also be required to participate in longer duration training to develop and maintain specialized skills related to their military occupation, such as cyber specialists, or to perform other activities such as backfilling positions in other reserve or active units. The following are descriptions of reservists’ required training and other duties: Annual Training: All six reserve components require an annual training period, typically 2 weeks, to acquire and maintain required military skills. Inactive Duty Training: This training is commonly referred to as the “1 weekend a month” commitment, and reservists fulfill this commitment in connection with prescribed training or maintenance activities of the units to which they are assigned. Active Duty for Training: So that reservists acquire and maintain required military skills, individuals serving as reservists participate in training programs such as initial basic training and advanced individual training, and may attend full time specialized schools. The duration of Active Duty for Training varies considerably, from days to several months. Active Duty Other than Training: All six reserve components may require that reservists perform other support activities, such as backfilling a position in a reserve or active unit. For a variety of reasons, reservists may not live in the same location where they train. For example, reservists may relocate for their civilian occupation, and officials told us that as reservists are promoted, command opportunities are more geographically dispersed. As a result, travel may be necessary to facilitate their service. DOD’s six reserve components reported paying or reimbursing over $925 million in travel costs for reservists in fiscal year 2015, representing about 4.3 percent of the total obligations identified in the Reserve Personnel accounts. With an actual part-time endstrength of 742,683 reservists in fiscal year 2015, DOD spent an average cost of about $1,246 per reservist. Officials told us that DOD does not specifically collect and track data on reservists’ unreimbursed travel expenses, which are therefore unknown. Officials told us that reservists process their travel claims through DOD-wide or military-service-based electronic data systems, such as the Defense Travel Service or the Air Force’s Reserve Travel System, or sometimes using hard-copy forms, depending on the type of duty performed, the reserve component, and other factors. DOD’s Joint Travel Regulations govern the extent to which reservists are eligible to be reimbursed for travel expenses to participate in required training or in other duties. The regulations authorize the reimbursement of different types of expenses depending on the nature and duration of the assignment. Eligible reimbursements include: Per diem, which includes reimbursement for food, temporary lodging, Transportation expenses, ranging from reimbursement for mileage traveled in reservists’ private vehicles to reimbursement for commercial flights; Permanent Change of Station reimbursements related to reservists changing their home of record to the location of the assignment, such as reimbursement for the movement of household goods; and Basic Allowance for Housing, which is based on the costs of adequate rental properties for civilians with comparable income levels in the same location as the permanent duty station, which in the case of reservists is generally the location of their home; is received when reservists are in an active duty status, which includes Active Duty for Training and Active Duty Other than Training; and is determined based on the duration of reservists’ active duty assignments. Reservists also receive cash compensation for the various types of training and other duties they perform; non-cash compensation, such as access to TRICARE Reserve Select and education benefits; and deferred compensation, such as participation in the military retirement system. In addition, reservists may be able to take advantage of a federal tax deduction for out-of-pocket travel expenses associated with their service. Reservists may incur expenses under certain conditions in connection with their service that are not reimbursable under DOD’s travel regulations. Officials responsible for travel regulations and reserve policy issues told us that this can occur because: (1) the cost to attend Inactive Duty Training is a reservist’s responsibility, except in limited circumstances; and (2) DOD designates longer duration training or assignments as a Permanent Change of Station—a change in a reservist’s home of record—and not as temporary travel. Under most circumstances, travel expenses to and from the 1 weekend a month training commitment are reservists’ responsibility with no reimbursement provided, and as a result reservists may incur unreimbursed travel expenses to attend this training. Specifically, the Joint Travel Regulations states that a reserve component member performing Inactive Duty Training ordinarily receives no travel or transportation allowances, particularly when the training duty is performed at the reservist’s assigned unit location. This principle is reflected in travel policy such as the Navy Reserve’s requirement that reservists who live more than 100 miles from their Inactive Duty Training site sign a waiver acknowledging that they will not be reimbursed for travel expenses. Navy travel policy, citing a previous version of the Joint Travel Regulations, states that as part of the requirement to perform Inactive Duty Training, “inherent to this obligation is the travel between the member’s home and the location at which the member normally performs drills” with no reimbursement provided. To mitigate expenses incurred by reservists traveling long distances, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 established a reimbursement program for Inactive Duty Training whereby each component may, at the discretion of the service Secretary and under certain circumstances, provide reimbursement of up to $300 in expenses for each roundtrip to the training location. The Joint Travel Regulations further specifies that reservists must travel no fewer than 150 miles or greater one way from their primary residence to their normal drilling site to be eligible. DOD spent nearly $33.5 million on Inactive Duty Training travel costs in fiscal year 2015. While each service Secretary decides whether an individual component can participate in the program, the Joint Travel Regulations requires such programs to make servicemembers eligible for reimbursement when they meet one of the following criteria: They are qualified in a skill designated as critically short by the Secretary assigned to a unit of the Selected Reserve with a critical staffing shortage, or in a pay grade in the reservists’ component with a critical staffing shortage; or assigned to a unit or position that is disestablished or relocated as a result of Base Realignment and Closure or other force structure reallocation. See table 1 for scenarios illustrating reimbursement eligibility for Inactive Duty Training expenses in the Army Reserve. Three of the six reserve components have established policies to allow for reimbursement of expenses of travel related to Inactive Duty Training, according to component-specific criteria. The Marine Corps Reserve and the Air Force Reserve authorize Inactive Duty Training reimbursement for several occupations, and in the case of the Marine Corps Reserve, entire rank levels. The Army Reserve authorizes reimbursement, but according to its policy targets reimbursements to soldiers and units with the highest payoff in achieving readiness. Specifically, Army Reserve commanders establish Inactive Duty Training reimbursement policy that designates and prioritizes positions, units, and occupational specialties eligible to participate. Both Air National Guard and Army National Guard officials told us that their respective components do not authorize Inactive Duty Training reimbursement. Similarly, Navy officials told us that the Navy does not participate in the reimbursement program, primarily because under its training construct Navy reservists conduct most Inactive Duty Training at a Navy Operational Support Center close to their homes, thereby limiting the training that may occur at a further distance from their homes to a minority of sessions. Travel distances for reservists to their drilling site may have increased over time. For example, the 2012 Report of the Eleventh Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation noted that reservists traditionally lived near a reserve site or drilling location, but reported that at the time of its review more than 100,000 reservists lived more than 100 miles from their drilling locations. Further, according to a 2008 report by the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, after Base Realignment and Closure actions some reservists may have fewer locations available to them to perform such training. As a result, reservists may be travelling greater distances to attend such training. Officials also told us that the travel distances required to attend Inactive Duty Training can be further increased as reservists progress in their careers in certain occupational specialties or ranks. For example, officials from the Marine Corps Reserve told us that as reservists are promoted to higher ranks, there are fewer positions, which can result in long-distance travel by reservists, while Army Reserve officials told us that some reservists may turn down command positions to avoid long-distance travel. DOD’s Joint Travel Regulations treats Active Duty for Training and other assignments of long-duration as a Permanent Change of Station, or a change in a reservist’s home of record, generally his or her civilian home, and not as Temporary Duty. The treatment of long-duration training or other assignments as a Permanent Change of Station applies equally to reservists and active component members, as DOD travel regulations require all military personnel at a given training or assignment to be in the same status. However, officials told us that due to the interim nature of such assignments reservists are unlikely to move their families, and reservists may incur unreimbursed expenses due to the cost of maintaining two homes. For example, according to a reserve policy official, based on an internal analysis, about two-thirds of Air Reserve members on long-duration training do not move from their civilian homes. Further, the 2012 Report of the Eleventh Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation concluded that reservists would likely return to their civilian homes and employers at the conclusion of their assignments. In addition, officials stated that long-duration training is becoming more common. For example, Army language or medical training can routinely last longer than 140 days and require a Permanent Change of Station. The treatment of long-duration training and other assignments as a Permanent Change of Station and not as Temporary Duty affects the type of expenses that will be reimbursed and the Basic Allowance for Housing rate received by reservists. A Permanent Change of Station is triggered when Active Duty for Training assignments last 140 days or longer and Active Duty for Other than Training assignments last 181 days or longer. The changes in eligibility for reimbursement discussed below can affect the amounts of reservists’ unreimbursed expenses: Per diem: Reservists on training or other assignments that are treated as a Permanent Change of Station are not eligible for reimbursement of per diem expenses, including for temporary lodging and meals. Reservists are unlikely to relocate their civilian homes for such long-duration, though interim, training and assignments. They may therefore incur expenses typically associated with a Temporary Duty assignment, such as temporary lodging expenses, but for which they cannot be reimbursed. Basic Allowance for Housing: Reservists on training or other assignments that are treated as a Permanent Change of Station receive an adjusted Basic Allowance for Housing based on the location of their new duty station. This adjusted housing allowance applies regardless of whether a reservist actually moves his or her civilian home and family to the new duty station. Depending on the new duty location, a reservist may receive Basic Allowance for Housing at a higher or lower rate than the allowance amount based on the location of their civilian home. If a reservist were in Temporary Duty status—training for 139 days or fewer, or an assignment for 180 days or fewer—he or she would continue to receive Basic Allowance for Housing based on the cost of maintaining his or her civilian home. If reservists decide not to relocate themselves and their families to the location of the long-duration training or assignment, reservists may face unreimbursed costs for maintaining two homes. Once a Permanent Change of Station has been triggered, a reservist is no longer in a Temporary Duty status and may no longer receive per diem for temporary lodging. Reservists must either (1) move to government lodging and forego any Basic Allowance for Housing, or (2) receive Basic Allowance for Housing based on the location of the assignment, which may be higher or lower than the allowance based on the location of their home of record, generally their civilian home. In the first situation, reservists must maintain their civilian home without payment of a Basic Allowance for Housing, and thus may face unreimbursed costs associated with the home’s maintenance. In the second situation, reservists must maintain both their civilian home and a new home with a Basic Allowance for Housing adjusted for the location of the home at the new duty station. Unreimbursed costs may result if the Basic Allowance for Housing adjusted for the location of the new duty station is significantly lower than the housing costs in the area of the reservist’s civilian home. As shown in the 2017 illustrative example in figure 1, reservists receive different levels of payment for the temporary lodging allowance and the Basic Allowance for Housing based on the duration of their Active Duty for Training assignments. A service Secretary may grant a waiver for individuals attending a training course to maintain Temporary Duty status beyond the 140-day time limit, which normally would require a Permanent Change of Station. However, such waivers apply to all course attendees, whether they are members of the active or reserve components. DOD maintains data on the number of these waivers, but not for the discrete number of waivers for reserve component training. Individual reservists can also apply for a waiver for the rate of their Basic Allowance for Housing payment to be based on the location of their dependents, effectively allowing payment at the geographic rate of a reservist’s civilian home. However, this option is not available to reservists without dependents. Within the last decade, DOD and the services have conducted a few limited assessments of the potential effect of unreimbursed out-of-pocket travel expenses incurred by reservists to perform required training and other reserve activities on retention of reservists. Although various entities have raised concerns regarding reservists’ out-of-pocket travel expenses, the available information is either anecdotal or applicable to only one reserve component or one aspect of travel policy. DOD reports have noted that such unreimbursed travel expenses, among other factors, may be a challenge for reservists and may therefore affect retention. For example, in 2008, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves reported that travel requirements and associated costs had a negative effect on DOD’s ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, particularly for leadership positions. In addition, in minutes of its meetings, the Air Reserve Forces Policy Committee has called for changes to the Permanent Change of Station requirement for long- duration training, noting in 2015 that it, “frequently creates financial hardship for RC Airmen who typically maintain a residence near their assigned unit or civilian employer.” Three DOD studies have explored potential links between reservists’ unreimbursed travel expenses and retention: A 2012 survey commissioned by the Army Reserve of a small sample of reservist officers potentially eligible for battalion command positions reported that unreimbursed travel costs were among several factors that could influence their decision to apply for these positions. A 2014 study commissioned by the Marine Corps found that, based on a statistical model of a sample of Marines eligible to participate in its Inactive Duty Training travel reimbursement program between May 2012 and September 2013, the program had increased the Marine Corps’ ability to fill critical positions. The study also included an assessment of the cost of increasing the level of reimbursement for Inactive Duty Training and its possible effect on staffing. A 2016 survey commissioned by the Army Reserve, drawn from a non-generalizable sample of a few thousand reservists, reported that a significant majority of respondents in 2015 viewed the Inactive Duty Training travel reimbursement program as an incentive for soldier retention. In addition, during our review, officials from most of the reserve components told us that despite the establishment of the reimbursement program for travel costs associated with Inactive Duty Training, such expenses continue to be a challenge for some reservists. In particular, officials noted that this especially affects personnel who do not qualify for reimbursement. One official noted that, in extreme cases, reservists may find that the cost to attend Inactive Duty Training may exceed drill pay, effectively requiring them to pay out-of-pocket to perform military service. While these reports and studies have alerted DOD to a potential problem, DOD has not yet assessed the effect of unreimbursed travel expenses on retention of reservists in a comprehensive manner and the related overall cost to the federal government. For example, DOD has not yet systematically collected data and assessed the potential effect of current travel reimbursement policy on retention across all services, as measured by outcomes such as fill rates for critical positions and other metrics, or collected more basic information such as the number of reservists who do not move their home during long-duration training, the distances traveled for Inactive Duty Training, and the amount of unreimbursed expenses incurred by reservists. The 2014 Marine Corps’ study on Inactive Duty Training reimbursement did explore fill rates for its potential effect on critical positions. However, its findings are not necessarily applicable to the other reserve components. In addition, DOD has not conducted an assessment on the issue of Permanent Change of Station rules for long- duration training or other assignments. While travel policy officials noted that there is no requirement for such an assessment, some agreed that more robust information would allow for a better understanding of the situation as well as any potential changes that are necessary in DOD’s travel policy. One travel official stated that until a direct connection between unreimbursed travel expenses and retention or related areas is observed within their component, change is unnecessary. As of July 2017, DOD and the reserve components were considering changes to reserve travel policy to mitigate the effect of out-of-pocket expenses on reservists. Specifically, these changes include (1) requesting that Congress increase reimbursement for Inactive Duty Training travel expenses from $300 to $500 and (2) increasing the length of time of Temporary Duty travel for training courses or other assignments before such travel is considered a Permanent Change of Station. The Marine Corps Reserve has developed a draft proposal for congressional consideration for an increase in Inactive Duty Training reimbursement, which an official stated was necessary to address the challenge of filling critical occupations. The Military Advisory Panel, which advises on defense travel issues, has considered an increase in the length of time of Temporary Duty travel for training courses or other assignments before a Permanent Change of Station would be required, but no specific proposals have been developed. Federal internal control standards state that management requires quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate an entity’s performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risk. They further require that management identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. However, without collecting more comprehensive information on the potential effect of the current travel policy on the retention of reservists, DOD would be considering alternative proposals with only the limited data and analysis available to date. Further, the lack of comprehensive data and analysis on the influence of current travel policies will limit DOD’s ability to reach an analytically based decision which weighs the costs and benefits of any potential changes. In deciding to continue or change current travel policies relating to travel reimbursement without the benefit of quality information, DOD risks not managing the potential influence of these policies on reservists’ retention or agency expenditures. Reservists often maintain civilian careers and homes that in some cases can require them to travel long distances to perform their part-time military service. In some instances, such as when performing Inactive Duty Training and long-duration Active Duty for Training or other active duty assignments, such service can result in expenses that cannot be reimbursed to the reservist under DOD’s travel policy. Despite long- standing concerns that out-of-pocket travel expenses reservists incur to perform their service may be increasing, DOD does not have sufficient data and analysis on how reservists’ incurring these expenses could negatively affect DOD’s ability to achieve its mission, the overall costs and benefits of DOD’s travel policy, and how various proposed changes to the travel policy could potentially mitigate any of its possible negative effects. As a result, DOD is not well positioned to move forward with possible changes to travel policy absent further analysis. We recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness collect quality information and conduct an analysis of the potential effects of unreimbursed travel expenses incurred by reservists to perform military service on DOD’s ability to retain reservists in the force, and respond to these risks by considering the costs and benefits of any possible actions to address the identified issues. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix II, DOD concurred with our recommendation. We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Secretaries of the military departments, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (213) 830-1011 or vonaha@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. To determine DOD’s travel costs for the reserve components, we obtained and reviewed fiscal year 2015 execution cost data, the most recent complete data available, that each reserve component reported on travel costs for training and other activities. These costs are reported in a travel cost exhibit included in each component’s annual Reserve Personnel budget justification document. We did not include any travel costs not included in the reserve components’ Reserve Personnel accounts, such as any travel costs in the components’ respective Operations and Maintenance accounts. We did not include travel costs for the Active Guard and Reserve because individuals serving these components are responsible for the full-time administration of the reserve components and differ significantly from part-time drilling reservists in their responsibilities and associated travel. We also did not include costs for the Individual Ready Reserve because these reservists have different training patterns than other reservists. In table 2, we summarize the costs reported by DOD’s six reserve components for Annual Training, Inactive Duty Training, and all other travel costs for fiscal year 2015 by component. In addition to the contact named above, Margaret Best (Assistant Director), Patricia Donahue, Mae Jones, Linda Keefer, Felicia Lopez, Carol Petersen, and Adam Smith made major contributions to this report.", "answers": ["About 91 percent of DOD's 811,000 reservists are part-time, performing military service in addition to civilian employment and careers. These reservists may have to travel to perform required military training or other duties. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 contains a provision for GAO to review the cost of travel for members of the reserve components. This report (1) describes the conditions under which reservists may incur unreimbursed out-of-pocket travel expenses in connection with their service, and (2) addresses the extent to which DOD has assessed the effect of reservists' unreimbursed out-of-pocket travel expenses on retention. GAO reviewed DOD's Joint Travel Regulations and interviewed officials to determine conditions under which reservists might incur unreimbursed travel expenses. It also compared DOD's efforts to analyze the effect of such expenses with federal internal control standards, which state that management requires quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate an entity's performance in achieving key objectives. Reservists may incur unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses under certain conditions in connection with their service. Although the Department of Defense's (DOD) six reserve components reported paying or reimbursing $925 million in travel costs for reservists in fiscal year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, reservists may still incur various expenses that are not reimbursable under DOD's travel regulations. Officials responsible for travel regulations told us that unreimbursed travel expenses for reservists generally arise because it is DOD's policy to: (1) not provide reimbursement, except in limited circumstances, for the cost of travel to attend Inactive Duty Training (i.e., the “1 weekend a month” training commitment for reservists) and (2) consider longer duration training or assignments as a Permanent Change of Station—a change in reservists' home of record—and not as temporary travel. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2008 established a reimbursement program for Inactive Duty Training travel costs, but reservists must meet certain eligibility criteria, such as serving in a critical occupation, and not all service Secretaries have chosen to participate. Under the program, reimbursement is limited to $300 for each roundtrip to the training location. Further, DOD's policy to consider longer duration training or assignments as a Permanent Change of Station may also result in unreimbursed expenses. Specifically, according to DOD officials, reservists may have to maintain two households if, because of their part-time status, they decide not to move themselves and their families to the location of Active Duty Training for 140 days or longer, or of other active duty assignments for 181 days or longer. DOD and the services have conducted a few limited assessments of the potential effect of reservists' unreimbursed travel expenses on the retention of reservists. However, several DOD reports and studies and officials whom GAO interviewed have expressed concern that such unreimbursed expenses may, among other factors, be a challenge for reservists and may therefore negatively affect retention. For example, a 2012 survey commissioned by the Army Reserve of a small sample of reservist officers potentially eligible for battalion command positions reported that unreimbursed travel costs were among several factors that could influence their decision to apply for these positions. DOD and the reserve components are considering changes to reserve travel policy to mitigate the effect of unreimbursed expenses on reservists, by, for example, increasing the $300 limit for Inactive Duty Training reimbursement. However, without the benefit of quality information, DOD risks not managing the potential influence of these policies on reservists' retention or agency expenditures. GAO is recommending that DOD collect quality information and conduct an analysis of the potential effects of reservists' unreimbursed travel expenses on retention, and respond to these risks by considering the costs and benefits of any possible actions to address the identified issues. DOD concurred with this recommendation."], "length": 4527, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2fdfe61259a94b407ba903d149468c6fdb41942bfaec19d6"}
{"input": "", "context": "The Kissell Amendment applies to contracts entered into by DHS as of August 16, 2009, and, according to the Congressional Record, would require DHS to purchase uniforms made in the United States. According to the Congressional Record, the amendment was intended to extend some of the provisions found in the Berry Amendment to DHS. The Berry Amendment generally restricts the Department of Defense’s (DOD) procurement of textiles, among other items, to those produced within the United States. Pursuant to the Kissell Amendment, subject to exceptions, funds appropriated, or otherwise available to DHS, may not be used to procure certain textile items directly related to the national security interests of the United States if the item is not grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States. The Kissell Amendment specifies categories and types of textiles including items such as clothing, tents, tarpaulins, covers, and protective equipment, as well as the fibers used for fabrics such as cotton and other natural and synthetic fabrics. We refer to these textile items that are directly related to the national security interests of the United States as “Kissell-covered items.” The Kissell Amendment also has multiple exceptions to the procurement restriction, including: Small Purchases Exception – procurements under the simplified acquisition threshold (currently set at $150,000). Availability Exception – satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity of any Kissell-covered item cannot be procured when needed at U.S. market prices. Procurements Outside the United States – procurements by vessels in foreign waters or emergency procurements outside the United States. De Minimis Exception – DHS may accept delivery of a Kissell-covered item if it contains non-compliant (i.e., foreign) fibers as long as the total value of those fibers does not exceed 10 percent of the total purchase price of the item. In addition to the exceptions noted above, the Kissell Amendment also states that the Amendment shall be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements. As a result, purchases of Kissell-covered items, including uniforms and body armor, by DHS and its components must be procured consistent with U.S. obligations under relevant U.S. trade agreements. These agreements include the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and 14 bilateral or regional free trade agreements (FTAs) with 20 countries. These agreements generally require each party’s goods and services to be given treatment comparable to what is given to domestic goods and services in certain government procurements. The United States implements these obligations through the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA) and subpart 25.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). According to DHS and its components, officials apply the Kissell Amendment by following the TAA as implemented in FAR subpart 25.4. As a result, when an international trade agreement applies to a DHS procurement of a Kissell-covered item, the Kissell Amendment does not restrict DHS’s purchasing of textile items from that foreign source, regardless of the item’s relationship to the national security interests of the United States. The Buy American Act (BAA) can also apply to DHS procurements. The BAA restricts the U.S. government from purchasing nondomestic end products, unless an exception applies. Examples of exceptions include: Where the cost of the domestic end product would be unreasonable. Where sufficient commercial quantities of domestic end products of a satisfactory quality are not reasonably available. In acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA or FTAs, USTR has waived the Buy American statute and other discriminatory provisions for eligible products. The BAA could apply to procurements of certain textile items valued below the $150,000 simplified acquisition threshold, to which the Kissell Amendment does not apply. The applicability of the act to a particular procurement depends on a number of factors such as the existence of a waiver or whether an exception applies. DHS and its components procure textiles and fabrics for numerous purposes, including clothing and equipping its officers and employees. From October 2009 through June 2017, of DHS’s more than $105 billion in obligations for procurements, $774 million, or less than one percent, was for textile products, according to FPDS-NG. The majority of textiles and fabrics procured by DHS components are for uniforms and body armor. In particular, of the $774 million, DHS obligated $516 million (or 67 percent) to procure uniforms and body armor for DHS personnel (see fig. 1). In August 2009, DHS updated its procurement regulations, the HSAR, to incorporate the Kissell Amendment restriction on the procurement of textiles from foreign sources; since then DHS inserted language incorporating the restriction into the 11 uniform and body armor contracts we reviewed. The HSAR establishes standardized DHS policies for all procurement activities within the department; according to DHS officials, all DHS components are to follow these policies. Pursuant to the Kissell Amendment, the restriction on the procurement of textiles became effective for DHS on August 16, 2009. One day later, DHS published an interim rule with a request for comments from the public that amended relevant HSAR sections to reflect the statutory change limiting the procurement of products containing textiles from sources outside the United States (i.e., the Kissell Amendment). On June 9, 2010, after receiving comments from the public, DHS adopted the amendments issued under the interim rule as final and without change. The amended sections detail the restriction on procurements of foreign textiles. They also provide a list of the types of textile items included in the restriction (i.e., yarn, wool, cotton), the exceptions noted in the Kissell Amendment, and provide detail on the specific application of trade agreements. Under the regulations, unless an exception applies, a specific clause shall be inserted in solicitations and contract actions detailing the requirement to use domestic goods for any procurement of a Kissell-covered item. Some components within DHS issued additional, supplemental guidance to the HSAR, while other components determined that additional guidance would be duplicative, according to officials. For example, Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) Internal Guidance and Procedure Memorandum, updated in June 2016, provides additional guidance to contracting officers at TSA on the procurement of textiles. This guidance specifically states that for certain textile products, TSA’s contracting officers can only evaluate and/or accept offers from specified countries. Other components determined that additional guidance was not needed because the HSAR adequately covers the requirements of the Kissell Amendment for their purposes. For example, U.S. Secret Service officials stated that, for any procurement of textiles, they insert the required language from the HSAR into the request for proposals in case an item could be considered directly related to U.S. national security interests and thereby subject to the Kissell Amendment restriction. DHS officials stated that contracts for the procurement of uniforms and body armor are their only contracts for textile-related products that are directly related to national security interests. See figure 2 for examples of DHS uniforms and body armor. According to DHS officials, other textile or apparel procurements, such as curtains for DHS offices, would likely not be subject to the foreign procurement restriction under the Kissell Amendment because they are not directly related to national security interests. DHS components can also procure textiles through the Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) program. When ordering from these contracts, DHS contracting officers would make the determination of whether or not the purchase is directly related to national security interests and therefore subject to the Kissell Amendment restriction, according to DHS officials. DHS officials also explained that if the purchase under the FSS program contract is subject to the Kissell Amendment, the contracting officer would be responsible for inserting the required language from the HSAR into the delivery order. All 11 of the contracts we reviewed for uniforms and body armor entered into by a DHS component since August 2009 included language regarding the restriction of the Kissell Amendment. Many of DHS’s components that buy uniforms, including TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), were already under contract with a vendor to supply uniforms when the Kissell Amendment took effect in August 2009. The Kissell Amendment specified that it applied to contracts entered into by DHS 180 days after the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Therefore, DHS and its components did not apply the Kissell restriction to contracts signed before August 16, 2009. Several components separately signed contracts with uniform vendors after prior contracts expired and the Kissell restriction was in effect. For example, in February 2010, TSA signed a contract for uniforms with a vendor that included language restricting the foreign procurement of those uniforms per the Kissell Amendment. In 2012, DHS decided to enter into a single, department-wide contract for the procurement of uniforms for all of its components. While that contract was being developed, several components signed additional contracts for uniforms with vendors to ensure a continuous supply of uniform items for their officers. This included a “bridge” contract between TSA and a vendor in February 2013, which also included language referencing the Kissell Amendment and language restricting the foreign procurement of those uniforms. In September 2014, DHS entered into its current 5-year, department-wide uniforms contract that provides eight DHS components with uniform clothing items. One vendor holds this uniforms contract. DHS employs multiple procedures, according to officials, in an effort to ensure that the restriction on the procurement of foreign textiles from the Kissell Amendment was and is properly applied, including (1) a standardized procurement contract review process; (2) a requirement for all DHS components to use established department-wide contracts; (3) verification procedures to ensure the stated country of origin is correct; and (4) trainings on foreign procurement restrictions. First, the DHS official review process for all procurements helps ensure that the Kissell restriction is applied, if appropriate, to contracts for textiles and apparel, according to officials. Specifically, each procurement goes through a standardized review process that includes several levels of acquisition supervisors and DHS legal counsel, depending on the estimated dollar amount of the procurement. The DHS Acquisition Manual requires this review and approval process, which is designed to ensure compliance with all relevant federal acquisition laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. Through this process, officials evaluate the proposed contract for a number of restrictions, such as the appropriate use of a small business set-aside or a sole-source contract, which must also be reviewed by supervisors and legal departments before contract approval. According to DHS officials, while the applicability of the Kissell Amendment is part of the standard review process, there is no separate review for whether the foreign procurement restriction should be applied to the procurement. Officials also stated that the small number of contracting officers handling these textile procurements are aware of the requirements. Second, DHS now uses department-wide contracts for uniforms and body armor rather than each component entering into its own contracts for those items. Establishing and using these department-wide contracts increases efficiencies and reduces duplication in the department’s procurement processes, according to DHS documentation. According to agency officials, the establishment of a department-wide uniforms contract for use by all DHS components reduces opportunities for mistakes, including the possibility of a contracting officer issuing a contract that does not include the required restriction for a Kissell-covered item. Third, the department relies on the vendor to verify that the item is in compliance with all applicable restrictions. It is not the responsibility of the agency or department to verify the country of origin of an item procured through a contract. According to the FAR, the contracting officer may rely on the vendor’s certification of the country of origin for an end product when evaluating a foreign offer. DHS officials told us that, for each contract, the vendor is responsible for certifying the country of origin and notifying DHS if a uniform item from a previously approved country is no longer available and a replacement must be located. According to representatives from the current uniforms vendor, both its manufacturing facilities and its subcontractors have measures and internal controls in place to ensure that all items under the current uniforms contract are sourced from designated countries. Furthermore, if an item is being misrepresented, or not from the reported country of origin, other vendors in the industry could report such suspected violations to DHS and the department would investigate possible false claims. According to DHS officials, no reports have been made against the vendor for the current uniforms contract. In addition, CBP’s Textiles and Trade Agreements Division is responsible for the Textile Production Verification Team Program. Under this program, CBP deploys teams of personnel drawn from many DHS components to FTA partner countries to visit manufacturers of textiles imported into the United States. These teams review textile production and verify compliance with the terms of the FTA. CBP provided information that showed it had made numerous verification visits to factories used by DHS’s uniform vendor since October 2011. However, CBP officials said they did not know the degree to which the vendor’s imports from these factories were used to fulfill the DHS uniform contract. Fourth, DHS provided training in 2009 and in 2017 to contracting personnel who conduct textile and apparel procurements subject to the Kissell Amendment and other Buy American-like provisions to ensure that the requirements are applied appropriately. The Kissell Amendment required that the Secretary of DHS ensure that each member of DHS’s acquisition workforce “who participates personally and substantially in the acquisition of textiles on a regular basis receives training during fiscal year 2009 on the requirements” of the Kissell Amendment and the regulations implementing the amendment. The amendment further states that any training program developed after August 2009 include comprehensive information on the Kissell Amendment restriction. According to officials, appropriate DHS contracting personnel were trained on the requirements of the Kissell Amendment through a presentation to DHS’s Acquisition Policy Board in July 2009. DHS officials, however, were unable to identify the number of personnel present during this meeting or the materials associated with this training. According to DHS officials, no further training on Kissell requirements was conducted until June and July 2017, when DHS officials conducted two webinars that included approximately 570 DHS acquisition professionals on the requirements of the Kissell Amendment and its implications under the President’s Buy American and Hire American Executive Order from April 2017. Our review on the implementation of the Kissell Amendment, as well as the President’s new actions to increase opportunities for government agencies to buy American and hire American, precipitated the trainings, stated DHS officials. We observed the July 2017 training, at the invitation of DHS, and confirmed that the materials and topics covered included Kissell Amendment requirements. In practice, the Kissell Amendment affects DHS textile purchases in a limited manner due to multiple factors. For most DHS components, these factors limit the effect of the Kissell Amendment restriction to certain foreign textile procurements directly related to U.S. national security interests that fall between $150,000 and $191,000. Specifically, from October 2009 to June 2017, only 14 DHS-awarded textile contracts, excluding TSA, fell within this range, according to FPDS-NG data. TSA textile procurements, unlike most DHS components, are excluded from the coverage of most U.S. international agreements. Therefore, the Kissell Amendment restricts TSA’s procurement of certain foreign textiles above $150,000 from all but three foreign countries. According to DHS officials, the current contracts to which the Kissell Amendment applies are department-wide contracts for uniforms and body armor. As of June 2017, under the current uniforms contract, 58 percent of the value of ordered uniform items by DHS came from foreign sources. In addition, DHS officials stated that the current body armor contracts source all textile items from the United States. The number of DHS’s textile procurements that could be affected by the Kissell Amendment restriction is limited by multiple factors. The Kissell Amendment restriction applies only to those textile items that are directly related to national security interests for procurements above the $150,000 simplified acquisition threshold, and must be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements. In practice, this limits the number of procurements that could be affected by the amendment’s restriction to those of Kissell-covered items between the current simplified acquisition threshold and the current WTO GPA threshold of $191,000, a $41,000 range, for most DHS components. Furthermore, statutory and regulatory provisions generally require that government agencies acquire U.S.-made or designated country end products and services for procurements covered by the WTO GPA. For most of DHS, the procurement of certain textiles is covered by the WTO GPA. Therefore, due to these regulations, most DHS components are limited in their textile procurements at or above $191,000 to the United States or designated countries, regardless of the Kissell Amendment. However, the number of TSA contracts that could be affected by the Kissell Amendment restriction is potentially greater since procurement of textiles by TSA is not subject to statutory and regulatory provisions that affect the rest of DHS’s procurement of textiles. U.S. obligations under international agreements, as implemented by the TAA and FAR, require that offers of eligible products receive equal consideration with domestic offers. The FAR additionally specifies that agencies, “in acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, acquire only U.S.- made or designated country end products unless offers for such end products are either not received or are insufficient to fulfill the requirements.” To be a U.S. procurement covered by the WTO GPA, the procurement must (1) be performed by a covered government entity; (2) be for a covered item; and (3) be at or above the WTO GPA threshold, which is currently $191,000. Other international trade agreements have their own thresholds currently ranging from $25,000 to $191,000. Figure 3 outlines the various key procurement thresholds that may affect the designated and non-designated countries from which DHS could source textiles with respect to the Kissell Amendment. Most of these dollar thresholds are subject to revision approximately every 2 years. Due to the multiple factors that affect DHS’s textile procurements, most of DHS’s components may source eligible textiles from up to 128 designated countries outside the United States in procurements at or above $191,000 (see fig. 4). This is because most DHS components’ textile procurements are considered covered items under the WTO GPA. Therefore, most DHS components’ foreign textile procurements that either meet or exceed the current $191,000 threshold are restricted to designated countries regardless of the Kissell Amendment, due to the FAR. These designated countries include WTO GPA countries, Free Trade Agreement countries, least developed countries, and Caribbean Basin countries. As noted above, multiple factors influence DHS’s procurement of textiles and the number of contracts that could be affected by the Kissell Amendment restriction. Based on our analysis of contract data from FPDS-NG, from October 2009 to June 2017, DHS awarded 111 textile contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold. Of the 111 contracts, only 14 DHS textile contracts, excluding TSA, were valued between the simplified acquisition threshold and $191,000, the current threshold for coverage under the WTO GPA. In part, because FPDS-NG does not designate whether or not a contract is directly related to the national security interests of the United States, we could not determine whether these contracts were subject to the provisions of the Kissell Amendment. According to DHS officials, the only current contracts considered directly related to U.S. national security and therefore subject to the Kissell Amendment are for uniforms and body armor. The Kissell Amendment includes additional language regarding the use of any availability exception and states that any availability exception issued by DHS shall be publically posted on a government procurement internet site within 7 days of the contract. However, according to agency officials, since the passage of the Kissell Amendment, DHS has not issued any waivers for availability exceptions and has therefore been limited to procuring certain textile items from the United States and designated countries identified in the FAR. The Kissell Amendment restriction affects TSA textile procurements differently than other DHS components. As implemented, the Kissell Amendment restricts TSA’s procurement of certain textiles above $150,000 to the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Chile. TSA’s procurement of textiles is different because it is not included in the U.S. coverage schedules of the WTO GPA and all U.S. free trade agreements, with the exception of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement. According to USTR officials, some of TSA’s security functions were originally held by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is not subject to the FAR. Furthermore, TSA was also not subject to the FAR prior to 2008, until Congress passed legislation removing the requirement that TSA procurements be subject to the acquisition management system established by the administrator of the FAA. Those circumstances resulted in TSA’s exclusion from the WTO GPA for textiles and most other international trade agreements, according to USTR officials. Figure 5 illustrates when the Kissell Amendment could affect TSA procurements and the applicability of international trade agreements. Based on our analysis of FPDS-NG data, from October 2009 to June 2017, TSA entered into 13 textile contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold. From October 2014 to June 2017, 58 percent of the value of uniform items ordered by DHS came from outside the United States. In September 2014, DHS entered into its current department-wide uniforms contract, the largest value textile contract since the passage of the Kissell Amendment in 2009. In the request for proposals, DHS included a clause detailing the Kissell restriction on the purchase of foreign items in the uniforms contract documentation. As implemented, when combined with the purchasing restriction in the TAA, the clause in the Kissell Amendment that states the act shall be applied consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements allows the uniforms contract vendor to source items from up to 128 designated countries. In the request for proposal for the current uniforms contract, DHS components included a list of over 900 uniform items including shirts, pants, shoes, and insignias. The vendor that was awarded the contract then reported the cost and expected country of origin for each item, which DHS approved. Table 1 shows the estimated cost and quantity of items estimated to be procured under the contract for components that primarily have a national security function. After the uniform contract was entered into by DHS in September 2014, DHS components began ordering uniform items under the contract. In addition to more than 900 types of uniform items that were agreed upon at the initiation of the contract, DHS components issued contract modifications to add or remove uniform items from the approved list. Common types of items expected to be ordered included uniform shirts, pants, socks, and shoes that met DHS component specifications. From October 2014 to June 2017, $164.6 million in uniform items was ordered by DHS components that primarily have a national security function. Of that amount, 58 percent, or $96 million, in uniform items ordered by DHS came from a reported 12 countries outside the United States. The remaining 42 percent, or $69 million, in uniform items was reported as originating in the United States. By value, Mexico, the largest source of uniform items from outside of the United States, accounted for 30 percent of the ordered uniform items. In addition, 8 percent of the value of uniform items was sourced from least developed countries, including Cambodia (5 percent) and Bangladesh (2 percent). Figure 6 illustrates the percentage value of DHS procurement of uniform items by reported country of origin for the current contract by components that primarily have a national security function. Based on our analysis of the vendor’s ordering data, the majority of the value of uniform items ordered by all five components were sourced from outside the United States. In addition, a larger value of the uniform items ordered by three of the five components were sourced from Mexico than from any other country, including the United States. Table 2 shows the total value of the uniform ordering data for the five DHS components that primarily have a national security function under the current uniforms contract. From October 2014 through June 2017, CBP ordered approximately $101.1 million in uniform items under the contract, and TSA ordered approximately $53.5 million. CBP and TSA accounted for the majority of the dollar value of uniform orders from October 2014 through June 2017, representing 94 percent of the value of uniform items ordered by DHS components that primarily have a national security function under the contract. Specifically, 32 percent of the value of TSA ordered uniform items were from the United States, with the other 68 percent sourced from Mexico. As mentioned above, the Kissell Amendment, as implemented, restricts TSA’s foreign procurement of certain textiles above $150,000 to Canada, Mexico, and Chile. According to DHS officials and representatives of the current uniforms vendor, both the price of the uniform items and the time it would take to find appropriate U.S. sources could potentially increase if current statutory and trade agreements requirements changed and DHS was required to source all of its uniform items from the United States. According to the FAR, it is the responsibility of agencies to obtain the best value for the U.S. government. According to DHS officials, the best value may be sourced from foreign countries, especially when the country is a party to an international trade agreement with the United States. DHS officials and representatives of the vendor stated that it would be possible to source most of the items in the current uniforms contract from the United States. However, representatives of the vendor speculated that sourcing only from the United States could result in a 50 to 150 percent price increase for items that are currently sourced from foreign countries. Therefore, DHS costs could increase for over half of the uniform items currently procured from foreign sources. Additionally, DHS officials stated that the domestic availability of some items, such as footwear, is limited and that it could take approximately 2 years to find U.S. suppliers for all items currently procured from foreign sources. The second largest current textile contract is the department-wide contract for body armor. Effective November 1, 2016, the department- wide contract for body armor is not to exceed $93.8 million. As of June 2017, DHS had obligated $6.8 million under these body armor contracts. DHS did not provide GAO documentary evidence that the body armor is produced in the United States. However, according to DHS officials, textile items under the current body armor contracts are produced in the United States. According to DHS officials, to verify that materials are produced in the United States, DHS visited the site where these materials are produced and assembled in the United States. In addition, the contract contains specific language restricting the vendor from procuring items that are not in compliance with the Kissell Amendment. We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to DHS and USTR. DHS did not provide written comments on the draft report but provided a number of technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate. USTR did not provide written or technical comments to the draft report. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the U.S. Trade Representative, and other interested parties.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. A Senate Report accompanying Senate Bill 1619, a bill related to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, includes a provision for us to review the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) implementation and compliance with the Kissell Amendment, as well as the effectiveness of the policy. This report examines the extent to which (1) DHS has incorporated the Kissell Amendment into its procurement policies and procedures and (2) the Kissell Amendment affects DHS’s procurement of textiles. To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws and policies, such as Section 604 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Kissell Amendment”), the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA) as amended, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), and the DHS Acquisition Manual, as well as select U.S. free trade agreements. We interviewed officials from DHS and the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). We also interviewed officials from the U.S. textile and apparel industry, including the National Council of Textile Organizations and the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Finally, we spoke with officials from the vendor for DHS’s current department-wide uniforms contract, VF Imagewear. To determine the extent to which DHS incorporated the Kissell Amendment into its procurement policies and procedures, we reviewed relevant DHS documents and policies, including the HSAR, interim and final rules on the implementation of the Kissell Amendment, and component-level procurement guidance. We also interviewed officials from DHS’s Office of the Chief Procurement Officer and from the components in DHS that have their own contracting authority, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Secret Service. To analyze whether or not language indicating the restriction on the procurement of foreign textiles from the Kissell Amendment was included in DHS and component level contracts, we reviewed contract files for 11 available uniforms and body armor contracts entered into since August 16, 2009, the date the Kissell Amendment became effective. We reviewed contract files from DHS uniform and body armor contracts because these are the only DHS textile contracts that are directly related to U.S. national security and therefore subject to the Kissell Amendment, according to DHS officials. We identified these uniforms and body armor contracts through reviews of Federal Procurement Data System–Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data for DHS and components contracts in groups 83 and 84 since August 16, 2009, and through discussions with CBP, DHS, and TSA officials. We were not, however, able to review every uniforms contract all DHS components have entered into since August 16, 2009, because, for example, some of the contract files were no longer available, consistent with federal document retention policies, according to DHS officials. The results of our reviews of selected contracts are not generalizable to all DHS textile contracts entered into since August 16, 2009. To determine the extent to which the Kissell Amendment affects DHS’s procurement of textiles, we reviewed relevant government regulations and laws, U.S. international agreements, DHS contract files, and ordering data for the largest textile contract since the effective date of the Kissell Amendment. We reviewed the FAR to evaluate which international agreements are applicable to DHS textile procurements, the thresholds for each international trade agreement, and the countries from which DHS may procure certain textiles. We reviewed the U.S. central government coverage schedule of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) to determine which procurements by DHS component are covered by the WTO GPA and therefore subject to the purchasing restriction in the TAA, as implemented in the FAR. To identify the dollar range for textile contracts that could be affected by the Kissell Amendment, we reviewed the Kissell Amendment and the relevant provisions of the FAR. We also interviewed USTR officials and DHS officials from the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, CBP, and TSA to understand how international trade agreements affect DHS’s textile procurement under the Kissell Amendment. We reviewed award and obligation data from the FPDS-NG to identify the number of textile contracts awarded by DHS components and delivery orders through the General Services Administration’s Federal Supply Schedules program above the simplified acquisition threshold and those that could be affected by the Kissell Amendment. To assess the reliability of procurement data from FPDS-NG, we reviewed relevant documentation and performed verification through electronic testing. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To evaluate DHS’s procurement of uniform items from the United States versus foreign sources, we reviewed the ordering estimates, which were provided as an attachment to DHS’s request for proposals for the current uniforms contract, and ordering data provided by the vendor for the current uniforms contract. The current uniform and body armor contracts are the only two active contracts to which the Kissell Amendment applies, according to DHS officials. For the purposes of ordering data and estimates, we did not review previous contracts. In addition, since all body armor items are sourced from the United States, we focused our ordering analysis on the current uniforms contract. Because we did not evaluate ordering data for previous DHS uniforms contracts, these values cannot be extrapolated to all DHS uniforms contracts. To calculate the ordering estimates for the current uniforms contract, we analyzed data created by DHS and the uniform vendor during the development phase of the contract. To focus on the DHS components that primarily have a national security function under the current uniforms contract, we analyzed ordering estimates to identify the number of uniform items that DHS components reported as being directly related to national security. Under the current uniforms contract estimates, CBP, ICE, National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), TSA, and U.S. Secret Service are the five DHS components that reported the majority of uniform items as being directly related to national security. As a result, we included these five DHS components in our analysis of the ordering estimates under the current uniforms contract. We did not include FEMA or Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in our analysis because FEMA did not list any uniform items as related to national security and FLETC identified only one item out of 88 as related to national security. We also did not include ordering estimates from the Food and Drug Administration, which is a party to the contract but is not a DHS component. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard did not provide ordering estimates since it was not included in the original proposal for the current uniforms contract. For each of the identified DHS components that reported the majority of uniform items as directly related to national security, we analyzed the estimated data based on description, the estimated quantity, the unit price, and the country of origin. While we did not analyze the value of any contract modifications that added or removed uniform items from the contract, we did review select modifications and found that contract modifications were generally consistent with the original contract estimates for that non-generalizable sample. To obtain insights into the countries of origin in the modifications, we reviewed a small, non- generalizable sample of 10 modifications. We concluded that the breakdown between domestic and foreign sourced items for the items added through the modifications was generally consistent with the breakdown between domestic and foreign sourced items in the original contracts’ estimates. To determine the reasonableness of the processes by which DHS and its vendors generated these estimates, we interviewed knowledgeable officials, reviewed documents submitted by the vendor, and performed data reliability testing. DHS officials told us that they had provided the contractor with detailed lists of the textile items it required, and the vendor reported that they determined the prices and countries of origin based on prevailing market conditions. DHS officials then reviewed the estimates provided by the vendor and approved the items, price, and country of origin under the contract. DHS officials and the vendor informed us that because these estimates reflected market conditions when the contract was signed, actual purchases of items might be from countries other than those listed in the contract, depending on changes in those conditions and availability of the items. We determined these estimates were sufficiently reliable to represent DHS’s intended purchases of textile products by country of origin under this contract. To analyze the orders of uniform items, we relied on ordering data provided by the vendor for the current uniform contract. We reviewed uniform ordering data for the five DHS components that reported the majority of uniform items as being directly related to national security: CBP, ICE, NPPD, TSA, and the U.S. Secret Service. The uniform ordering data included items ordered by individual DHS employees through an allowance system and by DHS components through bulk orders. We did not include the U.S. Coast Guard in our analysis since it primarily orders U.S.-made uniform items through the Department of Defense’s Defense Logistics Agency, according to Coast Guard officials. We analyzed the value of uniform items procured from the United States and foreign sources based on the reported country of origin and component from October 2014 to June 2017. To assess the reliability of the ordering data provided by the vendor, we reviewed the data for inconsistencies. We clarified with the vendor the relevant data sets for our analysis and any discrepancies we identified in the data. DHS relies on the vendor to provide the countries of origin, and it was beyond the scope of this engagement for us to verify the vendor provided country of origin. We determined that the ordering data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of comparing orders to estimates by countries of origin for uniforms under the contract, and presenting details about purchases from the United States versus other countries of origin. The result of our analysis is limited to the current department-wide uniforms contract with DHS and cannot be extrapolated to other DHS textile contracts. For the body armor contracts, we relied on FPDS-NG data for the obligations under the current and previous contracts. We also interviewed DHS officials who identified the country of origin of the items purchased under the current body armor contracts; it was beyond the scope of this engagement to verify the agency-provided country of origin. To assess the reliability of the obligations data from FPDS-NG, we reviewed relevant documentation performed verification through electronic testing. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to November 2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Mulkins (Analyst-in-Charge), Martin Wilson, Lynn Cothern, Martin de Alteriis, Neil Doherty, Grace Lui, and Julia Kennon made key contributions to this report.", "answers": ["The U.S. textile industry sustained significant losses when textile production fell from $71 billion in 2006 to $46 billion in 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. As a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Congress passed the Kissell Amendment, which placed a restriction on DHS's procurement of certain textiles from foreign sources. DHS has applied this restriction to uniforms and body armor. The amendment was intended to increase opportunities for American textile and apparel manufacturers, according to the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The Senate report that accompanied Senate Bill 1619, a bill related to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, includes a provision for GAO to review DHS's implementation of the Kissell Amendment and its effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS has incorporated the Kissell Amendment into its procurement policies and procedures and (2) the Kissell Amendment affects DHS's procurement of textiles. To perform this work, GAO analyzed DHS policies and procedures, procurement obligations data, textile contract files, and vendor ordering data from DHS's current uniforms contract. GAO also interviewed DHS and U.S. Trade Representative officials and private sector representatives, including the vendor for the current DHS uniforms contract. GAO received technical comments from DHS, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has updated its policies and procedures to incorporate a restriction on its procurement of certain textiles as specified in the “Kissell Amendment.” In August 2009, DHS amended its procurement policies to reflect the Kissell Amendment restriction and describe the limitations on DHS's procurement of specified textiles from sources outside the United States. All 11 contracts GAO reviewed for uniforms and body armor entered into by a DHS component since August 2009 included language regarding the Kissell Amendment restriction. In addition, according to officials, DHS has several procedures to ensure that contracting officers adhere to the requirements of the Kissell Amendment. These include a required acquisition review process; a requirement for all DHS components to use department-wide contracts; verification procedures; and training for contracting personnel on the Kissell Amendment restriction. In practice, the Kissell Amendment restriction affects a limited number of procurements due to multiple factors and has not fully restricted DHS from purchasing textiles from foreign sources. The restriction applies only to certain textile purchases directly related to U.S. national security interests above the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000, and must be applied consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements. For most of DHS, this restriction limits only procurements that fall between $150,000 and $191,000, the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement threshold. However, because procurements by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of textiles are excluded from most international agreements, the Kissell Amendment prevents TSA's purchasing of certain textiles above $150,000 from all but three foreign countries. In September 2014, DHS signed a uniforms contract, the largest procurement covered by the Kissell Amendment. Under this contract, DHS has ordered 58 percent of the $164.6 million in uniform items from foreign sources through June 2017 (see figure)."], "length": 6930, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7b837a8611cd287fac63a3c99bf14a30846c2b43cdc89b7a"}
{"input": "", "context": "In 2017, about 2,250 general acute care hospitals in the United States were located in areas that met FORHP’s definition of rural; these rural hospitals represented approximately 48 percent of hospitals nationwide and 16 percent of inpatient beds. These hospitals were spread across the 84 percent of the United States land area that FORHP classified as rural, and served the 18 percent of the United States population that lived in these areas. While there are significant differences across rural areas and populations, as a whole they differ from their urban counterparts in several ways. For example, rural areas have the following characteristics: Higher percentage of elderly residents. In 2014, 18 percent of the population was aged 65 or older in rural counties, compared with 14 percent in urban counties. Higher percentage of residents with limitations in activities caused by chronic conditions. In 2010-2011, 18 percent of adults in rural counties had limitations in activities caused by chronic health conditions, compared with 13 percent in large, central urban counties. Lower median household income. In 2014, the median household income in rural counties was approximately $44,000, compared to $58,000 in urban counties. Rural areas have also experienced several changes in recent years that have exacerbated these differences. For example, according to research by the United States Department of Agriculture, rural areas have experienced the following changes: Decreasing population. From 2010 through 2015, the population in rural areas declined, on average, by 0.07 percent per year, while the population in urban areas increased, on average, by 0.9 percent per year. Slow employment growth. From 2010 through 2015, rural employment grew at 0.8 percent per year, less than half that of urban areas (1.9 percent per year). Rural hospital closures are not a recent phenomenon. For example, we previously reported that between 1985 and 1988, 140 rural hospitals closed—approximately 5 percent of the rural hospitals in 1985. The large number of closures in the 1980s was preceded by a change in how Medicare paid hospitals. Specifically, in 1983, Medicare’s inpatient prospective payment system was created, whereby predetermined rates were set for each Medicare hospital discharge. The intent was to control Medicare costs by giving hospitals financial incentives to deliver services more efficiently and reduce unnecessary use of inpatient services by paying a hospital a predetermined amount. However, one consequence of the new payment system was that some small, rural hospitals experienced large Medicare losses and increased financial distress. Partially in response to the number of rural hospital closures, FORHP was established in 1987 to, among other things, advise the Secretary of HHS on the effects of current and proposed policies on the financial viability of small rural hospitals and on access to and quality of health care in rural areas; establish and maintain a clearinghouse for information on rural health coordinate rural health activities within HHS; and administer grants and other instruments to fund activities to improve health care in rural areas. HHS officials identified several rural-specific HHS payment policies and programs as providing key financial support to rural hospitals, and in turn, rural residents’ access to hospital services. These key HHS payment policies and programs may be placed into three categories: (1) Medicare rural hospital payment designations; (2) rural grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts, and (3) new approaches in rural health care delivery and payment (see table 1). Medicare rural hospital payment designations. CMS administers five rural hospital payment designations, in which rural or isolated hospitals that meet specified eligibility criteria receive higher reimbursement for hospital services than they otherwise would have received under Medicare’s standard payment methodology. A rural hospital may qualify as a Critical Access Hospital, Sole Community Hospital, or Medicare Dependent Hospital—each of which has different eligibility criteria and payment methodologies. With the exception of Critical Access Hospitals, rural hospitals may also qualify as Low Volume Hospitals and Rural Referral Centers, in which eligible hospitals receive additional payments or exemptions. The largest of the five designations is the Critical Access Hospital program, which represented 56 percent of rural hospitals in 2017 and pays eligible small, rural hospitals based on their reported costs (instead of the standard rates under the inpatient prospective payment system). (See app. I, table 2, for a description of each of the five Medicare rural hospital payment designations.) CMS was unable to provide estimates of the additional Medicare payments rural hospitals received from each designation in 2017. According to CMS officials, CMS generally does not model the amount of additional Medicare payments resulting from rural hospital payment designations, except in years when there is a related payment policy change going through rulemaking. Rural grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. FORHP administers multiple grant programs, cooperative agreements, and contracts that provide funding and technical assistance to rural hospitals. The largest of these is the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility grant program, in which FORHP provides funds to states to support Critical Access Hospitals to stabilize their finances, foster innovative models of care, and support other improvement activities. In 2017, 45 states received $25 million in Flex grants. FORHP officials noted that they can provide information to help states determine how to best target Flex grant funds, as there is not enough funding to financially assist all Critical Access Hospitals that are at risk of closing. (See app. I, table 3, for a description of the rural grants, and cooperative agreements and contracts identified by HHS officials.) New approaches in rural health care delivery and payment. CMS’s Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) tests new ways to deliver and pay for health care—including some focused on rural areas—with the goal of reducing spending and preserving or enhancing the quality of care for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. As of June 2018, the largest of these rural models and demonstrations was Medicare’s Accountable Care Organization Investment Model. Groups of providers in rural and underserved areas participating in this model, potentially including small hospitals, agree to be held accountable for the cost and quality of care to their Medicare patients. The model tests providing pre-paid shared savings as an incentive for providers in rural and underserved areas to form Accountable Care Organizations and for these organizations to transition to arrangements with greater accountability for financial performance. For fiscal years 2012 through 2018, $96 million had been obligated to organizations participating in the model. Forty-five Accountable Care Organizations were participating in this model as of 2018. (See app. I, table 4, for a description of the new approaches in rural health care delivery and payment identified by HHS officials.) In addition to the HHS payment policies and programs specifically targeting rural areas, HHS officials also identified broader payment policies and programs that they stated can provide key support to rural hospitals and rural residents’ access to hospital services. These HHS payment policies and programs may be placed in four categories: Medicare and Medicaid base payments. These consist of the standard payments for hospitals services. Medicare and Medicaid uncompensated care payments. Both Medicare and Medicaid provide multiple types of additional payments to support hospitals that incur costs for services provided to uninsured and other low-income individuals for which the hospitals are not fully compensated. Medicare also provides bad debt payments to hospitals to reimburse them for a portion of Medicare’s beneficiaries’ unpaid deductibles and coinsurance, as long as the hospital makes a reasonable effort to collect the unpaid amounts. Other targeted HHS payment policies and programs. HHS administers other targeted payment policies and programs that support specific types of providers and areas, including, but not limited to, rural hospitals and areas. In particular, the Health Resources & Services Administration, an HHS agency, administers a drug discount program targeted at certain hospitals and other safety net providers. In addition, CMS administers bonus payments for certain physician services provided to Medicare beneficiaries in areas with a shortage of health professionals. State Innovation Models Initiative. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation’s State Innovation Models aim to achieve better quality of care, lower costs, and improve health for the population of the participating states or territory. Some states’ plans include testing new delivery and payment models specifically targeting rural areas. HHS monitors rural hospitals’ financial viability and rural residents’ access to hospital services, primarily by funding rural health research centers that track rural hospital closures and study rural residents’ access to hospital services. To monitor rural hospitals’ financial viability, HHS funds and conducts several activities: Tracking rural hospital closures and monitoring profitability. The North Carolina rural health research center, a FORHP-funded rural health research center, tracks rural hospital closures and monitors rural hospitals’ profitability and other financial indicators. North Carolina’s researchers identify rural hospital closures through a multi- party agreement with FORHP, the American Hospital Association, and the National Rural Health Association, each of which alerts the research center once one learns about a closure. Research center staff then confirm the closure and ascertain whether the hospital converted to another facility type by searching the hospital website and calling a community leader, such as the mayor. The North Carolina rural health research center publishes a list of rural hospital closures since 2010 on its website. It also publishes reports on rural hospitals’ profitability, including the extent to which profitability varies by rural hospitals’ characteristics, and how rural hospitals’ profitability compares to the profitability of their urban counterparts. Monitoring Critical Access Hospitals’ financial indicators. The North Carolina rural health research center, through its role as part of the Flex Monitoring Team, develops and monitors various financial indicators for Critical Access Hospitals. Using the hospitals’ Medicare cost reports, the research center currently monitors 22 financial indicators under 6 domains—profitability, liquidity, capital structure, revenue, cost, and utilization. These financial indicator data are available to every Critical Access Hospital through an online tool that also helps those hospitals compare their financial performance to peer hospitals. The Flex Monitoring Team also publishes state-level summary data on Critical Access Hospitals’ finances that are available on its website. HHS also reviews and estimates the financial effect of policy changes on rural hospitals. In particular, FORHP officials review proposed and final rules for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges to identify concerns from a rural health perspective. Drawing on the research it funds, FORHP officials may suggest policy modifications to CMS, such as exempting certain Medicare rural hospital designations from a proposed policy change. In addition to FORHP officials’ review, as required by statute, CMS conducts regulatory impact assessments that estimate the effect of policy changes on payments to hospitals, including small rural hospitals, and publishes key results as part of proposed and final rules. For example, as part of the fiscal year 2018 final rule on Medicare payment for hospital inpatient services, CMS estimated that the expiration of the Medicare Dependent Hospital designation would have decreased the payments to rural hospitals with that designation by 0.9 percent, or approximately $119 million. Subsequent to the final rule, the Medicare Dependent Hospital and Low Volume Hospital designations were both extended. To monitor rural residents’ access to hospital services, HHS relies on research conducted by the FORHP-funded research centers. Examples of recent research on rural residents’ access to hospital services conducted by FORHP-funded research centers include the following: Research on rural residents’ access to hospitals. In 2018 the North Carolina rural health research center published an analysis of populations in rural counties without access to an acute care hospital or other types of primary care facilities. North Carolina’s researchers estimated that about 4.4 million rural residents currently live in a county without an acute care hospital. Research on access to specific hospital services. The Minnesota rural health research center conducted a body of research on declining access to obstetric services in rural counties. These researchers found that between 2004 and 2014, the percent of rural counties without hospital obstetric services increased from 45 to 54 percent, through a combination of hospital and obstetric-unit closures. Research on options for ensuring rural residents’ access after a hospital closure. The Iowa rural health research center published a summary of currently available options for ensuring rural residents’ access to hospital services after a hospital closure, and additional policy options under consideration. The National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services, a 21-member citizens’ panel of nationally recognized rural health experts that advises HHS, also examined this topic, with a focus on alternative models to preserve rural residents’ access to emergency care in light of the recent surge in rural hospital closures. The committee noted that payments and grants to support rural hospitals were largely effective and stabilized rural hospital financial operations until 2013, when a new wave of rural hospital closures began. The report included recommendations regarding the design of alternative models, including that HHS seek public comments on the use of a combination of geographic distance and demographic or social determinants of health when setting eligibility criteria. To supplement the monitoring by FORHP-funded research centers, FORHP officials also track recent rural developments and reports from rural health stakeholders. FORHP officials said this monitoring adds a qualitative component to the quantitative research conducted by research centers. In particular, these activities often provide the first notice of a rural hospital closure or pending closure, and also help track changes to the status of former hospitals over time. HHS uses the results of its monitoring activities on rural hospitals’ financial viability and rural residents’ access to inform related research, primarily conducted by HHS-funded research centers, and to determine future areas of research. For example, the North Carolina rural health research center has used the list of rural hospital closures it compiles and its monitoring of profitability to conduct research on predictors of rural hospitals’ financial distress. In addition, FORHP officials stated that, based on this monitoring, they have added topics to research centers’ agendas for subsequent years to gather more information on regulatory changes identified in its review of policy changes. Each year, specific research projects for the rural health research center are selected jointly by the center directors and FORHP. Topics are selected to have a timely impact on policy debates and decisions at both federal and state levels. Examples of added topics include North Carolina’s research on the financial importance of the Sole Community Hospital and Low Volume Hospital designations and Iowa’s research on the engagement of rural providers in Accountable Care Organizations. HHS has also used the results of its monitoring activities to update the types of services offered by certain grants and create new cooperative agreements for technical assistance. Specifically, for fiscal year 2016, FORHP officials updated the list of activities that Rural Health Network Development Planning grantees can spend funds on to include implementing innovative solutions to alleviate the loss of local services and enhance access to care in communities that have or are at risk of losing their local hospital. According to FORHP officials, the addition of this activity to the scope of the grant led to 11 of the 47 applicants from fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to come from rural communities with a recent rural hospital closure or perceived risk of closure. As another example, in response to increased funding, in 2018 FORHP announced a new cooperative agreement to provide targeted in-depth assistance to vulnerable rural hospitals within communities struggling to maintain health care services. The awardee of the Vulnerable Rural Hospitals Assistance Program must work with vulnerable hospitals and their communities on ways to ensure hospitals and communities can keep needed care locally, whether it is with a more limited set of services provided by the hospital, or by exploring other mechanisms for meeting community health care needs. FORHP disseminates the results of this research and successful rural health grants and other projects by funding cooperative agreements to maintain clearinghouses of information about rural health issues. These clearinghouses were originally designed to efficiently disseminate research findings from rural health research centers to the public and to help rural communities identify opportunities and information to provide better healthcare to their residents. According to one of these clearinghouses, since then, the focus has grown to developing evidence- based resources on rural health to share what works in rural communities, including toolkits and case studies. Our analysis of data from the North Carolina rural health research center and CMS shows that, from 2013 through 2017, 64 of the approximately 2400 rural hospitals in the United States closed. These 64 rural hospital closures represented the following: More than twice the number of rural hospitals that closed during the prior 5-year period. From 2008 through 2012, 31 rural hospitals closed (see fig. 1). More than the share of urban hospitals that closed. The 64 rural hospital closures from 2013 through 2017—approximately 3 percent of all rural hospitals in 2013—exceeded the 49 urban hospital closures during the same time period—approximately 2 percent of all urban hospitals in 2013. More than the number of rural hospitals that opened. The 42 rural hospitals closed from 2014 through 2016 exceeded the 3 rural hospitals opened during the same time period. Approximately half of the rural hospitals that closed from 2013 through 2017—47 percent—ceased to provide any type of services. The remaining hospitals that closed during this period converted to other facility types, providing more limited or different services, such as urgent care, emergency care, outpatient care, or primary care. Our analysis of data from the North Carolina rural health research center and CMS shows that rural hospitals with certain characteristics—including those located in the South—accounted for a disproportionate share of the 64 closures that occurred from 2013 through 2017. Geography. Rural hospitals located in the South represented 38 percent of the rural hospitals in 2013, but accounted for 77 percent of the rural hospital closures from 2013 through 2017 (see fig. 2). Texas, one southern state, represented 7 percent of the rural hospitals in 2013, but accounted for 22 percent of the rural hospitals closures from 2013 through 2017. Medicare rural hospital payment designations. Medicare Dependent Hospitals – one of three Medicare rural hospital payment designations in which hospitals were eligible to receive a payment rate other than standard Medicare inpatient payment rate – were disproportionately represented among hospital closures. Specifically, Medicare Dependent Hospitals represented 9 percent of the rural hospitals in 2013, but accounted for 25 percent of the rural hospital closures from 2013 through 2017. Rural hospitals that did not receive one of these three Medicare rural hospital payment designations also represented a disproportionate share of the closures (see fig. 3). In addition, hospitals designated as Low Volume Hospitals had a disproportionate share of the rural hospital closures. Ownership. For-profit rural hospitals represented 11 percent of the rural hospitals in 2013, but accounted for 36 percent of the rural hospital closures from 2013 through 2017 (see fig. 4). According to literature we reviewed, hospitals with for-profit status had a higher probability of financial distress and were more likely to close. For example, a 2017 study found that for-profit hospitals were more than twice as likely to experience financial distress relative to government- owned and non-profit hospitals from 2000 through 2013. Bed size. Rural hospitals with between 26 and 49 inpatient beds represented 11 percent of the rural hospitals in 2013, but accounted for 23 percent of the rural hospital closures from 2013 through 2017. Critical Access Hospitals have 25 acute inpatient beds or less and make up a majority of the rural hospitals, but were less likely than other rural hospitals to close. FORHP officials identified the Critical Access Hospital payment designation – in which Medicare pays designated hospitals based on their costs – paired with the related Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility grant program as the most effective HHS payment policy and program to support rural hospitals’ financial viability and rural residents’ access to hospital services. According to literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed, rural hospital closures were generally preceded and caused by financial distress. In particular, rural hospitals that closed typically had negative margins which made it difficult to cover their fixed costs. For example, one 2016 study found that rural hospitals that closed from 2010 through 2014 had a median operating margin of -7.41 percent in 2009. In contrast, rural hospitals that remained open during the same time period had a median operating margin of 2.00 percent in 2009. In addition, there is evidence that for-profit hospitals have been more sensitive to changes in profitability and more likely to experience financial distress, which could explain the disproportionate number of closures among rural hospitals with for-profit ownership type. The literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed identified multiple factors that likely contributed to increased financial distress and closures among rural hospitals. One such factor was a decrease in patients seeking inpatient care at rural hospitals due to the following: Increased competition for the small volume of rural residents. Rural residents may choose to obtain services from other health care providers separate from the local rural hospital, for example from an increasing number of federally qualified health centers or newer hospital systems outside of the area. The competition for the small volume of rural residents between rural hospitals and other health care providers potentially increased due to the shift to paying for value instead of volume, and technology changes. This increased competition for a small volume of rural residents could explain disproportionate closures among hospitals receiving the Low Volume Hospital Medicare payment designation, hospitals that by definition have a low Medicare volume and that research has found have lower margins than other rural hospitals. In addition, representatives from the American Hospital Association told us that technological advances have allowed more services to be provided in outpatient settings. For example, changes in health care technology have expanded the provision of outpatient surgical procedures. Declining rural population. The years 2010 through 2016 marked the first recorded period of rural population decline. According to literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed, the recent population decline in rural areas was likely associated with the recent decline in rural residents seeking inpatient services. Another factor highlighted by literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed as contributing to rural hospitals’ increased financial distress was across-the-board Medicare payment reductions. Rural hospitals are sensitive to changes to Medicare payments because, on average, Medicare accounted for approximately 46 percent of their gross patient revenues in 2016. A 2016 study found that Medicare Dependent Hospitals’ operating margins decreased each year from 2012 through 2014, which could explain the disproportionate number of closures among the Medicare Dependent Hospital payment designation. The literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed highlighted the recent Medicare payments cuts as contributing to rural hospital closures, which included the following: Reductions in nearly all Medicare reimbursements. Under sequestration – the cancellation of budgetary resources under presidential order implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended – each fiscal year since 2013, nearly all Medicare’s budget authority is subject to a reduction not exceeding 2 percent, which is implemented through reductions in payment amounts. According to stakeholders we interviewed, these payment reductions have contributed to negative margins for rural hospitals. Reductions in Medicare bad debt payments. Under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Medicare bad debt reimbursements for hospitals were reduced beginning in fiscal year 2013. According to stakeholders, Medicare bad debt cuts have been one of the most important factors contributing to the recent increase in rural hospital closures. The literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed also identified factors that likely strengthened the financial viability of rural hospitals. Chief among these factors was the increased Medicaid eligibility and enrollment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A 2018 study found that Medicaid expansion was associated with improved hospital financial performance and substantially lower likelihood of closure, especially in rural markets and counties with large numbers of uninsured adults before Medicaid expansion. Another 2017 study found that from 2008-2009 and 2014-2015 the drop in uninsured rates corresponded with states’ decisions to expand Medicaid on or before January 1, 2014. The increase in Medicaid coverage and decline in uninsured were both largest in the small towns and rural areas of those expansion states. Additionally, our analysis of data from the North Carolina rural health research center and CMS shows that from 2013 through 2017, rural hospitals in states that had expanded Medicaid as of April 2018 were less likely to close compared with rural hospitals in states that had not expanded Medicaid (see fig. 5).

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) identified several rural-specific HHS payment policies and programs as providing key support to rural hospitals, and in turn, rural residents’ access to hospital services. These key HHS payment policies and programs may be placed into three categories: Medicare rural hospital payment designations (table 2); Rural grants, cooperative agreements and contracts (table 3); and New approaches in rural health care delivery and payment (table 4). In addition to the contact named above, Greg Giusto (Assistant Director), Alison Binkowski (Analyst-in-Charge), George Bogart, Zhi Boon, Leia Dickerson, Krister Friday, Mike Hoffman, Peter Mann-King, Beth Morrison, Vikki Porter, Merrile Sing, and Chris Woika made key contributions to this report.", "answers": ["Research has shown that hospital closures can affect rural residents' access to health care services and that certain rural residents—particularly those who are elderly and low income—may be especially affected by rural hospital closures. This report describes (1) how HHS supports and monitors rural hospitals' financial viability and rural residents' access to hospital services and (2) the number and characteristics of rural hospitals that have closed in recent years and what is known about the factors that have contributed to those closures. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from HHS and HHS-funded research centers; analyzed data compiled by HHS and an HHS-funded research center, with a focus on 2013 through 2017—the most recent year with complete data; reviewed relevant literature; and interviewed experts and stakeholders. GAO identified hospitals as rural if they met the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's definition of rural. GAO provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment. The Department provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers multiple payment policies and programs that provide financial support for rural hospitals and funds research centers to monitor closures and study access. Among the payment policies administered by HHS are special payment designations for rural hospitals in which rural hospitals that meet certain criteria receive higher reimbursements for hospital services than they otherwise would receive under Medicare's standard payment methodology. HHS-funded research centers monitor rural hospitals' profitability and other financial indicators, and study access to facilities and specific services. HHS uses the results of monitoring activities to inform future areas of research and disseminate information. GAO's analysis of data from HHS and an HHS-funded research center shows that 64 rural hospitals closed from 2013 through 2017. This represents approximately 3 percent of all the rural hospitals in 2013 and more than twice the number of closures of the prior 5-year period. GAO's analysis further shows that rural hospital closures disproportionately occurred in the South, among for-profit hospitals, and among hospitals that received the Medicare Dependent Hospital payment designation, one of the special Medicare payment designations for rural hospitals. According to literature GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed, rural hospital closures were generally preceded and caused by financial distress. In particular, rural hospitals that closed typically had negative margins that made it difficult to cover their fixed costs. According to these sources, financial distress has been exacerbated in recent years by multiple factors, including the decrease in patients seeking inpatient care and across-the-board Medicare payment reductions. In contrast, according to the literature GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed, rural hospitals located in states that increased Medicaid eligibility and enrollment experienced fewer closures."], "length": 4796, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "61a783e1bd3bbe159042de9b9c5028d504cdfb98fa2c6524"}
{"input": "", "context": "First enacted in 1965, the Older Americans Act (OAA, P.L. 89-73, as amended) is the primary federal vehicle for the delivery of social and nutrition services for older persons. The majority of OAA grant funds are provided to states and other entities based on statutory formulas that exist in the following titles: Title III, Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging; Title V, Community Service Employment for Older Americans; Title VI, Grants for Older Native Americans; and Title VII, Vulnerable Elder Rights Protection Activities. These formula grants fund programs that assist older Americans with supportive services in their homes; congregate nutrition services (meals served at group sites such as senior centers, community centers, schools, churches, or senior housing complexes); home-delivered nutrition services; family caregiver support; community service employment; the long-term care ombudsman program; and services to prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older persons. The OAA also supports grants to older Native Americans for nutrition and supportive services. , Since enactment of OAA, Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times. Most recently, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-144 ) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, and made other changes to the act, including changes to four Title III programs that receive funding under statutory formulas. Prior to the 2016 OAA reauthorization, the OAA Amendments of 2006 ( P.L. 109-365 ) reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011. Although the authorizations of appropriations under the OAA expired at the end of FY2011, Congress continued to appropriate funding for OAA-authorized activities through FY2016. For most OAA programs, entities such as states, U.S. territories, and tribal organizations are allotted funding based on a population-based formula factor (e.g., aged 55 and over, aged 60 and over, or aged 70 and over). Some statutory requirements for program funding allocations include a \"hold harmless\" provision, which guarantees that states' or other entities' allotments will remain at a certain fiscal year level or amount, provided sufficient funding in a given year (e.g., FY2000 levels or FY2018 levels less 1%). The following describes the OAA statutory provisions that allocate funds to states and other entities under the various titles of the act. Title III authorizes grants to State Units on Aging (SUAs) and Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories to act as advocates on behalf of, and to coordinate programs for, older persons (defined in the law as those aged 60 and older). The Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Administration for Community Living (ACL) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), allocates Title III funds to SUAs. The states, in turn, award funds to more than 600 AAAs, which are designated by states to operate within specified planning and service areas. States must develop an intrastate funding formula for distribution of Title III funding within the state that takes into account the geographical distribution of older individuals in the state as well as the distribution of older individuals with greatest economic and social need (with particular attention to low-income minority older individuals) among specified planning and service areas. The state formula for distribution of Title III funding must be developed in accordance with AOA guidelines and approved by the Assistant Secretary for Aging. As the OAA's largest component, discretionary spending under Title III accounts for 73% of the act's total FY2019 appropriations ($1.498 billion out of $2.055 billion). States receive separate allotments of funds for the following six programs authorized under Title III: (1) supportive services and senior centers, (2) congregate nutrition services, (3) home-delivered nutrition services, (4) the Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP), (5) disease prevention and health promotion services, and (6) the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP). States are required to provide a matching share of 15% in order to receive funds for supportive services and congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs. A matching share of 25% is required for the NFCSP; no match is required for NSIP and disease prevention and health promotion services. To determine state allotments, a separate allocation is calculated for each of the six grant programs. The same formula is used to determine state allocations for supportive services and senior centers, congregate nutrition services, home-delivered nutrition services, and disease prevention and health promotion services. The formulas for the NSIP and NFCSP use different factors. The funding formula for four of these Title III programs—supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services—has been a major point of contention during the past three OAA reauthorizations of 2000, 2006, and 2016. Appendix A of the report provides a detailed legislative history of the Title III funding formula changes and describes the debate surrounding changes to the Title III funding formula during the OAA reauthorizations of 2000, 2006, and 2016. Appendix B provides an analysis of the state-based population data for the U.S. population age 60 and older for these Title III programs. Appendix C compares FY2016 allotment amounts for states and other entities with actual allotment amounts under the statutory funding formula changes in P.L. 114-144 for FY2017 to FY2019 for Title III Parts B, C1, C2 and D programs. Separate state allotments for (1) supportive services and senior centers, (2) congregate nutrition services, (3) home-delivered nutrition services, and (4) disease prevention and health promotion services are based on a population formula factor that is defined as each state's relative share of the total U.S. population aged 60 years and older. For the purposes of this calculation, the total U.S. population aged 60 and older includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories. Population data are from annual population estimates published by the U.S. Census; the reference date for estimates is July 1. There is a two-year time lag between the reference year of the population estimates and the respective appropriation year. For example, FY2019 state allotments are calculated using 2017 estimates of the population aged 60 and older. For the purpose of determining state allotments, the law requires that allotments meet two criteria. The first criterion is the \"small state minimum.\" This ensures that all states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) receive a minimum amount of funds, which is defined as 0.5% (one-half of 1%) of the total grant appropriation for the respective fiscal year. Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands each are allotted no less than 0.25% (one-quarter of 1%) of the total grant amount, and American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are each allotted no less than 0.0625% (one-sixteenth of 1%) of the total grant amount. The second criterion is the \"hold harmless\" provision. The OAA Reauthorization Act of 2016 Amendments ( P.L. 114-144 ) reduces state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts (previously referenced to FY2006 funding levels) by 1% from the previous fiscal year as follows: For FY2017, no state receives less than 99% of the annual amount allotted to the state in FY2016. For FY2018, no state receives less than 99% of the annual amount allotted to the state in FY2017. For FY2019, no state receives less than 99% of the annual amount allotted to the state in FY2018. For FY2020 and each subsequent fiscal year, no state receives less than 100% of the annual amount allotted to the state in FY2019. The Nutrition Services Incentives Program (NSIP) provides funds to states, territories, and Indian tribal organizations to purchase food or to cover the costs of food commodities provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs. NSIP funds are allotted to states and other entities based on a formula that takes into account each state's share of total meals served by the nutrition services program (both congregate and home-delivered meals) in all states and tribes during the prior year. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) provides direct services for caregivers in five core service areas: Information about health conditions, resources, and community-based services. Assistance with accessing available services. Individual counseling, support groups, and caregiver training. Respite care services to provide families temporary relief from caregiving responsibilities. Supplemental services on a limited basis that would complement care provided by family and other caregivers (e.g., adult day health care, home care, home modifications, and assistive devices). Funds for NFCSP are allotted to states based on each state's relative share of the population aged 70 years and older. States receive a minimum grant amount, which is defined as 0.5% (one-half of 1%) of the total grant appropriation for the respective fiscal year. Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands are allotted no less than 0.25% (one-quarter of 1%) of the total grant appropriation, and American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are allotted no less than 0.0625% (one-sixteenth of 1%) of the total grant appropriation. There is no hold harmless provision in the formula allocation for this grant program. Title V authorizes the Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program (CSEOA). Administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), Title V is OAA's second-largest program and is the only federally subsidized employment program for low-income older persons (defined in the law as those aged 55 and older with incomes up to 125% of the federal poverty guidelines). Its FY2019 funding of $400 million represents 20% of the act's total discretionary funding. There is a 10% nonfederal match requirement for Title V grant activities. DOL allocates Title V funds for grants to state agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories, and to national grantees who are typically nonprofit organizations that operate in more than one state. The total Title V state allotment is the sum of its respective state agency grantee allotment and national grantee allotment for activities in that state. To determine grant allotments for each state, a separate allocation is calculated for each grant type. The 2016 OAA reauthorization did not revise the Title V funding formula, but the formula had been an issue for Congress in the past. During the 2006 OAA reauthorization, the original House bill ( H.R. 5293 ) included a provision to update the \"hold harmless\" year in the Title V formula from FY2000 to FY2006; however, the Senate bill ( S. 3570 ) did not include this provision. The compromise bill ( H.R. 6197 ) enacted into law made no changes to the Title V formula. The following describes the Title V formula allocation. Before allocation of funds to states, DOL is required to reserve funds as follows: up to 1.5% of the total appropriation for Section 502(e) demonstration projects, pilot projects, and evaluation projects; 0.75% of the total appropriation for Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and \"such amount as may be necessary\" for national grants to public or private organizations serving eligible Indians and Pacific Island and Asian Americans. After these reservations, the remaining funds are divided into two amounts, one for all state agency grantees and the other for all national grantees. The allocation for these amounts is dependent on program funding. If funds for a given year are equal to their FY2000 level of $440.2 million, then amounts set aside for all state agencies and all national grantees are in proportion to their respective FY2000 levels. If funds for a given year are less than their FY2000 levels, then total amounts for the state and national grantees are reduced proportionately. If funds for a given year exceed the FY2000 level, up to $35 million of the excess is to be distributed as follows: 75% of the excess is to be provided for all state agency grantees and 25% of the excess is to be provided to all national grantees. Any funding amount over $35 million that remains is to be distributed 50/50 to all state agency and national grantees, respectively. Once the total funding levels for grants for state agency and national grantees have been determined, the same formula is used to determine the state agency allotment and the national grantee allotment for each state. Each allotment is distributed to states based on a formula that takes into account (1) a state's share of the total U.S. population aged 55 years and older (includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), and (2) the state per capita income relative to other states. The formula favors states with a lower per capita income and a higher proportion of the population aged 55 and older relative to other states. Population data are from the annual population estimates published by the U.S. Census; the reference date for estimates is July 1. Per capita income data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). There is a two-year time lag between the data (reference year of the population estimates and per capita income) and the respective appropriation year. For the purpose of determining state allotments to state agency and national grantees, the law requires that allotments meet two criteria. The first criterion is that states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) are to receive at least a minimum grant allotment, which is defined as 0.5% (one-half of 1%) of the respective grant amount for the given fiscal year. The second criterion is the \"hold harmless\" provision. If grant amounts for a given year are equal to, or less than, their FY2000 level, states are to receive an allotment in proportion to their respective FY2000 levels. If grant amounts exceed their FY2000 levels, states are to receive no less than their FY2000 level plus a \"guaranteed growth\" of at least 30% of the percentage increase above the FY2000 level. Title VI authorizes funds for supportive and nutrition services to older Native Americans to promote the delivery of home and community-based supportive services, nutrition services, and family caregiver support. Funds are awarded directly to Indian tribal organizations, Alaskan Native organizations, and nonprofit groups representing Native Hawaiians. To be eligible for funding, a tribal organization must represent at least 50 Native American elders aged 60 or older. In FY2017, grants were awarded to 270 tribal organizations representing 400 Indian tribes, including one organization serving Native Hawaiian elders. FY2019 funding for supportive and nutrition services grants is $34.2 million, while FY2019 funding for the Native American caregiver program is $10.1 million. There is no requirement for tribal organizations to match these grant funds. Separate formula grant awards are made for (1) nutrition and supportive services and (2) family caregiver support services. Formula grants for services to older Native Americans are allocated to tribal and other representing organizations based on their share of the American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian population aged 60 and over in their services area. Tribal organization allotments must meet a FY1991 \"hold harmless\" provision. If funds for a given year exceed the FY1991 amount, then the grant amount is either (1) increased to equal or approximate the amount the organization received in 1980 or (2) determined based on what the Assistant Secretary considers sufficient if the tribal organization did not receive a grant for either FY1980 or FY1991. For Native Hawaiian programs, formula allotments for services to representing organizations are only required to meet a FY1991 \"hold harmless\" provision. Title VII authorizes the Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman Program and elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation prevention programs. Most Title VII funding is directed at the LTC Ombudsman Program, the purpose of which is to investigate and resolve complaints of residents of nursing facilities and other long-term care facilities. For FY2019, funding for the LTC Ombudsman and Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation Prevention Programs totals $21.7 million. There is no requirement for states to match these grant funds. Funds for LTC ombudsman and elder abuse prevention activities are allotted to states based on each state's relative share of the population aged 60 years and older. For the purpose of determining state allotments, the law requires that states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) receive a minimum amount of funds, which is defined as 0.5% (one-half of 1%) of the total grant appropriation for the respective fiscal year. Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands are allotted no less than 0.25% (one-quarter of 1%) of the total grant appropriation, and American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are allotted no less than 0.0625% (one-sixteenth of 1%) of the total grant appropriation. State allotments must also meet a FY2000 \"hold harmless\" provision. SUAs may award funds for these activities to a variety of organizations for administration, including other state agencies, AAAs, county governments, nonprofit service providers, and volunteer organizations. Appendix A. Legislative History of OAA Title III Funding Formula When the OAA was enacted in 1965, Title III funds were allocated to states based on their relative share of the population aged 65 and over. The law also set certain minimum grant amounts for states and territories. For states, the minimum allotment was 1% of total funds appropriated, and for the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, the minimum allotment was 0.5% (one-half of 1%) of funds appropriated. These provisions remained in effect until 1973. The first significant change to the OAA Title III funding formula occurred under the 1973 amendments to the act, which based the formula on the states' relative share of the population aged 60 and over, rather than, as under prior law, aged 65 and over. The 1973 amendments also changed the minimum allotments states and territories were to receive, as follows: states were to receive no less than 0.5% of the total appropriation; and Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands were to receive no less than 0.25% (one-fourth of 1%) of total funds. In addition, the 1973 amendments specified that states were to receive no less than they received in FY1973 (the hold harmless amount). These provisions remained in effect until the 1978 amendments, which changed the minimum amounts for American Samoa to one-sixteenth of 1% of the appropriation, and added a minimum funding amount for the Northern Marianas (also one-sixteenth of 1%). The 1978 amendments also changed the year for the hold harmless amount. The law stipulated that for fiscal years after 1978, states were to receive no less than they received in FY1978, rather than, as in prior law, FY1973. Successive amendments subsequently changed the hold harmless year. Amendments in 1984 required that for fiscal years after FY1984, states be allotted no less than they received for services in FY1984. There were no changes to the formula provisions under the 1987 amendments. The 1992 amendments moved the hold harmless reference year to FY1987. No further changes were made to these funding formulas until the 2000 amendments. The OAA Amendments of 2000 and 2006 The Title III funding formula for supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services has been a point of controversy in recent congressional attempts to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. Initially, Congress was concerned that the method AOA used to distribute Title III funds was inconsistent with statutory requirements, thereby negatively affecting states experiencing faster growth in their older population. However, more recently, congressional debate has focused on whether or not the statutory formula itself accurately reflects trends in the aging of the U.S. population. The following provides a brief overview of the debate and legislative changes to the Title III funding formula in the OAA reauthorizations of 2000 and 2006. After unsuccessful attempts in the 104 th and 105 th Congresses to reauthorize the OAA, the 106 th Congress approved the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000 ( P.L. 106-501 ). The Title III funding formula was a controversial issue during the six years of congressional debate on the 2000 OAA reauthorization. Prior to the reauthorization, a 1994 U.S. General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office, or GAO) report found that the method AOA used did not distribute funds among states proportionately to their older population to the maximum extent possible. Instead, AOA allotted funds to states, first according to an amount equal to their FY1987 \"hold harmless\" allocation, with the remainder of the appropriations allotted to states based on their relative share of the population aged 60 and over. This methodology negatively affected states with faster-growing older populations, since the majority of funds were being distributed according to population estimates that did not reflect the most recent trends. The GAO report recommended that AOA revise its methodology for distributing funds to states. In response to these concerns, the 2000 OAA reauthorization resulted in the following changes to the law: (1) Congress clarified the law to ensure that, first, funds were allotted to states based on the most recent population data; (2) Congress created an FY2000 \"hold harmless\" requirement, thereby ensuring that no state would receive less than it received in FY2000; and (3) Congress created the \"guaranteed growth\" provision, ensuring that all states would receive a share of any appropriations increase over the FY2000 level. The Title III funding formula also became a major point of contention during the 2006 OAA reauthorization debate. Congress revisited the FY2000 \"hold harmless\" requirement and \"guaranteed growth\" provision. At the time, the \"hold harmless\" requirement ensured that, provided sufficient funds, every state and U.S. territory received at least its FY2000 amount. The \"guaranteed growth\" provision guaranteed that all states received a certain share of any increase above the FY2000 appropriation. These issues divided Members from states with relatively faster-growing older populations from lawmakers representing states with relatively slower growth in their older populations. High-growth states argued that the \"hold harmless\" provisions in current law provided protections to states whose populations were not increasing as quickly as others', resulting in an inequitable distribution of funds that disadvantaged high-growth states. The OAA 2006 Amendments ultimately resulted in changes to the law as follows: (1) Congress changed the formula to ensure that, provided sufficient funds, every state receives at least its FY2006 amount (creating a new fiscal year \"hold harmless\" amount); and (2) Congress phased out the \"guaranteed growth\" provision, reducing the share of any increase in appropriations from 20% to 0 by 5 percentage points annually beginning in FY2008. For FY2007 through FY2010, the guaranteed growth provisions were as follows: 20% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2007; 15% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2008; 10% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2009; and 5% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2010. Under current law, for FY2011 and any succeeding fiscal years, the formula does not include the guaranteed growth provision. The OAA Reauthorization of 2016 The Title III funding formula for supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services continued to be a major point of contention during the 2016 OAA reauthorization debate, which spanned multiple Congresses. Congress again revisited the issue of how much state population growth should influence state funding allocations versus retaining continuity in funding allocations for slower-growth states. In the 113 th Congress, comprehensive OAA reauthorization legislation was introduced in the Senate ( S. 1028 and S. 1562 ) which would have extended the authorizations of appropriations through FY2018 for most OAA programs and would have made various amendments to existing OAA authorities. The Senate HELP Committee ordered S. 1562 reported favorably with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. In the House of Representatives, two OAA reauthorization bills were introduced ( H.R. 3850 and H.R. 4122 ). These bills were referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, but saw no further legislative action. Prior to legislative consideration, the topic of OAA statutory funding formulas was again examined by GAO in an analysis of the OAA Title III and VII statutory funding formulas that focused on formula modifications that would capture state differences with respect to need by including factors that measure the needs of the elderly population, costs of services in addressing those needs, and the capacity of states to finance needed services. GAO found that the current formulas could better meet generally accepted equity standards in targeting OAA services to those with \"greatest economic need\" and \"greatest social need.\" For example, GAO found that the need for OAA services can be estimated using data on older individuals' functional limitations. GAO also noted that while revisions to the OAA statutory formula may pose challenges, options to ease the transition such as phasing in implementation over several years and/or instituting funding floors or ceilings may be further provisions for policymakers to consider in any statutory revisions. In the 113 th Congress, S. 1562 did not contain provisions that would amend OAA statutory funding formulas. However, during the Senate HELP Committee consideration of the OAA reauthorization bill, Senator Richard Burr introduced an amendment that would have removed the Title III Part B (supportive services and senior centers), Part C (nutrition services), and Part D (disease prevention and health promotion services) FY2006 hold harmless provision, which was rejected. Senator Tom Harkin, then chairman, stated there would be additional examination of the OAA funding formula by a Senate bipartisan workgroup with a possible solution prior to Senate floor consideration. The bill was subsequently reported out of committee and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar, but did not receive consideration by the Senate. The bill saw no further action in the Senate. In the 114th Congress, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2015 ( S. 192 ) was introduced on January 20, 2015. The bill authorized appropriations for most OAA programs for a three-year period from FY2016 to FY2018. It also made various amendments to existing OAA authorities, including changes to the statutory funding formula for the supportive services and senior centers, congregate nutrition, home-delivered nutrition, and disease prevention and health promotion services under Title III of the act, which lessens the effect of the hold harmless provision over time. The Senate HELP Committee ordered S. 192 reported favorably, and it subsequently passed the Senate on July 16, 2015. The House took up S. 192 on March 21, 2016, and passed the bill with an amendment authorizing appropriations for the three-year period from FY2017 to FY2019. S. 192 , as amended by the House, did not substantively change the hold harmless provision under S. 192 , as passed by the Senate. Rather, it amended the effective dates for the hold harmless reduction, from FY2016 through FY2018 to FY2017 through FY2019. It froze this reduction in place for FY2020 and future fiscal years, unless or until such language is amended. The Senate passed S. 192 as amended by the House on April 7, 2016. President Barack Obama signed P.L. 114-144 , the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016, on April 19, 2016. Specifically, P.L. 114-144 changed the statutory funding allocations for OAA Title III, Parts B, C, and D. This provision retained the same state and U.S. territory minimum amounts allotted under current law and the same population-based formula factor (aged 60 and over), but reduced state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts (currently referenced to FY2006 funding levels) by 1% from the previous fiscal year. The law lessens the effect of the FY2006 hold harmless provision by reducing state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts by 1% for each of three years, and then freezes this reduction in place for FY2020 and future fiscal years, unless or until such language is amended. Effectively, for those states that receive an annual program allotment based on their FY2006 hold harmless amount, the policy change minimizes any reduction in funding to no more than 1% from the previous fiscal year, assuming a program's total funding level in fiscal years 2017 to 2019 is at or above the previous fiscal year's level. Appendix B. Population Trends Table B-1 shows the population aged 60 and older by state or U.S. territory and the proportion of the entity's population aged 60 and older relative to the total U.S. population aged 60 and over for selected years. U.S. Census data shown are for the 2000 and 2010 Decennial Censuses, as well as the 2017 Intercensal state population estimates, which is the most recent year for which data are available. There is a two-year time lag between the reference year of the population estimates and the respective appropriation year. For example, FY2019 state allotments are calculated using 2017 estimates of the population aged 60 and older. The column labeled \"% Age 60+\" is the entities' relative share of the 60+ population, which functions as its population-based formula factor used to determine state allotments under OAA Title III, Parts B, C, and D and Title VII. The final column of Table B-1 calculates the percentage point change in the population formula factor for each state and U.S. territory from 2000 to 2017. Among all 56 states and U.S. territories (which includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), 29 entities saw a proportionate increase in the population formula factor from 2000 to 2017, while 27 saw a decrease over this time period. The top five states that experienced the greatest proportionate increase were Texas (+0.93%), California (+0.56%), Georgia (+0.47%), North Carolina (+0.37%), and Arizona (+0.37%). The bottom five states that experienced the greatest decline were Pennsylvania (-0.85%), New York (-0.79%), Ohio (-0.44%), Illinois (-0.42%), and New Jersey (-0.35%). Appendix C. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-144 ): Analysis of Formula Change The following analysis compares FY2016 allotment amounts for states and other entities with actual allotment amounts under the statutory funding formula change in P.L. 114-144 for FY2017 to FY2019. The following tables provide results by program: Table C-1 : Title III, Part B, supportive services and senior centers; Table C-2 : Title III, Part C, subpart 1, congregate nutrition services; Table C-3 : Title III, Part C, subpart 2, home-delivered nutrition services; and Table C-4 : Title III, Part D, disease prevention and health promotion services programs. Each table compares FY2016 state and U.S. territory allotments prior to the statutory funding formula change under P.L. 114-144 to allotments with the change, for FY2017 through FY2019. The columns in each table provide two types of analyses for each year. The first is the percentage change between the entities' FY2016 allotment and the entities' annual allotment for each year, respectively. The second is the entities' allotment type for each year of the change, where \"M\" refers to an entity that receives a minimum allotment amount; \"HH\" refers to an entity that receives an allotment amount based on 99% of the previous fiscal year's hold harmless funding amount; and \"P\" refers to an entity that receives an allotment amount based on the entities' population formula factor. For programs where the current law hold harmless is in effect (i.e., some states and territories receive an allotment based on their hold harmless), the change to the statutory funding formula, often also combined with increases in appropriated funding amounts, reduces the effect of the hold harmless over time. For example, 16 states and territories received an allotment based on their FY2006 hold harmless level for the congregate nutrition services program. Under the statutory funding formula change, the number of states and territories that received an allotment based on the hold harmless (99% of the previous fiscal year) remained at 16 in FY2017 with a 0.2% increase in the total allotment amount from the prior year. That number fell to 4 in FY2018 when combined with a 10% increase in the total allotment amount compared to the prior year and remained at 4 in FY2018. As a state or territory's hold harmless amount is reduced gradually by 1% from the previous year's hold harmless over three fiscal years, additional states and territories received funding based on their hold harmless amount. Effectively, the change to the statutory funding formula, especially when combined with increases in appropriated funding amounts, allows funding freed up from the hold harmless reductions to be redistributed to states and territories based on the population formula factor. Thus, more states and territories received funding based on their population aged 60 and over. Under the supportive services and senior centers and disease prevention and health promotion services programs all states and territories received funding in FY2016 based on a proportionate reduction to their FY2006 hold harmless amount. Total FY2016 funding for these programs was below FY2006 funding levels. The statutory funding formula change combined with program funding increases reduced the number of entities receiving an allotment based on their hold harmless from FY2017 to FY2018 (for supportive services, 29 states in FY2017, to 10 in FY2018; and for disease prevention, 28 states in FY2017, to 0 in FY2018). From FY2018 to FY2019, appropriated amounts for these programs did not change and the number of entities receiving an allotment based on their hold harmless increased slightly—to 12 entities for the supportive services program and 9 entities for disease prevention. For programs where the previous FY2006 hold harmless was not in effect, such as home-delivered nutrition services, the funding formula change had a smaller effect compared to prior law. Two states and territories receive funding for FY2017 based on their hold harmless amount. For FY2018 and FY2019 all states receiving funding based on either their population age 60 and older or the minimum grant amount. In general, the statutory funding formula change did not affect entities receiving an allotment based on the minimum grant amount as P.L. 114-144 made no change to this provision.", "answers": ["The Older Americans Act (OAA) is the major vehicle for the delivery of social and nutrition services for older persons. The act's statutory funding formulas determine allotments to states and other entities under the following OAA Titles: Title III, Grants for State and Community Programs; Title V, the Community Service Senior Opportunities Act; Title VI, Grants for Older Native Americans; and Title VII, Vulnerable Elder Rights Protection Activities. This report describes the OAA statutory provisions that allocate funds to states and other entities under various titles of the act. Title III accounts for 73% of the act's total FY2019 discretionary appropriations ($1.498 billion out of $2.055 billion). States receive separate allotments of funds for the following six programs authorized under Title III: (1) supportive services and senior centers, (2) congregate nutrition services, (3) home-delivered nutrition services, (4) the Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP), (5) disease prevention and health promotion services, and (6) the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP). Formula grants are allotted from the Administration on Aging (AOA), within the Administration for Community Living (ACL) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to State Units on Aging (SUAs) in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories. The states, in turn, award funds to approximately 629 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Title V authorizes the Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program (CSEOA). Administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), Title V is OAA's second-largest program and is the only federally subsidized employment program for low-income older persons. Its FY2019 funding of $400 million represents 20% of the act's total discretionary funding. DOL allocates Title V funds for grants to state agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories, and to national grantees who are typically nonprofit organizations that operate in more than one state. The total Title V state allotment is the sum of its respective state agency grantee allotment and national grantee allotment. Title VI authorizes funds for supportive and nutrition services to older Native Americans to promote the delivery of home and community-based supportive services, nutrition services, and family caregiver support. Funds are awarded directly to Indian tribal organizations, Alaskan Native organizations, and nonprofit groups representing Native Hawaiians. Title VII authorizes the Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman Program and elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation prevention programs. Most Title VII funding is directed at the LTC Ombudsman Program, the purpose of which is to investigate and resolve complaints of residents of nursing facilities and other long-term care facilities. Funds for LTC ombudsman and elder abuse prevention activities are allotted to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorizes appropriations for most OAA programs through FY2019. P.L. 114-144 also made changes to the statutory funding formulas for several programs under Title III of the act. Appendix A of the report provides a detailed legislative history of the Title III funding formula changes, including changes under P.L. 114-144, as well as the OAA reauthorizations of 2000 and 2006. Appendix B provides an analysis of the state-based population data for the U.S. population age 60 and older. Appendix C compares FY2016 allotment amounts for states and other entities with actual allotment amounts under the statutory funding formula change in P.L. 114-144 for FY2017 to FY2019 for Title III Parts B, C, and D programs."], "length": 6195, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "228f9186ad04ada9d0af76bbdf86395380c348f5d8e8d67f"}
{"input": "", "context": "Colleges are a unique and diverse sector, varying from small, private schools in rural environments to large public schools in major cities. As of the 2015-2016 school year (the most recent available data), there were approximately 4,000 degree-granting colleges in the United States. In addition to educating students in classrooms, many colleges also manage a number of related business operations, such as dormitories, scientific research facilities, hospitals, performing arts centers, athletic venues, child care facilities, transportation systems, and agricultural facilities. These various roles and responsibilities increase the complexity of emergency preparedness efforts. DHS has developed a national approach to emergency preparedness by setting a national preparedness goal and outlining activities for achieving it. This approach is designed to apply across all levels of government and sectors of the economy—including colleges, as well as local, state, and federal governments—and to prioritize collaboration among these entities. The National Preparedness Goal identifies activities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards and recognizes that preparedness is a shared responsibility of the whole community. The National Incident Management System (NIMS), which was developed by DHS’ Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), operationalizes the goal by providing a guide with advice for government and nongovernmental entities for managing emergencies, including identifying a common vocabulary and processes for responding to emergencies. For example, NIMS establishes a standardized approach for communicating information during emergencies and outlines a leadership structure for managing emergencies, called an “Incident Command System,” so that the various entities responding to an emergency can operate seamlessly. DHS, DOJ, and Education all develop and disseminate emergency preparedness resources in line with their respective missions. Other agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Weather Service, also produce information that can help with colleges’ emergency preparedness efforts. College offices responsible for emergency preparedness efforts and the number of staff assigned to such efforts varied among the 18 selected colleges we interviewed and generally received some input from other members of the campus community. According to guidance for emergency planning from DHS’ Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), emergency preparedness staff are generally responsible for tasks such as developing emergency plans, communicating and updating those plans, and taking a lead role during an actual event. College officials we spoke with said that their schools generally designated a lead office for emergency preparedness efforts. This lead office ranged from a dedicated emergency preparedness office at some colleges to offices that had non-emergency preparedness responsibilities as well, such as offices of public safety, student affairs, or facilities. About half of the officials responsible for emergency preparedness efforts at the 18 selected colleges we interviewed also spent time on other types of responsibilities that were not specific to emergency preparedness, such as health and safety issues. State agency officials and representatives from a college emergency preparedness association we spoke with also noted that emergency managers at colleges often “wear many hats,” or have limited time to devote to emergency planning, which makes their jobs more difficult. College officials often said balancing competing priorities was challenging. For example, an official at one college told us that if his school had more staff it could expand outreach efforts to students and faculty and design specific actions for a wider range of emergencies. In addition to having a lead office, most of the 18 colleges reported convening advisory committees or teams from the campus community to help develop or revise emergency preparedness plans. For example, one official at a large public university with over 36,000 students told us emergency plans are reviewed by an emergency response committee comprised of representatives from the business office, student housing, faculty, and the provost, among others. An official from another college reported that, while some campus community members played a less active part in developing the emergency plan, they were still responsible for understanding their roles and responsibilities in the event of an emergency. According to FEMA’s guidance for emergency plans, there are benefits to using a team approach. For example, the campus community is more likely to follow a plan if members have been involved in developing it because of a sense of shared ownership (see text box.) Two College Emergency Managers’ Descriptions of Emergency Preparedness Efforts On the day a campus police officer was shot and killed, several of the members of the campus leadership, including myself (the emergency manager) and chief of police, were off campus. Fortunately, many people on campus have been trained to manage a significant event because college leadership had placed a strong emphasis on emergency preparedness, including succession planning. When something occurs it is important to have a team that has practiced together and can provide leadership even if some key individuals are not on campus at the time. Hurricane Irma was 340 miles across, wider than the states of Florida and Georgia in some places. We were on the “dirty side” of the hurricane, just to the east of the eye. We were relieved that the damage on our campuses was not worse. Because of our actions before the storm—such as removing loose items like traffic cones and signage and tying down large equipment— we minimized the damage. College officials we interviewed described preparations for a range of emergencies and used a variety of tools to communicate and practice their plans (see text box). Officials we interviewed at all 18 colleges said their school developed “all hazards” emergency plans, which means the plans are designed to address a range of emergencies while prioritizing those that are most likely to affect their campus. This “all hazards” approach is supported by federal emergency preparedness principles as outlined in NIMS. Most college officials we spoke with said they prioritize at least one type of natural disaster that could occur in their geographical area, as well as manmade threats like active shooters. Most of the college officials reported talking with state or local partners or using some type of risk assessment tool or similar analysis to prioritize specific types of emergencies. College officials sometimes described this process as prioritizing emergencies that either occur more frequently, or are likely to have a significant effect on the college if they were to occur. For example, several officials at selected colleges said their schools prioritized active shooter events—even though they occur relatively rarely—because of incidents at other colleges or the potential effects on the community if such an event were to occur. A college’s specific characteristics can also inform its emergency plan. For example, officials from two colleges said their schools serve as research institutions and may need to take extra steps to secure scientific infrastructure in an emergency. Two officials described emergency preparedness efforts related to the physical location of their campus, such as bordering a body of water or being adjacent to an airport. Two College Emergency Managers’ Descriptions of Responding to Emergencies We knew that the hurricane was likely to hit other parts of our state badly, but we were not overly concerned that the hurricane would hit us directly. I came to work that morning and there were 20 buses on campus by our football field. We are an evacuation center but someone had forgotten to tell us that they were sending us 1,100 evacuees. Where were we going to put 1,100 people? These are the types of events that you plan for and hopefully you never have to implement those plans, but that day we had to do it. It took us about 4 or 5 hours between the time the buses showed up to when we had prepared the gymnasium with cots that were provided by the American Red Cross and food for the evacuees. The evacuees were here for 3 days. Our administrative staff slept on cots in our offices so that we were on campus the whole time the evacuees were here. Prior to the rally, we set up cameras in the area and arranged for additional security through mutual aid agreements with other police departments. We also convened in a nearby meeting room to monitor the situation. The situation turned violent very suddenly. At first, a couple hundred students and other individuals were in the area peacefully. Then a more rowdy group convened and within 15 minutes of their arrival, bottles were flying through the air and windows were being broken. I looked down for just a moment, then looked up again and a generator was on fire. We tried very hard to continue with the event because we believe in free speech, but safety became a concern and we had to cancel. It was very stressful and hard to watch. We were worried about the safety of our students. College officials we interviewed also outlined a variety of methods to communicate with the community in the event of an emergency and to conduct emergency drills. Officials we interviewed at the 18 selected colleges most commonly described using college websites, text messages, or mass email alerts to communicate emergency preparedness information to the campus community (see text box). Officials at several colleges also said they developed more detailed applications that students and faculty could download to their electronic devices for up-to-date emergency preparedness information. Two College Emergency Managers’ Descriptions of Emergency Communications Within minutes of the shooting, an alert was sent utilizing multiple channels including texts, email, message boards, web, desktop and voice messages. This serves two functions; it provides redundancy of delivery and also considers the different information receiving preferences of the community. Emergency messages, at a minimum, provide what happened, where it happened, and what action needs to be taken. Updates are sent when there is new information. It is recommended that during an emergency you communicate at least every 30 minutes. It is also important to ensure that correct up to date information is available, since inaccurate rumors can spread quickly through social media. Twitter helped us amplify our messages. We wrote these messages quickly, while doing many other things, so that the community could have information as soon as possible including about areas to avoid for safety reasons. After the fact, the messages also provided a time- stamped record of the events and the campus response to those events. About half of the colleges also told us that they offer training to communicate emergency preparedness information to specific groups such as students, faculty, and administrators. For example, an official at one college told us the college has targeted outreach to faculty by developing specific trainings that cover specific issues, such as what to do when classes are disrupted or a building is no longer accessible, for example, as the result of a weather event. Officials from several colleges also said they communicate emergency preparedness information during new student orientation. Several college officials acknowledged that engaging students can be challenging, and some officials said they address this challenge by making presentations or printed and online materials as engaging as possible. Emergency Preparedness Drills and Exercises College officials we interviewed also said their colleges practice and test emergency preparedness plans by conducting drills and exercises at least once a year. Most officials from the 18 selected colleges said they conducted evacuation drills, such as fire drills; a few officials said they conducted more time-intensive activities such as “tabletop exercises” (i.e., sessions in which officials meet to discuss their roles during a specific type of emergency). For example, a large public college conducted a tabletop exercise to simulate a hypothetical weather event that damaged a dormitory. One official at a large university also described how the college uses emergency preparedness principles to manage non- emergency events such as sports events in order to practice their plans. College emergency managers said that buy-in from a college’s top leadership was very important for promoting emergency preparedness efforts and increasing campus involvement. For example, one official described top leadership buy-in as the “guiding light” for the campus community. Another official said the president of his college made it mandatory for all executive staff to attend emergency preparedness trainings, which demonstrated his commitment to emergency planning and preparedness. When such support is lacking, officials said it is often difficult to engage students and faculty. For example, one college official told us that his college’s previous president viewed emergency preparedness as bothersome and a burden. The lack of support limited the type of drills that could be conducted on campus, the official said. Another official at a private 4-year school explained that his college could not participate in the “The Great ShakeOut” program because the drill fell outside of the allowable hours when drills were permitted to occur to avoid any conflicts with classroom instruction time. Officials at most of the 18 selected colleges stated that they relied on either their local or state partners, or both, for advice, questions, or to obtain resources for emergency preparedness. These partners were also the first responders for colleges experiencing emergencies and may include local and state police and fire departments, hospitals, and emergency management offices. Coordinating with partners is a key component of the federal emergency preparedness principles, as outlined in the National Preparedness Goal and NIMS. Most of the officials we spoke with at our selected colleges said they work with partners in their local community, such as police, fire, and emergency management departments or local public health agencies, in preparing for emergencies. For example, one official at a large public university described a mutual aid agreement with its local emergency management department, which allows his school access to the county’s radio communication system in the event of an emergency. The specific nature of local partnerships often varied based on factors such as the size of the college and the surrounding community. For example, we heard from some state, college, and association representatives that some smaller colleges did not have very extensive police or security departments, and therefore, relied heavily on local police departments when emergencies occurred. While coordination often involved planning for how a community could help a college in the event of an emergency, college and emergency preparedness association officials also described instances in which large universities in small towns had more emergency preparedness resources than the town and were therefore the ones offering help. For example, one large university in a part of the country prone to tornadoes offers shelter to town residents and employs emergency response coordinators to help individuals quickly find shelter. Officials also said interpersonal relationships play a big part in deciding to whom they reach out. Most of the college officials with whom we spoke highlighted the importance of their interpersonal relationships with local and/or state law enforcement or emergency management officials and in some cases, attributed these relationships to having previously worked in local or state law enforcement or emergency management. For example, one college official told us that his former role as a local police chief has made it easy to identify and maintain contacts with local police, fire, and emergency medical services and to include them in all campus drills and exercises. College officials also described partnering with state agencies to develop their emergency plan and identify roles in the event of an emergency, adhere to state requirements, or obtain resources (see text box). Officials at about half of the 18 selected colleges described working with state law enforcement entities to, for example, obtain information about emerging threats, or involve state officials in drills and exercises to practice their colleges’ emergency plans. About half of the college officials also described cases in which they were required by state law or regulation to complete certain college-specific emergency preparedness activities, such as developing an emergency operations plan, although officials from a college emergency preparedness association noted that state requirements related to college emergency preparedness vary widely. In addition to describing requirements from state emergency management agencies, officials from several public colleges described emergency preparedness requirements from the head office of their state’s college system. Other officials said that their state did not have any requirements specific to emergency preparedness at colleges. States sometimes also provided resources for colleges’ preparedness efforts. Officials at most of the 18 colleges we contacted said that they received some state written guidance, training, or technical assistance that was either specifically tailored to colleges, or was designed for various entities including colleges. For example, Colorado has an online school safety center that disseminates emergency preparedness resources and offers technical assistance. An official from the Kansas Board of Regents told us the Board’s staff helps to facilitate a new emergency preparedness community of practice led by colleges, and an official from the state’s Division of Emergency Management said they hold general emergency preparedness trainings in which colleges may participate. In addition to supports from local and state government, officials at most of the selected colleges reported that they received support or assistance from college emergency preparedness associations. For example, these associations host conferences and conduct studies on emergency preparedness. Three College Emergency Managers’ Descriptions of Working with Community Partners Informal networks were essential. People who know each other will help each other. I have a friend in the state police department and requested his assistance with security for the evacuation center. The state police provided approximately 10 troopers to assist the campus police officers. Some evacuees brought their pets with them, so the county office of emergency management activated its animal shelter resources and positioned an animal shelter on campus. Someone brought a 4-foot iguana. What do you do with an iguana? The group that was being destructive moved back and forth between campus and the city, so we communicated and coordinated a lot with community partners. We work together on a daily basis, so the communication that night was seamless. We also had a member of the local police department in our emergency management headquarters during the event, which was very helpful. In the days leading up to Hurricane Irma, statewide briefings were held twice a day with a variety of emergency personnel in the room, including local police and fire chiefs, mayors, power companies, communications personnel, and the state emergency management department. Everyone had already discussed how we would work together in the event of an emergency, so the conversation focused on coordinating specific actions. For example, we are a state system of technical colleges with many tractor-trailer drivers on campus. We were asked to deploy those drivers to deliver supplies to various state and FEMA locations around the state. In addition to managing emergencies for the college, I am also the mayor of one of the local towns and those responsibilities dovetail nicely. Responding to emergencies never becomes second nature, but it’s nice to know that when something natural or manmade strikes, there are systems, people, and assets in place. One of the reasons that the system works so well now is because frameworks like NIMS were put in place after Hurricane Katrina. Various sub-agencies within DHS, DOJ, and Education are involved in developing and providing emergency preparedness resources for colleges (see fig. 1). These three agencies use a variety of methods to provide resources, such as written guidance, webinars, and individual technical assistance (see fig. 2). The content of these resources ranges from general emergency management information to guidance specifically tailored to schools (see text box). Agency officials we interviewed said federal agencies have specific areas of expertise as it relates to college emergency preparedness. For example, DHS’ FEMA provides broad emergency preparedness information and tools and DOJ approaches emergency preparedness through a law enforcement and public safety perspective. Education’s role includes the work of its Federal Student Aid office, which approaches emergency preparedness by issuing relevant guidance, providing technical assistance, and enforcing compliance with the Clery Act. Federal officials noted that colleges can have differing needs when it comes to emergency preparedness, based on their size, funding, and current threats. As a result, agency officials said they strive to provide tailored resources when possible. For example, DHS officials said that the Campus Resilience Program is building a website portal that will include a menu of FEMA resources tailored to colleges’ needs, including a downloadable self-assessment of risk and vulnerability. This new program is meant to expand on a similar pilot program that operated from 2013 to 2016; officials expect it to be accessible to schools midway through fiscal year 2018. Education and DOJ officials said that college officials have recently been requesting information and assistance with demonstrations and large events on campus. Specifically, the DOJ-funded National Center for Campus Public Safety (NCCPS) publicized a “For Official Use Only” report on maintaining safety and order on campuses during protests and demonstrations, which was produced by DHS and DOJ. According to NCCPS tracking records, 325 colleges and other parties requested this guidance from January through August 2017. Additionally, agencies have developed resources based on current events, including webinars in response to a series of severe hurricanes in fall 2017. Examples of Federal Resources for Colleges’ Emergency Preparedness Efforts National Incident Management System: The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides general emergency management resources through its National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS). FEMA officials have also helped produce some college-specific resources within NIMS and ICS, such as a guide for NIMS implementation for colleges, and courses tailored to college officials, including a course titled “Multi-Hazard Emergency Management for Higher Education.” National Center for Campus Public Safety (NCCPS): Funded by the Department of Justice (DOJ), NCCPS maintains a website with a library of resources and training for colleges, and distributes a weekly electronic newsletter to officials who request to be on the distribution list. NCCPS also staffs research associates who answer email requests from college officials. Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance Center: Administered by the Department of Education (Education), the center includes a community of practice, and links to federal resources and training. The REMS Center addresses emergency preparedness for both K-12 schools and colleges; according to officials, the center devotes approximately 20 percent of its resources to emergency preparedness for colleges. 2013 Guide for Developing High-Quality Emergency Operations Plans for Institutions of Higher Education: Developed by Education, DOJ, DHS, and other agencies, this is an overall guide for colleges as they develop their emergency plans. Assistance related to Clery Act components on emergency preparedness: Offices within Education provide guidance (such as the Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting) and assistance with calls to the Campus Safety and Security Help Desk. Examples of Federal Resources for Colleges’ Emergency Preparedness Efforts Campus Resilience Program: As part of this program, the Office of Academic Engagement, within DHS, leads the National Seminar and Tabletop Exercise Series for Institutions of Higher Education, a series of campus-based events where college officials discuss their roles during a simulated emergency situation. DHS officials collaborate with officials from DOJ and other agencies to conduct these events. In 2016, the tabletop exercise focused on responding to campus violence. Campus Liaison Program: Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Campus Liaison Agents, comprised of both Special Agents and Task Force Officers on the Joint Terrorism Task Forces in FBI field offices, provide information, training, exercises, and response capabilities to campus public safety officials. Research and reports on manmade threats: Agencies have published reports on manmade threats applicable to higher education settings, such as the 2010 report “Campus Attacks: Targeted Violence Affecting Institutions of Higher Education,” which was a collaborative among the FBI, Education, and Secret Service. Most of the federal agency officials we interviewed said they were generally aware of resources produced by other federal agencies and reported that collaboration is based on relationships formed through prior collaborative efforts, such as the White House-initiated effort to produce emergency preparedness guidance for colleges in 2013. For example, Education officials described being contacted by their colleagues at other agencies with questions or requests, and DHS and DOJ officials said they frequently cross-promote each other’s resources. Further, various agencies have advisory boards and committees to inform their agency- specific initiatives, such as the DHS Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council, which includes officials from other agencies. However, some agency officials shared potential issues with information sharing. For example, one official said he continues to encounter federal offices that have emergency preparedness resources of which he was unaware, indicating there are continued opportunities for increased collaboration. There is currently no systemic way for federal agencies to share information about resources for college emergency preparedness. Federal officials have established an interagency working group, “Federal Partners in School Emergency Management and Preparedness” that currently focuses on resources for K-12 schools, and Education officials said it plans to expand its focus to include colleges, perhaps by fall 2018. Most federal agency officials we spoke with said having an interagency working group focused on colleges would be useful, for example, to ensure that officials are aware of all available resources across the federal government. Officials from the selected 18 colleges cited mixed levels of awareness regarding federal resources on emergency preparedness developed specifically for them. For example, officials at all 18 colleges said they were aware of FEMA resources focused on general emergency preparedness, such as NIMS. However, we found that college emergency managers were less frequently aware of college-specific resources produced or funded by Education, DOJ, and others. Specifically, college emergency managers at almost half of the selected schools said that they were unaware of each of the following key resources: the 2013 Guide for Developing High-Quality Emergency Operations Plans, the NCCPS website, or Education’s Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance Center website. In addition, the college officials with whom we spoke sometimes requested the federal government develop specific resources without realizing these resources already exist. For example, one college official described wanting resources on how to manage active shooter and weather-related emergencies, although several agencies currently fund or provide such resources. Additionally, another college official who generally accessed federal resources through DHS suggested that the agency develop tailored guidance for colleges beyond NIMS, without realizing that a NIMS guide for colleges exists on Education’s REMS website. Federal officials and representatives from college emergency preparedness associations have also observed gaps in awareness of federal resources among college officials and have acknowledged it as a challenge. For example, one agency official said that every time she goes to a conference, she finds more college officials who have not heard of key federal resources, signaling a continued need for more outreach. A needs assessment funded by DOJ also found that awareness of federal resources may be an issue. Further, NCCPS staff conducted a survey among colleges to assess the level of engagement these schools have with entities such as FBI Campus Liaison Agents, and told us they found about half of colleges—especially private colleges—are unaware of the federal entities included in the survey. This limited awareness among some schools is occurring despite federal agencies’ efforts to disseminate resources and engage with the higher education community. Agencies publicize resources through electronic mailing lists (i.e., listservs), social media, conferences, websites, direct outreach, and college emergency preparedness associations. For example, Education’s Office of Safe and Healthy Students, which publishes its resources on its REMS website, publicizes these resources through social media. DHS publicizes its Campus Resilience Program at conferences. Other agency officials we spoke with said they also use conferences as opportunities to increase school officials’ awareness of federal resources, and they partner with college emergency preparedness associations to publicize their resources. NCCPS includes information on various resources in its weekly e-newsletter. Additionally, following up on the results of the NCCPS survey on colleges’ engagement with FBI Campus Liaison Agents discussed above, NCCPS staff have discussed the results with the FBI Program Manager of the Campus Liaison Program so the FBI can improve engagement with colleges. Officials from colleges, college emergency preparedness associations, and federal agencies we interviewed identified several factors, such as colleges’ staffing resources dedicated to emergency preparedness and the nature of the professional networks used by their emergency managers, that may lead officials to be less familiar with college-specific federal resources on emergency preparedness: Without full-time emergency preparedness staff, colleges, particularly small colleges, must prioritize the most urgent tasks, and thus, officials reported not having enough time to research available federal resources. Representatives from college emergency preparedness associations also said that, in their experience, larger schools were more likely to be aware of federal resources than private and smaller colleges. College emergency managers we spoke with often have backgrounds in local or state emergency preparedness or law enforcement or have networks comprised of local or state officials. These managers often said they learned about federal resources through their more general local and state emergency preparedness networks. As a result, they were more frequently aware of general FEMA resources applicable to these localities versus resources specifically designed for colleges. In particular, college officials we contacted were more likely to report seeking information from DHS than from Education or DOJ. Some college officials may be uninterested in learning about additional resources provided by the federal government, especially if they receive resources from states, localities, or college emergency preparedness associations or potentially in cases where campus leadership does not prioritize emergency preparedness. While agency officials and representatives from college emergency preparedness associations said that federal agencies have made strides in publicizing their resources to a population of college officials that can be challenging to reach, and expressed desire to increase awareness, we identified potential gaps or missed opportunities in their dissemination approaches, including: Agencies commonly publicize new resources through their existing listservs and social media accounts. While these dissemination strategies are effective for alerting colleges already connected to federal agencies, they are less likely to reach additional colleges not already subscribed to these distribution lists. For example, a REMS official reported that the REMS listserv includes approximately 1,000 officials from colleges and related associations. Given that approximately 4,000 colleges were operating in the 2015-2016 school year, according to Education data, most colleges do not receive these electronic communications. In addition, DHS officials told us that one of their college emergency preparedness distribution lists includes representatives from college emergency preparedness associations and state college and university systems, but is not designed to include individual colleges unless they request to be included. Agencies also often publicize their efforts at conferences, but these conferences may miss some colleges, especially some smaller colleges with fewer resources with which to send college officials, according to several agency and college emergency preparedness association officials. As a result, colleges that can afford to send officials to these conferences may already be more informed than colleges not in attendance. In reviewing various federal websites, we found some lists of resources that did not include key federal resources, or included web links that directed visitors to other agencies’ resources that were out of date. For example, one federal website included a list of resources related to emergency planning for colleges, but did not list the NCCPS website among these resources, even though it is a key resource focused on the topic. Another federal website for college emergency preparedness did not include a link to Education’s REMS website, which was specifically developed for school emergency preparedness. Further, this same resource included a link to another Education webpage that was empty of content and had not been updated since 2015. When federal emergency preparedness websites are out of date or incomplete, federal agencies miss opportunities to provide accurate, up-to-date information about their resources and initiatives and those of their partner agencies, and may contribute to colleges’ gaps in awareness about these resources. We heard from several college officials that they would like direct outreach from the federal government. Agencies do not generally distribute information directly to all colleges, especially those not previously signed up for listservs or other distribution services. However, Education has email contact information for the official at every college who reports campus crime statistics to the agency, which may be a natural entry point for federal agencies to disseminate information on emergency preparedness to all colleges. As discussed above, agency officials do not have a systematic method for notifying each other about their resources for colleges. This could limit officials’ ability to cross-publicize each other’s resources; an important activity given that some colleges we contacted only seek information from one agency or website and were unaware of resources from others. According to federal standards for internal control, in communicating information to achieve their objectives, agencies should consider appropriate methods of communication with their external audience (in this case, college emergency managers). Relatedly, these standards also state that agencies should communicate with each other on necessary information for achieving their objectives. Limited awareness of federal resources may result in colleges unnecessarily focusing their limited time and resources on developing strategies or information that federal agencies have already addressed, or advancing preparedness efforts that are not fully informed by federal agencies’ expertise. Emergency preparedness is a vital and challenging task for the higher education community. Various sub-agencies within three key federal agencies—DHS, DOJ, and Education—provide a number of resources for colleges, but over the course of our review, we found that colleges were sometimes unaware of key federal resources that could assist them in meeting their important emergency preparedness needs. The breadth of many colleges’ responsibilities beyond education—such as housing students, running research facilities, and operating hospitals—increases their exposure to risks. Being underprepared in the face of an emergency could dramatically increase both human and economic consequences, not only for the colleges themselves, but also for the larger communities to which they are connected. Emergency preparedness is a shared responsibility and colleges bear some responsibility for learning about federal resources that can assist them in protecting their students and staff. However, striking an appropriate balance between meeting colleges’ main mission—educating students—and other equally important responsibilities, such as emergency preparedness, can be difficult, especially given resource constraints. While federal agencies also face resource constraints, supporting the safety of college community members is an important part of the missions of DHS, DOJ, and Education. These agencies have developed a variety of resources intended to support colleges in their emergency preparedness efforts, but colleges are not always aware of these resources. This problem is exacerbated by federal agencies’ choice of dissemination methods, which could miss a large portion of college emergency managers, and because federal agencies have missed opportunities to cross-promote each other’s resources. Unless federal agencies address these issues, they will continue to miss opportunities to more effectively communicate important information to colleges, particularly those that may be harder to reach, such as smaller schools. The planned interagency working group on emergency preparedness for colleges may offer an opportunity to systematically explore areas in which communication and connection between colleges and federal agencies can be improved, while leveraging and improving existing agency relationships. We are making a total of three recommendations—one to each of the three agencies in our review—to improve awareness of federal resources for emergency preparedness among colleges. Specifically: The Secretary of Education, in collaboration with other agencies through the planned interagency working group or another mechanism, should identify further opportunities to more effectively publicize resources to reach additional colleges. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with other agencies, through the planned interagency working group or another mechanism, should identify further opportunities to more effectively publicize resources to reach additional colleges. (Recommendation 2) The Attorney General, in collaboration with other agencies through the planned interagency working group or another mechanism, should identify further opportunities to more effectively publicize resources to reach additional colleges. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to Education, DHS, and DOJ for each agency’s review and comment. All three agencies agreed with our recommendations or described steps they would take to implement them. Education’s written comments are reproduced in appendix I and DHS’ written comments are reproduced in appendix II. DOJ did not provide written comments. DHS and DOJ provided technical comments. We incorporated changes based on their comments into the report, as appropriate. Education stated that the agency is always interested in increasing utilization by colleges of the emergency management resources that the Department and other federal agencies develop. It also stated that the planned interagency working group would be a very appropriate and effective vehicle for increasing utilization of these resources, and that it will consider that group or other mechanisms to identify further opportunities to publicize resources to colleges. DHS concurred with our recommendation to the agency and said that it would continue to collaborate with its partners to further publicize resources available to colleges. It also highlighted several of the Department’s current and planned resources for its related Campus Resilience Program. DOJ did not provide written comments, but stated that it agreed with our recommendation to the agency. Officials stated that they would outline steps for addressing the recommendation in future communications. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.

A number of federal agencies, including DHS, DOJ, and Education, offer resources to support these efforts. GAO was asked to review colleges' awareness of these resources. This report examines how (1) selected colleges prepare for emergencies, and (2) federal agencies support college emergency preparedness efforts, including the extent to which selected colleges reported awareness of federal resources. To answer these questions, GAO interviewed officials from a non-generalizable sample of 18 colleges selected for diversity in size, type, and location. GAO also interviewed officials from three states (Colorado, Kansas, and Virginia) in which some of these schools operated. The states were selected to represent varied approaches to supporting colleges' emergency preparedness efforts. GAO also reviewed federal emergency preparedness resources, agency written responses, applicable federal laws, and federal internal control standards, and interviewed federal officials and representatives from several associations recommended by agency officials. Emergency managers at 18 colleges across the country told GAO that their efforts to prepare for emergencies involved working with the campus community to develop, communicate, and practice plans, as well as working with state and local partners. Campus community members who are involved often include personnel from offices such as public safety, student affairs, or facilities. Officials at all 18 colleges reported developing emergency plans addressing a range of potential events—an approach consistent with federal emergency management principles. To publicize plans, officials often reported using websites, text messages, or presentations to the campus community. Colleges also reported practicing plans through drills. College officials noted that buy-in from the college president and other top campus leaders was critical to their efforts; several officials reported struggling to obtain such support. Most officials also said they coordinate with local or state partners such as police and relied on these partners for advice or to obtain emergency preparedness resources. The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Education (Education) offer a variety of emergency preparedness resources to colleges (see figure). However, officials GAO interviewed at 18 colleges described mixed awareness of federal resources, especially those specifically tailored to colleges, despite federal efforts to publicize these resources in a variety of ways. Federal officials and other stakeholders acknowledged this mixed awareness and identified potential causes, such as college emergency managers having networks comprised of local officials who are more likely to know about federal resources for local agencies versus those for colleges, or some college officials devoting limited time to researching federal resources for various reasons. DHS, DOJ, and Education all publicize their resources through electronic mailing lists, websites, or other methods, but GAO identified missed opportunities in their dissemination approaches. For example, the electronic mailing list for one key resource may reach the approximately 1,000 officials from colleges subscribed, but may miss at least 3,000 additional schools. GAO also found two federal agency websites that did not include key resources from other federal agencies. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should consider the most appropriate methods for communicating with their external audiences. By identifying opportunities to improve dissemination, federal agencies may increase their ability to effectively communicate important information to colleges. GAO recommends that DHS, DOJ, and Education work together to identify opportunities to more effectively publicize emergency preparedness resources to colleges. All three agencies concurred with the recommendations or described actions to implement them."], "length": 6898, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f0cd9b760455bba1fbd2ff38eab1ac00e91b350fcf0fcb80"}
{"input": "", "context": "The Bureau’s address canvassing operation updates its address list and maps, which are the foundation of the decennial census. An accurate address list both identifies all households that are to receive a notice by mail requesting participation in the census (by Internet, phone, or mailed- in questionnaire) and serves as the control mechanism for following up with households that fail to respond to the initial request. Precise maps are critical for counting the population in the proper locations—the basis of congressional apportionment and redistricting. Our prior work has shown that developing an accurate address list is challenging—in part because people can reside in unconventional dwellings, such as converted garages, basements, and other forms of hidden housing. For example, as shown in figure 1, what appears to be a single-family house could contain an apartment, as suggested by its two doorbells. During address canvassing, the Bureau verifies that its master address list and maps are accurate to ensure the tabulation for all housing units and group quarters is correct. For the 2010 Census, the address canvassing operation mobilized almost 150,000 field workers to canvass almost every street in the United States and Puerto Rico to update the Bureau’s address list and map data—and in 2012 reported the cost at nearly $450 million. The cost of going door-to-door in 2010, along with the emerging availability of imagery data, led the Bureau to explore an approach for 2020 address canvassing that would allow for fewer boots on the ground. Traditionally, the Bureau went door-to-door to homes across the country to verify addresses. This “in-field address canvassing” is a labor-intensive and expensive operation. To achieve cost savings, in September 2014 the Bureau decided to use a reengineered approach for building its address list for the 2020 Census and not go door-to-door (or “in-field”) across the country, as it has in prior decennial censuses. Rather, some areas (known as “blocks”) would only need a review of their address and map information using computer imagery and third-party data sources— what the Bureau calls “in-office” address canvassing procedures. According to the Bureau’s address canvassing operational plan, in-office canvassing had two phases: During the first phase, known as “Interactive Review,” Bureau employees use current aerial imagery to determine if areas have housing changes, such as new residential developments or repurposed structures, or if the areas match what is in the Bureau’s master address file. The Bureau assesses the extent to which the number of housing units in the master address file is consistent with the number of units visible in the current imagery. If the housing shown in the imagery matches what is listed in the master address file, then those areas are considered to be resolved or stable and would not be canvassed in-field. During the second phase, known as “Active Block Resolution,” employees would try to resolve coverage concerns identified during the first phase and verify every housing unit by virtually canvassing the entire area. As part of this virtual canvass, the Bureau would compare what is found in imagery to the master address file data and other data sources in an attempt to resolve any discrepancies. If Bureau employees still could not reconcile the discrepancies, such as housing unit count or street locations with what is on the address list, then they would refer these blocks to in-field address canvassing. However, in March 2017, citing budget uncertainty the Bureau decided to discontinue the second phase of in-office review for the 2020 Census. According to the Bureau, in order to ensure that the operations implemented in the 2018 End-to-End Test were consistent with operations planned for the 2020 Census, the Bureau added the blocks originally resolved during the second phase of in-office review back into the in-field workload for the test. The cancellation of Active Block Resolution is expected to increase the national workload of the in-field canvassing workload by 5 percentage points (25 percent to 30 percent). During in-field address canvassing, listers use laptop computers to compare what they see on the ground to what is on the address list and map. Listers confirm, add, delete, or move addresses to their correct map positions. At each housing unit, listers are trained to speak with a knowledgeable resident to confirm or update address data, ask about hidden housing units, confirm the housing unit location on the map, (known as the map spot) and collect a map spot using global positioning systems (GPS). If no one is available, listers are to use house numbers and street signs to verify the address data. The data are transmitted electronically to the Bureau. The Census Bureau expects that the End-to-End Test for address canvassing will identify areas for improvement and changes that need to be made for the 2020 Census. Our prior work has shown the importance of robust testing. Rigorous testing is a critical risk mitigation strategy because it provides information on the feasibility and performance of individual census-taking activities, their potential for achieving desired results, and the extent to which they are able to function together under full operational conditions. In February 2017, we added the 2020 Census to GAO’s High-Risk List because operational and other issues are threatening the Bureau’s ability to deliver a cost-effective enumeration. We reported on concerns about the Bureau’s capacity to implement innovative census-taking methods, uncertainties surrounding critical information technology systems, and the quality of the Bureau’s cost-estimates. Underlying these issues are challenges in such essential management functions as the Bureau’s ability to: collect and use real-time indicators of cost, performance, and schedule; follow leading practices for cost estimation; scheduling; risk management; IT acquisition, development, testing, and security; and cost-effectively deal with contingencies including, for example, fiscal constraints, potential changes in design, and natural disasters. The Bureau completed in-field address canvassing as scheduled by September 29, 2017, canvassing approximately 340,400 addresses. Most of the listers we observed generally followed procedures. For example, 15 of 18 listers knocked on doors, and 16 of 18 looked for hidden housing units, which is important for establishing that address lists and maps are accurate and for identifying hard-to-count populations. Those procedures include taking such steps as: comparing the housing units they see on the “ground” to the housing units on the address list, knocking on all doors so they could speak with a resident to confirm the address (even if the address is visible on the mailbox or house) and to confirm that there are no other living quarters such as a basement apartment, looking for “hidden housing units”, looking for group quarters such as group homes or dormitories, and confirming the location of the housing unit on a map with GPS coordinates collected on the doorstep. To the extent procedures were not followed, it generally occurred when listers did not go up to the door and speak with a resident or take a map spot on the doorstep. Failure to follow procedures could adversely affect a complete count, as addresses could be missed or a group quarter could be misclassified as a residential address. After we alerted the Bureau to our observations, the Bureau agreed moving forward, to emphasize the importance of following procedures during training for in-field address canvassing. Address canvassing has tight time frames, so work needs to be assigned efficiently. Sometimes this means the Bureau needs to reassign work from one lister to another. During address canvassing, the Bureau discovered that reassigned census blocks sometimes would appear in both the new and the original listers’ work assignments. In some cases, this led to blocks being worked more than once, which decreased efficiency, increased costs, and could create confusion and credibility issues when two different listers visit a house. According to Bureau procedures, listers were instructed to connect to the Bureau’s Mobile Case Management (MCM) system to download work assignments (address blocks) and to transmit their completed work at the beginning and end of the work day but not during the work day. Thus during the work day, they were unaware when unworked blocks had been reassigned to another lister. Bureau officials also told us that the Listing and Mapping Application (LiMA) software used to update the address file and maps was supposed to have the functionality to prevent blocks from being worked more than once, but this functionality was not developed because of budget cuts. For 2020, Bureau officials told us they plan to create operational procedures for reassigning work. According to Bureau officials, they plan to require supervisors to contact the original lister when work is reassigned. We have requested a copy of those procedures; however, the Bureau has not finalized them. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Standards for Internal Control) call for management to design control activities, such as policies and procedures to achieve objectives. Finalizing these procedures should help prevent blocks from being canvassed more than once. The Bureau conducts tests under census-like conditions, in part, to verify 2020 Census planning assumptions, such as workload, how many houses per hour a lister can verify (also known as a lister’s productivity rate), and how many people the Bureau needs to hire for an operation. Moreover, one of the objectives of the test is to validate that the operations being tested are ready at the scale needed for the 2020 Census. For the 2018 End-to-End Test, the Bureau completed in-field address canvassing on time at two sites and early at one site; despite workload increases at all three test sites and hiring shortfalls at two sites. The Bureau credits this success to better than expected productivity. As the Bureau reviews the results of address canvassing, evaluating the factors that affected workload, productivity rates, and staffing and making adjustments to its estimates, if necessary, before the 2020 Census would help the Bureau ensure that address canvassing has the appropriate number of staff and equipment to complete the work in the required time frame. For the 2020 Census, the Bureau estimates it will have to send 30 percent of addresses to the field for listers to verify. However, at the three test sites, the workload was higher than this estimate (see table 1). At one test site, the percent of addresses verified through in-field address canvassing was 76 percent or 46 percentage points more than the Bureau’s expected 2020 Census in-field address canvassing workload estimate of 30 percent. Bureau officials told us that the 30 percent in-field workload estimate is a national average and is not specific to any of the three test sites. Prior to the test, officials said that the Bureau also knew that the West Virginia site was assigning new addresses to some of the test site’s housing units due to local government emergency 911 address conversion and that the in-field workload would be greater in West Virginia when compared to the other test sites. We requested documentation for the Bureau’s original estimate that 30 percent of the 133.8 million expected addresses would be canvassed in- field for the 2020 Census. However, the Bureau was unable to provide us with documentation to support how they arrived at the 30 percent estimate. Instead, the Bureau provided us with a November 2017 methodology document that showed three in-field address canvassing workload scenarios, whereby, between 41.9 and 45.1 percent of housing units would need to go to the field for address canvassing. The three scenarios consider a range of stability in the address file as well as different workload estimates for in-field follow-up. At 30 percent the Bureau would need to canvass about 40.2 million addresses; however, at 41.9 and 45.1 percent the Bureau would need to canvass between 56 million and 60.4 million addresses, respectively. According to Bureau officials, they are continuing to assess whether changes to its in-office address canvassing procedures would be able to reduce the in-field address canvassing workload to 30 percent, while at the same time maintaining address quality. However, Bureau officials did not provide us with documentation to show how the in-field address canvassing workload would be reduced because the proposed changes were still being reviewed internally. Workload for address canvassing directly affects cost – the greater the workload the more people as well as laptop computers needed to carry out the operation. We found that the 30 percent workload threshold is what is reflected in the December 2017 updated 2020 Census cost estimate that was used to support the fiscal year 2019 budget request. Thus, if the 30 percent threshold is not achieved then the in-field canvassing workload will likely increase for the 2020 Census and the Bureau would be at risk of exceeding its proposed budget for the address canvassing operation. Standards for Internal Control call for organizations to use quality information to achieve their objectives. Thus, continuing to evaluate and finalize workload estimates for in-field address canvassing with the most current information will help ensure the Bureau is well-positioned to conduct addressing canvassing for the 2020 Census. For example, according to Bureau officials, preliminary workload estimates will need to be delivered by January 2019 for hiring purposes and the final in-field workload numbers for address canvassing will need to be determined by June 2019 for the start of address canvassing, which is set to begin in August 2019. Moreover, by February 2019 the Bureau’s schedule calls for it to determine how many laptops will be needed to conduct 2020 Census address canvassing. At the test sites, listers were substantially more productive than the Bureau expected. The expected production rate is defined as the number of addresses expected to be completed per hour, and it affects the cost of the address canvassing operation. This rate includes time for actions other than actually updating addresses, such as travel time. In the 2010 Census the rates reflected different geographic areas, and the country was subdivided into three areas: urban/suburban, rural, and very rural. According to Bureau officials, for the 2020 Census the Bureau will have variable production rates based on geography, similar to the design used in the 2010 Census. The Bureau told us they have not finalized the 2020 Census address canvassing production rates. Table 2 shows the expected and actual productivity rates (addresses per hour) for the in-field address canvassing operation at all three test sites. To ensure address canvassing for the test was consistent with the 2020 Census, Bureau officials told us they included the blocks resolved during the now discontinued second phase of in-office review, into the in-field workload for the test. The Bureau attributed the greater productivity to this discontinued second phase. Bureau officials told us that they believe that listers spent less time updating those blocks because they had already been resolved, and any necessary changes were already incorporated. Moreover, while benefitting from the second phase of in-office address canvassing may be one explanation for why listers were more productive. Bureau officials told us that they are unable to evaluate the differences in expected versus actual productivity for blocks added to the workload as a result of the discontinued second phase because of limitations with the data. However, there could be other reasons as well such as travel time and geography. Standards for Internal Control require that organizations use quality information to achieve their objectives. Therefore, continuing to evaluate other factors from the 2018 End-to-End Test that may have increased or could potentially decrease productivity will be important for informing lister productivity rates for 2020, as productivity affects the number of listers needed to carry out the operation, the number of staff hours charged to the operation, and the number of laptops to be procured. For the 2018 End-to-End Test address canvassing operation, the Bureau hired fewer listers than it assumed it needed at two sites and hired more at the other site. In West Virginia, 60 percent of the required field staff was hired and in Washington, 74.5 percent of the required field staff was hired. Nevertheless, the operation finished on schedule at both these sites. In contrast in Rhode Island the Bureau hired 112 percent of the required field staff and finished early. According to Bureau officials, both the West Virginia and Washington state test sites started hiring field staff later than expected because of uncertainty surrounding whether the Bureau would have sufficient funding to open all three test sites for the 2018 End-to-End Test. When a decision was made to open all three sites for the address canvassing operation only, that decision came late, and Bureau officials told us that once they were behind in hiring and were never able to catch up because of low unemployment rates and the short duration of the operation. According to Bureau officials, their approach to hiring for the 2018 End-to-End Test was similar to that used for the 2010 and 2000 Censuses. In both censuses the Bureau’s goal was to recruit and hire more workers than it needed because of immutable deadlines and attrition. After the 2010 Census we reported that the Bureau had over recruited; conversely, for the 2000 Census the Bureau had recruited in the midst of one of the tightest labor markets in three decades. Thus we recommended, and the Bureau agreed to evaluate current economic factors that are associated with and predictive of employee interest in census work, such as national and regional unemployment levels, and use these available data to determine the potential temporary workforce pool and adjust its recruiting approach. The Bureau implemented this recommendation, and used unemployment and 2010 Census data to determine a base recruiting goal at both the Los Angeles, California and Houston, Texas 2016 census test sites. Specifically, the recruiting goal for Los Angeles was reduced by 30 percent. Bureau officials told us that it continues to gather staffing data from the 2018 End-to-End Test that will be important to consider looking forward to 2020. Although address canvassing generally finished on schedule even while short staffed, Bureau officials told us they are carefully monitoring recruiting and hiring data to ensure they have sufficient staff for the test’s next census field operation non-response follow-up, when census workers go door-to-door to follow up with housing units that have not responded. Non-response follow-up is set to begin in May 2018. According to test data as of March 2018, the Bureau is short of its recruiting goal for this operation which is being conducted in Providence County, Rhode Island. The Bureau’s goal is to recruit 5,300 census workers and as of March 2018, the Bureau had only recruited 2,732 qualified applicants to fill 1,166 spots for training and deploy 1,049 census workers to conduct non-response follow-up. Bureau officials told us they believe that low unemployment is making it difficult to meet its recruiting goals in Providence County, Rhode Island, but they are confident they will be able to hire sufficient staff without having to increase pay rates. Recruiting and retaining sufficient staff to carry out operations as labor- intensive as address canvassing and nonresponse follow-up for the 2020 Census is a huge undertaking with implications for cost and accuracy. Therefore, striking the right staffing balance for the 2020 Census is important for ensuring deadlines are met and costs are controlled. Bureau officials told us that during the test 11 out of 330 laptop computers did not properly transmit address and map data collected for 25 blocks. The lister-collected address file and map data are supposed to be electronically transmitted from the listers’ laptops to the Bureau’s data processing center in Jeffersonville, Indiana. The data are encrypted and remain on the laptop until the laptops are returned to the Bureau where the encrypted data are deleted. Prior to learning that not all data had properly transmitted off the laptops, data on seven of the laptops was deleted. Data on the remaining four laptops were still available. In Providence, Rhode Island, where the full test will take place, the Bureau recanvassed blocks where data were lost to ensure that the address and map information for nonresponse follow-up was correct. Recanvassing blocks increases costs and can lead to credibility problems for the Bureau when listers visit a home twice. Going into address canvassing for the End-to-End Test, Bureau officials said they knew there was a problem with the LiMA software used to update the Bureau’s address lists and maps. Specifically, address and map updates would not always transfer when a lister transmitted their completed work assignments from the laptop to headquarters. Other census surveys using LiMA had also encountered the same software problem. Moreover, listers were not aware that data had not transmitted because there was no system-generated warning. Bureau officials are working to fix the LiMA software problem, but told us that the software problem has been persistent across other census surveys that use LiMA and they are not certain it will be fixed. Bureau officials told us that prior to the start of address canvassing they created an alert report to notify Bureau staff managing the operation at headquarters if data were not properly transmitted. When transmission problems were reported, staff was supposed to remotely retrieve the data that were not transmitted. This workaround was designed to safeguard the data but according to officials was not used. Bureau officials told us that they do not know whether this was because the alert reports were not viewed by responsible staff or whether the alert report to notify the Bureau staff managing the operation was not triggered. Bureau officials told us they recognize the importance of following procedures to monitor alert reports, and acknowledge that the loss of data on seven of the laptops may have been avoided had the procedures that alert reports get triggered and monitored been followed; however, officials did not know why the procedures were not followed. For 2020, if the software problem is not resolved, then officials said the Bureau plans to create two new alert reports to monitor the transmission of data. One report would be triggered when the problem occurs and a second report would capture a one-to-one match between data on the laptop and data transmitted to the data center so that discrepancies would be immediately obvious. While these new reports should help ensure that Bureau staff are alerted when data has not properly transmitted, the Bureau has not determined and addressed why the procedures that required an alert report get triggered and then reviewed by Bureau staff did not work as intended. Standards for Internal Control require that organizations safeguard data and follow policies and procedures to achieve their objectives. Thus, either fixing the LiMA software problem, or if the software problem cannot be fixed, then determining and addressing why procedures that alert reports get triggered and monitored were not followed would position the Bureau to help prevent future data losses. To effectively manage address canvassing, the Bureau needs to be able to monitor the operation’s progress in near real time. Operational issues such as listers not working assigned hours or falling behind schedule need to be resolved quickly because of the tight time frames of the address canvassing and subsequent operations. During the address canvassing test, the Bureau encountered several challenges that hindered its efforts to efficiently monitor lister activities as well as the progress of the address canvassing operation. The Bureau provides data-driven tools for the census field supervisors to manage listers, including system alerts that identify issues that require the supervisor to follow-up with a lister. For the address canvassing operation, the system could generate 14 action codes that covered a variety of operational issues such as unusually high or low productivity (which may be a sign of fraud or failure to follow procedures) and administrative issues such as compliance with overtime and completion of expense reports and time cards. During the operation, over 8,250 alerts were sent to CFSs or about 13 alerts were sent per day per CFS. Each alert requires the CFS to take action and then record how the alert was resolved. CFSs told us and the Bureau during debriefing sessions that they believed many of the administrative alerts were erroneous and they dismissed them. For example, during our site visit one CFS showed us an alert that incorrectly identified that a timecard had not been completed. The CFS then showed us that the lister’s timecard had indeed been properly completed and submitted. CFSs we spoke to said that they often dismissed alerts related to expense reports and timecards and did not pay attention to them or manage them. Bureau officials reported that one CFS was fired for not using the alerts to properly manage the operation. To assist supervisors, these alerts need to be reliable and properly used. Bureau officials said that they examined alerts for errors after we told them about our observation. They reported that they did not find any errors in the alerts. They believe that CFSs may not fully understand that the alerts stay active until they are marked as resolved by the CFS. For example, if a CFS gets an alert that a lister has not completed a timecard the alert will remain active until the CFS resolves the alert by stating the time card was completed. The Bureau’s current CFS manual does not address that by the time a CFS sees the alert a lister may have already taken action to resolve it. Because this was a reoccurring situation, CFSs told us they had a difficult time managing the alerts. Standards for Internal Control call for an agency to use quality information to achieve objectives. Bureau officials acknowledge that it is a problem that some CFSs view the alerts as erroneous and told us they plan to address the importance of alerts in training. We spoke to Bureau officials about making the alerts more useful to CFSs, such as by differentiating between critical and noncritical alerts and streamlining alerts by perhaps combining some of them. Bureau officials told us they would monitor the alerts during the 2018 End-to-End Test’s nonresponse follow-up operation and make adjustments if appropriate. However, while the Bureau told us it will monitor alerts for the non-response follow-up operation, the Bureau does not have a plan for how it will examine and make alerts more useful. Ensuring alerts are properly followed up on is critical to the oversight and management of an operation. If the CFSs view the alerts as unreliable, they could be likely to miss key indicators of fraud such as unusually high or low productivity or an unusually high or low number of miles driven. Moreover, monitoring overtime alerts and the submission of daily time cards and expense reports is also important to ensure that overtime is appropriately approved before worked and that listers get paid on time. Another tool the Bureau uses to monitor operations is its Unified Tracking System (UTS), a management dashboard that combines data from a variety of Census systems, bringing the data to one place where the users can run or create reports. It was designed to track metrics such as the number and percentage of blocks assigned and blocks completed as well as the actual expenditures of an operation compared to the budgeted expenditures. However, information in UTS was not always accurate during address canvassing. For example UTS did not always report the correct number of addresses assigned and completed by site. As a result, Bureau managers reported they did not rely on UTS and instead used data from the source systems that fed into it. Bureau officials agreed that inaccurate data is a problem and that this workaround was inefficient as users had to take extra time to go to multiple systems to get the correct data. Bureau officials reported problems importing information from the feeder systems into UTS because of data mismatches. They said that address canvassing event codes were not processed sequentially, as they should have been, which led to inaccurate reporting. Bureau officials told us that they did not specify that the codes needed to be processed in chronological order as part of the requirements for UTS. Bureau officials said UTS passed the requisite readiness reviews and tests. However, Bureau officials also acknowledged that some of these problems could have been caught by exception testing which was not done prior to production. To resolve this issue for 2020, Bureau officials stated they are developing new requirements for UTS to automatically consider the chronological order of event codes. The Bureau told us they are working on these UTS requirements and will provide us with documentation when they are complete. They also said the Bureau plans to implement a process which compares field management reports with UTS reports to help ensure that the reports have the same definitions and are reporting accurate information. Standards for Internal Control call for an organization’s data be complete and accurate and processed into quality information to achieve their objectives. Thus, finalizing UTS requirements for the address canvassing reporting should help increase efficiency for the 2020 Census by avoiding time consuming workarounds. The Bureau has taken significant steps to use technology to reduce census costs. These steps include using electronic systems to transmit listers’ assignments and address and map data. However, during the address canvassing test, several listers and CFSs at the three test sites experienced problems with Internet connections primarily during training. The West Virginia site, which was more rural than the other sites, experienced the most problems with Internet connectivity. All six West Virginia CFSs reported Internet connectivity problems during the operation. As a work around, CFSs told us that a couple of their listers transmitted their work assignments from libraries where they could access the Internet. Bureau officials stated that the laptops in the 2018 End-to-End Test only used two broadband Internet service providers, which may have contributed to some of the Internet access issues. Bureau officials added that despite the reported Internet connectivity issues, the 2018 End-to- End Test for address canvassing finished on schedule and without any major problems. While this might be true for the test, we have previously reported that minor problems can become big challenges when the census scales up to the entire nation. Therefore, it is important that these issues get resolved before August 2019 when in-field address canvassing for the 2020 Census is set to begin. The Bureau is analyzing the cellular network coverage across all 2020 Census areas using coverage maps and other methods to determine which carrier is appropriate (including a backup carrier) for geographic areas where network coverage is limited. According to Bureau officials, they anticipate identifying the cellular carriers for each of its 248 area census offices by the summer of 2018. The officials said they are considering both national and regional carriers to provide service in some geographic areas because the best service provider in a certain geographic area may not be one of the national providers, but a regional provider. In those cases, listers and other staff in those areas will receive devices with the regional carrier. According to Bureau officials, for the 2020 Census, the ability to access multiple carriers should provide field staff with better connectivity around the country. We also found that there was no guidance for listers and CFSs on what to do if they experienced Internet connectivity problems and were unable to access the Internet. Bureau officials told us that staff in the field can use different methods to access the Internet, such as using home wireless networks or mobile hotspots located at libraries, or coffee shops to transmit data. However, the Bureau did not provide such instructions to listers. In addition, the Bureau also does not define what constitutes a secure Internet public connection. Ensuring data are safeguarded is important because census data are confidential. Bureau officials told us that the Bureau plans to provide instructions to field staff on what to do if they are unable to access census systems and what constitutes a secure Internet connection for the next 2018 End-to-End Test field operation, non-response follow-up. However, the Bureau has not finalized or documented these instructions. Standards for Internal Control call for management to design control activities, such as providing instructions to employees to achieve objectives. Finalizing these instructions to field staff will help ensure listers have complete information on how to handle problems with Internet connectivity and that data are securely transmitted. Some listers had difficulty accessing the Internet to take online training for address canvassing. This is the first decennial census that the Bureau is using online training, in previous decennials training was instructor-led in a class room. According to the Bureau, in addition to the Bureau provided laptop, listers also needed a personal home computer or laptop and Internet access at their home in order to complete the training. However, while the Bureau reported that listers had access to a personal computer to complete the training, we found some listers did not have access to the Internet at their home and were forced to find workarounds to access the training. According to American Community Survey data from 2015, among all households, 77 percent had a broadband Internet subscription. Bureau officials told us they are aware that not all households have access to the Internet and that the Bureau’s field division is working on back-up plans for accessing online training. Specifically, Bureau officials told us for 2020 they plan to identify areas of the country that could potentially have connectivity issues and plan to identify alternative locations such as libraries or community centers where Internet connections are available to ensure all staff has access to training. However, they have not finalized those plans to identify locations for training sites. Standards for Internal Control call for management to design control activities, such as having plans in place to achieve objectives. Finalizing these plans to identify alternative training locations will help ensure listers have a place to access training. The Bureau’s re-engineered approach for address canvassing shows promise for controlling costs and maintaining accuracy. However, the address canvassing operation in the 2018 End-to-End test identified the need to reexamine assumptions and make some procedural and technological improvements. For example, at a time when plans for in- field address canvassing should be almost finalized, the Bureau is in the process of evaluating workload and productivity assumptions to ensure sufficient staff are hired and that enough laptop computers are procured. Moreover, Bureau officials have not finalized (1) procedures for reassigning work from one lister to another to prevent the unnecessary duplication of work assignments, (2) instructions for using the Internet when connectivity is a problem to ensure listers have access to training and the secure transmission of data to and from the laptops, and (3) plans for alternate training locations. To ensure address and map data are not lost during transmission, Bureau officials will also need to either (1) fix the problem with the LiMA software used to update the address and map files or (2) determine and address why procedures that alert reports be triggered and monitored were not followed. Finally, the Bureau has made progress in using data driven technology to manage address canvassing operations. However, ensuring data used by supervisors to oversee and monitor operations are both useful and accurate will help field supervisors take appropriate action to address supervisor alerts and will help managers monitor the real-time progress of the address canvassing operation. With little time remaining it will be important to resolve these issues. Making these improvements will better ensure address canvassing for the actual enumeration, beginning in August 2019, fully functions as planned and achieves desired results. We are making the following seven recommendations to the Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau: Secretary of Commerce should ensure the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau continues to evaluate and finalize workload estimates for in-field address canvassing as well as evaluates the factors that impacted productivity rates during the 2018 End-to-End Test and, if necessary, make changes to workload and productivity assumptions before the 2020 Census in-field address canvassing operation to help ensure that assumptions that impact staffing and the number of laptops to be procured are accurate. (Recommendation 1) Secretary of Commerce should ensure the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau finalizes procedures for reassigning blocks to prevent the duplication of work. (Recommendation 2) Secretary of Commerce should ensure the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau finalizes backup instructions for the secure transmission of data when the Bureau’s contracted mobile carriers are unavailable. (Recommendation 3) Secretary of Commerce should ensure the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau finalizes plans for alternate training locations in areas where Internet access is a barrier to completing training. (Recommendation 4) Secretary of Commerce should ensure the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau takes action to either fix the software problem that prevented the successful transmission of data, or if that cannot be fixed, then determine and address why procedures that alert reports be triggered and monitored were not followed. (Recommendation 5) Secretary of Commerce should ensure the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau develops a plan to examine how to make CFS alerts more useful so that CFSs take appropriate action, including alerts a CFS determines are no longer valid because of timing differences. (Recommendation 6) Secretary of Commerce should ensure the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau finalizes UTS requirements for address canvassing reporting to ensure that the data used by census managers who are responsible for monitoring real-time progress of address canvassing are accurate before the 2020 Census. (Recommendation 7) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Commerce. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I the Department of Commerce agreed with our recommendations. The Census Bureau also provided technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Commerce, the Under Secretary of Economic Affairs, the Acting Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, and interested congressional committees. The report also will be available at no charge on GAO’s website at http://www.gao.gov. If you have any questions about this report please contact me at (202) 512-2757 or goldenkoffr@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff that made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. In addition to the contact named above, Lisa Pearson, Assistant Director; Kate Wulff, Analyst-in-Charge; Mark Abraham; Devin Braun; Karen Cassidy; Robert Gebhart; Richard Hung; Kirsten Lauber; Krista Loose; Ty Mitchell; Kayla Robinson; Kate Sharkey; Stewart Small; Jon Ticehurst; and Timothy Wexler made key contributions to this report.", "answers": ["The success of the decennial census depends in large part on the Bureau's ability to locate every household in the United States. To accomplish this monumental task, the Bureau must maintain accurate address and map information for every location where a person could reside. For the 2018 End-to-End Test, census workers known as listers went door-to-door to verify and update address lists and associated maps in selected areas of three test sites—Bluefield-Beckley-Oak Hill, West Virginia; Pierce County, Washington; and Providence County, Rhode Island. GAO was asked to review in-field address canvassing during the End-to-End Test. This report determines whether key address listing activities functioned as planned during the End-to-End Test and identifies any lessons learned that could inform pending decisions for the 2020 Census. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed key documents including test plans and training manuals, as well as workload, productivity and hiring data. At the three test sites, GAO observed listers conducting address canvassing. The Census Bureau (Bureau) recently completed in-field address canvassing for the 2018 End-to-End Test. GAO found that field staff known as listers generally followed procedures when identifying and updating the address file; however, some address blocks were worked twice by different listers because the Bureau did not have procedures for reassigning work from one lister to another while listers work offline. Bureau officials told GAO that they plan to develop procedures to avoid duplication but these procedures have not been finalized. Duplicating work decreases efficiency and increases costs. GAO also found differences between actual and projected data for workload, lister productivity, and hiring. For the 2020 Census, the Bureau estimates it will have to verify 30 percent of addresses in the field. However, at the test sites, the actual workload ranged from 37 to 76 percent of addresses. Bureau officials told GAO the 30 percent was a nationwide average and not site specific; however, the Bureau could not provide documentation to support the 30 percent workload estimate. At all three test sites listers were significantly more productive than expected possibly because a design change provided better quality address and map data in the field, according to the Bureau. Hiring, however, lagged behind Bureau goals. For example, at the West Virginia site hiring was only at 60 percent of its goal. Bureau officials attributed the shortfall to a late start and low unemployment rates. Workload and productivity affect the cost of address canvassing. The Bureau has taken some steps to evaluate factors affecting its estimates, but continuing to so would help the Bureau refine its assumptions to better manage the operation's cost and hiring. Listers used laptops to connect to the Internet and download assignments. They worked offline and went door-to-door to update the address file, then reconnected to the Internet to transmit their completed assignments. Bureau officials told GAO that during the test 11 out of 330 laptops did not properly transmit address and map data collected for 25 blocks. Data were deleted on 7 laptops. Because the Bureau had known there was a problem with software used to transmit address data, it created an alert report to notify the Bureau staff if data were not properly transmitted. However, Bureau officials said that either responsible staff did not follow procedures to look at the alert reports or the reports were not triggered. The Bureau is working to fix the software problem and develop new alert reports, but has not yet determined and addressed why these procedures were not followed. The Bureau's data management reporting system did not always provide accurate information because of a software issue. The system was supposed to pull data from several systems to create a set of real-time cost and progress reports for managers to use. Because the data were not accurate, Bureau staff had to rely on multiple systems to manage address canvassing. The Bureau agreed that not only is inaccurate data problematic, but that creating workarounds is inefficient. The Bureau is developing new requirements to ensure data are accurate but these requirements have not been finalized. GAO is making seven recommendations to the Department of Commerce and Bureau including to: (1) finalize procedures for reassigning work, (2) continue to evaluate workload and productivity data, (3) fix software problem, or determine and address why procedures were not followed, and (4) finalize report requirements to ensure data are accurate. The Department of Commerce agreed with GAO's recommendations, and the Bureau provided technical comments that were incorporated, as appropriate."], "length": 7173, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bdbebb2c94702c393b619f9146005d58fe1291474800355f"}
{"input": "", "context": "Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act which created TSA as the federal agency responsible for security in all modes of transportation, including civil aviation. Among its responsibilities, TSA must generally ensure that all passengers and property are screened before being transported on a commercial passenger aircraft. This statute also provided TSA the authority to enter into OTAs. TSA defines an OTA as a set of legally enforceable promises between TSA and another party that is other than a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, lease, or loan. Every agency has inherent authority to enter into contracts to procure goods or services for its own use; however, agencies must receive specific authority to award OTAs. Under these authorities, agencies may develop agreements that do not follow a standard format or include terms and conditions that are typically required when using traditional mechanisms such as FAR-based contracts. Agreements entered into using other transaction authority are not generally subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements related to government contracting such as the FAR and the terms and conditions of each individual OTA may be tailored to meet the specific situation. For example, OTAs may be fixed-price, cost-reimbursable, or provide that each party bear the costs of their participation. In addition, the length of an OTA is negotiable, with some agreements lasting a few days and others for years. As we reported in 2016, Congress has granted other transaction authority to 11 federal agencies. The statutory authorities for most agencies, however, include some limitations on the use of the agreements, although the extent and type of limitations vary. We found that most of the 11 agencies used OTAs for two purposes: (1) research, development, and demonstration; and (2) prototype development. Three agencies—the Federal Aviation Administration, TSA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration—used OTAs for different activities, such as airport security and education and outreach. Only a few agencies, including TSA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have unrestricted authority to award OTAs. We also found that 9 of the 11 agencies had fewer than 90 active OTAs per fiscal year, but that, in contrast, TSA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had hundreds, and thousands, respectively. TSA’s Office of Contracting and Procurement established policy and procedures for the use, award, and oversight of OTAs in 2011. Prior to 2011, TSA had no governing policy for OTAs. According to TSA’s policy, which has been revised several times since its inception, OTAs are best suited for situations where: an entity is not a traditional contracting partner, for example, airlines, airport authorities, trade associations, quasi-governmental entities, or research and development organizations; there are cost sharing mechanisms that require the recipient to contribute to the overall cost of the effort; or the recipient must recoup all costs through third-party user-fees. Further, the policy states that OTAs may not be used when the principal purpose of the agreement is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the United States government. Table 2 identifies some of the key provisions of TSA’s OTA policy. This framework for awarding and overseeing OTAs is similar to those for contracts. Further, according to TSA’s OTA policy, contracting officers who award OTAs must be certified at Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Level III and demonstrate possession of a level of experience, responsibility, business acumen, and judgment that enables them to operate in the relatively unstructured business environment of the OTA. From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, TSA reported obligating millions annually through OTAs, which amounted to at least $1.4 billion, or about 13 percent of its overall obligations during this time. Five TSA reimbursement programs used OTAs to partially or fully reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the allowable costs associated with TSA security programs such as the design and construction of checked baggage inline systems. These five reimbursement programs accounted for about 99 percent of the $1.1 billion that TSA obligated on OTAs that were awarded during this period. The remaining three non- reimbursement programs accounted for a small amount of obligations and awarded a low number of OTAs for services including intelligence analysis and the development of aviation standards. From fiscal year 2012 to 2016, TSA reported obligating millions annually through OTAs, amounting to at least $1.4 billion, or about 13 percent of its overall obligations through contracts and OTAs. Annual OTA obligations remained fairly stable over this period, except for fiscal year 2013 when obligations spiked and then sharply declined in fiscal year 2014. This spike was driven in large part by the Electronic Baggage Screening Program, which obligated $519 million on 54 OTAs in fiscal year 2013 but obligated only $4 million on one OTA in fiscal year 2014. See table 3 for TSA’s obligations on contracts and OTAs. From fiscal year 2012 to 2016 eight TSA programs used OTAs to meet a variety of mission requirements. Five reimbursement programs used OTAs to partially or fully reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the allowable costs associated with TSA security programs. This accounted for about 99 percent of all OTA awards and obligations from fiscal year 2012 to 2016. The remaining three non-reimbursement programs accounted for a small amount of obligations and awarded a low number of OTAs for services including intelligence analysis and the development of aviation standards. See table 4 for the number of OTA awards and obligations by program. For more information on the programs and OTAs we reviewed, see appendix I. The five reimbursement programs awarded numerous OTAs to different airports and law enforcement agencies for similar requirements. These programs each used a class determination and findings that describes the general requirement and other parameters such as a range of possible award amounts or periods of performance. TSA has an OTA template with standard provisions. Terms tailored to the specific airport or law enforcement agency are then provided in the individual OTAs. The following examples illustrate some of the ways TSA has used OTAs to reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the costs associated with TSA security programs. The Electronic Baggage Screening Program is an acquisition program that tests, procures, deploys, and maintains checked baggage screening equipment at federalized airports. TSA uses FAR-based contracts to buy things like explosives detection machines and engineering support services. TSA uses OTAs to reimburse airports for the allowable design and construction costs associated with facility modifications needed for installing, updating, or replacing in-line checked baggage screening systems. These systems use conveyor belts to route checked luggage through an explosives detection machine which captures an image of the checked bag to determine if the bag contains any type of threat item including explosives. Agreements generally range in value from $50,000 to $150 million, and the anticipated period of performance can range from 6 months to 3 years, depending on the size and complexity of the project. In one example, TSA entered into an OTA to reimburse the City of Cleveland about $24 million for work at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport for installation of explosive detection systems within the checked baggage screening area. The Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program provides partial salary reimbursement to approximately 325 airports to offset the costs of carrying out aviation law enforcement responsibilities in support of passenger screening activities. Reimbursement is based on an established “not-to-exceed” hourly rate or the actual cost per hour, whichever is lower. Agreements range in value depending on the airport category, the number of checkpoints and law enforcement officers, hours of operation, and availability of funds. The period of performance for these agreements is generally 3 to 5 years. For example, TSA entered into an agreement with the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Board that lasted from October 2012 to March 2016 to reimburse the airport about $5.5 million. While the five reimbursement programs awarded numerous OTAs for the same purpose to different airports and law enforcement agencies, the remaining three non-reimbursement programs awarded few OTAs and their use was more varied. Specifically, the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, the Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service, and the Office of Global Strategies used OTAs for a range of services including intelligence analysis and the development of aviation standards. For example: The Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement is responsible for developing security policies to reduce the risk of catastrophic terrorist attacks. From fiscal year 2012 to 2016, the office awarded four OTAs. These included two awards to the American Public Transportation Association to meet ongoing requirements for intelligence gathering, public transit information sharing and analysis, and the development of mass transit and passenger rail security practices. The Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service awarded 13 OTAs to pay for parking for federal air marshals and authorized Law Enforcement Office employees at airports including John F. Kennedy International and Washington Dulles International. However, in September 2016, TSA competitively awarded a contract to manage parking expenses at numerous airports. According to officials, parking requirements for the Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service will be met through the contract and as a result, existing OTAs for this requirement are being phased out. Other than the parking OTAs, TSA officials noted that the requirements for the seven remaining programs that used OTAs from fiscal year 2012 to 2016 are ongoing and that TSA will continue to use OTAs for the same purposes in fiscal year 2017 and beyond, contingent on available funding. They also noted that they do not anticipate any new uses of OTAs. Our review of 29 OTAs awarded by 8 TSA programs from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 found that the methods used to determine price reasonableness and monitor these OTAs varied based on the complexity of the requirement. Further, for the key areas we reviewed, the OTAs generally met the requirements of TSA’s policy. Nonetheless, TSA’s own 2015 internal compliance review found significant gaps in OTA documentation and reporting. In response to these deficiencies, TSA has taken action to strengthen oversight and compliance with its policy. TSA’s OTA policy requires contracting officers to determine that the price negotiated under the OTA is reasonable and to appoint a COR to provide monitoring and a range of administration tasks to ensure that requirements are satisfactorily delivered. For the 29 OTAs we reviewed, we found that the methods used to determine price reasonableness and provide monitoring varied based on the complexity of the requirement. Approaches to determining price reasonableness ranged from instances where TSA extensively evaluated proposed costs to more straightforward analysis. For OTAs awarded by the Electronic Baggage Screening Program where the requirements for infrastructure design and construction can be complex, the program produces an independent government cost estimate based on design drawings and specifications from the airports which are required to follow TSA’s detailed guidance. The program compares the estimate with the airport authority’s independent bid for the design and construction. Any discrepancies are noted in the technical evaluation, which the contracting officer reviews and documents in the business clearance memorandum. For example, in fiscal year 2016, TSA awarded an OTA for $23 million to the City of Chicago for the recapitalization of the checked baggage resolution area at O’Hare International Airport. Certain proposed costs in the contractor’s bid were higher than TSA’s independent government cost estimate. The contracting officer performed an evaluation of the costs and determined that they were reasonable and that the difference was, in part, the result of the airport having greater familiarity with the existing conditions at the site than TSA’s cost estimators. By contrast, some programs took a more straightforward approach to determining price reasonableness, including cases where the costs were predetermined or not negotiable. For example, the Checkpoint Janitorial and Utilities Program used OTAs as a vehicle for reimbursing airport authorities for the costs of electricity to operate TSA screening equipment and for janitorial services in checkpoint areas. TSA had independently verified electricity prices set by the local power authority. Prices for janitorial services were verified based on the airport’s competitively- awarded janitorial contracts. In one case, TSA entered into an OTA to reimburse the Massachusetts Port Authority for $678,000 for one year. TSA performed price analysis on historical data from agreements dating back to 2008 and reviewed changes to the checkpoint square footage and changes in electrical consumption based on use of new TSA equipment. The airport authority provided documentation verifying electrical rates set by the local power authority that TSA’s contracting officer used to determine fair and reasonable pricing. Janitorial costs were based on TSA’s pro-rated share of the airport’s competitively-awarded janitorial contract and considered to be fair and reasonable based on adequate competition in the commercial market-place. TSA verified the rates each year prior to executing options. COR monitoring similarly varied depending on the complexity of the requirement. For the more complex design and construction projects under the Electronic Baggage Screening Program, COR monitoring was more rigorous than for programs with less complex requirements. According to 2016 guidance, the COR is the primary interface between TSA and the airport and is responsible for performing stakeholder coordination functions. During the design phase, the COR is to review the airport’s design documentation to ensure compliance with TSA’s guidelines and standards in collaboration with TSA subject matter experts. During the construction phase, the COR is responsible for performing ongoing oversight including reviewing invoices prior to payment. For an OTA awarded to the Miami Dade Aviation Department the COR reviews monthly milestone progress status reports as well as weekly status reports prepared by TSA’s site integration contractor highlighting work completed, ongoing activities, and program risks. A contracting official noted that schedule slippage is a big risk for cost reimbursement projects which is mitigated by COR oversight, as well as the ongoing oversight of the site leads. A contracting official also noted that most CORs for these OTAs have DHS certification for program and project management providing them with greater technical and administrative expertise to monitor more complex projects. In one instance on another project with complex requirements under the Advanced Surveillance Program, project monitoring resulted in TSA and the airport working together to contain costs when a project did not go as expected. In fiscal year 2012, TSA awarded an OTA for $7.2 million to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for the design, installation and maintenance of a security system, including closed-circuit television cameras and associated software, at John F. Kennedy International Airport. In fiscal year 2013, TSA modified the OTA to add more cameras, thereby increasing the cost of the project to $21 million. However, during installation, the Port Authority experienced several unforeseen issues with the project, including reduced work hours available for unionized labor and asbestos abatement costs. As a result, the Port Authority reassessed its original cost estimate and determined that it was not sustainable. In fiscal year 2017, TSA and the Port Authority agreed to decrease the scope of the project from 751 cameras to 389 cameras to stay within the original $21 million estimate. Starting in fiscal year 2015, four years after it issued its 2011 OTA policy, TSA began to include OTAs in its contract compliance review program. Compliance reviews are conducted quarterly based on a selection of contracts and OTAs awarded in the previous quarter and intended to improve contracting operations, ensure compliance with applicable standards and policies, and identify best practices. Based on the number of findings identified in its review of six OTA actions included in a 2015 quarterly review, TSA commissioned an OTA-specific compliance review in June 2015. The OTA-specific review covered 30 actions with a total value of about $82 million and identified significant gaps in documentation and reporting. For example, 18 of 27 OTAs awarded after TSA’s 2011 policy was issued did not include a determination and findings approving the action. As noted above, this is a key document that describes the rationale for using an OTA instead of a traditional contract and the determination of price reasonableness. The review also found that 18 of 30 files did not document the assignment of a COR to perform oversight and that 20 of 30 FPDS-NG records were incorrect. In response to the findings of the OTA-specific compliance review, TSA implemented a number of actions and has subsequently found improvement in OTAs meeting documentation and reporting requirements. We found that TSA revised the OTA policy to clarify requirements and increased training for contracting officers with OTA warrants. Specifically, to obtain the OTA warrant, contracting officers must complete webinar training and 3 days of classroom training. To maintain the warrant, contracting officers must retake the webinar training every two years. According to TSA contracting officials, all of the 56 contracting officers had completed the new training requirements as of May 2017. In addition, TSA has continued to include OTAs in its quarterly compliance review process. Based on our analysis of TSA’s fiscal year 2016 compliance reviews, we found that TSA reviewed 16 OTAs with a total value of $62 million. In those reviews, 12 of the 16 findings were determined to be low risk. For example, several of the files did not include documentation of COR certification. The remaining four OTAs had findings that were determined to be medium risk. This includes, for example, one case where the OTA period of performance started 5 months before the OTA was signed. None of the OTAs, however, was missing a determination and findings and three had missing or incorrect FPDS-NG entries. Officials noted that their efforts to increase training, oversight, and enforcement of OTA policies and procedures have resulted in increased awareness of reporting requirements and greater compliance. In addition, TSA also recently increased oversight of the COR program to support efficient OTA and contract oversight and administration. A TSA official responsible for the COR program reported that in fiscal year 2017, TSA began to conduct quarterly compliance reviews of the COR program to ensure greater consistency in oversight practices across the agency. According to COR compliance review guidance issued in 2016, the reviews are intended to highlight positive practices, effective management techniques, and identify areas of improvements. Our analysis of data in FPDS-NG showed that issues with incomplete data have been corrected over time, in part due to increased oversight. We compared data reported in TSA’s financial management and accounting systems with data reported in FPDS-NG and found that the percentage of new OTAs reported in FPDS-NG increased from 37 percent in 2012 to 95 percent in 2016. TSA’s policy requires that OTAs be reported in the OTA module within FPDS-NG. The awarding contracting officer has responsibility for accurately entering OTA information, including the value of the award and the period of performance. TSA contracting officials attributed gaps in data in part to the fact that the process for entering OTA data into FPDS-NG is manual, whereas FPDS- NG automatically pulls data for contracts from TSA’s contract writing system. According to officials, OTAs are excluded from the contract writing system due to system limitations and this additional step increases the chance that a contracting officer may forget to enter the data into FPDS-NG or enter it into the system incorrectly. TSA officials noted that they have taken steps to improve the accuracy of the data reported in FPDS-NG by reviewing and verifying entries on a monthly basis in accordance with TSA’s policy. Our review of 29 OTAs also demonstrated that the OTAs generally met the requirements for the key areas of TSA policy that we reviewed. For example, TSA’s policy states that if the OTA will be awarded without competition, the determination and findings must include a discussion of the method for selecting the OTA recipient. None of the OTAs we reviewed was competed because TSA determined that competition was not applicable due to the nature of the requirements. Nonetheless, all the determination and findings included a discussion of the method for selecting OTA recipients, a process that varied by program. For example, the Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program posts a solicitation and selects eligible applicants based on review criteria. By contrast, the Advanced Surveillance Program prioritizes projects using a risk-based matrix that assesses threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences populated with data from 449 airports. Despite improvements, TSA officials acknowledged the need for continued vigilance based on several issues we identified. For example, TSA entered into a “no funding” OTA in 2013 with Signature Flight Support, a commercial fixed-base operator at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. A fixed-base operator is an organization granted the right by an airport to provide aeronautical services such as fueling, hangaring, tie-down and parking, aircraft rental, aircraft maintenance, flight instruction, and similar services. Under the agreement, Signature Flight Support collects and remits special security screening and threat assessment fees from airline operators on behalf of TSA, fees that are required due to the airport’s location within a flight restricted zone and special flight rules area. TSA does not obligate funds through the OTA, which primarily establishes the responsibilities and procedures for the fee collection and remittal. Our review found that TSA did not take any action to extend or renew the agreement after it expired in December 2014. However, TSA program officials told us that Signature Flight Support continued to provide the service although an agreement was not in place. When we brought this issue to TSA’s attention, officials agreed the OTA period of performance should have been extended each year. Officials told us that as of October 2017 they anticipate awarding a new OTA for this requirement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, more than three years after the OTA expired. In addition to the steps TSA has taken to improve OTA oversight, such as revising its OTA policy and increasing training requirements, TSA officials told us that they will continue to conduct quarterly compliance reviews and monthly data verification in accordance with their policy.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. Purpose: Reimburses airports for the allowable costs related to various airport checked baggage screening projects including the design and construction of checked baggage inline systems and the recapitalization of existing inline systems. Agreements generally range in value from $50,000 to $150 million, and the anticipated period of performance can range from 6 months to 3 years, depending on the size of airport and complexity of the project. TSA rationale for using Other Transaction Agreement (OTA): Airports are owned and operated either by city or county municipalities, airport boards or trusts, or, in some cases as not-for-profit entities. Given that the program requires modifications to airport terminals that are owned by an entity other than the federal government, it is more practical for the airport to oversee and monitor the construction or modifications required for their facilities. Method of selecting OTA recipient: Airports submit applications through the airport’s Federal Security Director—a TSA employee responsible for security operations at federalized airports—including a description of the requirement, schematic design, budgetary cost estimate, and data relating to number of bags processed and airlines served. TSA prioritizes applications using a risk-based model and by considering several factors such as the cost share the airport is willing to assume and the readiness of the airport to begin the project. OTA type: Partial cost share/reimbursement. Depending on the airport’s size, TSA will reimburse 90 or 95 percent of the allowable, allocable and reasonable cost of certain projects. In other types of projects, TSA provides 100 percent reimbursement—for example, for existing systems requiring the correction of security or safety deficiencies. Method of determining price reasonableness: TSA produces an independent government cost estimate based on design drawings and specifications received from the airport and approved by TSA. The estimate is developed using industry standards and is used for evaluating total project cost. When bids are received from the airport, TSA compares the bid amount with the estimate. TSA may conduct further analysis and discussion to ensure that the estimate correctly reflects the scope included in the bid documents. Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) monitoring: The COR is the primary interface between TSA and the airport and is responsible for performing stakeholder coordination functions. During the design phase, the COR is to review the airport’s design documentation to ensure compliance with TSAs guidelines and standards in collaboration with TSA subject matter experts. During the construction phase, the COR is to monitor project schedule and scope through processes such as weekly and monthly reporting. Purpose: Provides partial reimbursement to approximately 325 airports to offset the allowable costs of carrying out aviation law enforcement responsibilities in support of passenger screening activities. TSA rationale for using OTA: Participants are not traditional contracting partners; most participants must contribute to the cost of providing law enforcement officer support at the checkpoints; and the agreements do not acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the government. Method of selecting OTA recipient: The program posts a solicitation to FedBizOpps.gov with eligibility requirements, application process, review criteria, and selection process. Airports as well as state, local, or other public institutions/organizations responsible for commercial airport operations that have incurred law enforcement service costs due to TSA security mandates are eligible. The Federal Security Director—a TSA employee responsible for security operations at federalized airports— along with the Law Enforcement Officer Program Office, Office of Chief Counsel, and the contracting officer, participate in selecting eligible applicants. OTA type: Partial cost reimbursement. Method of determining price reasonableness: OTAs are negotiated to provide reimbursement for law enforcement officer support at an established “not-to-exceed” hourly rate or the actual cost per hour, whichever is lower. The amount of partial reimbursement is based on airport category, the number of checkpoints, hours of operation, and availability of funds. COR monitoring: CORs provide technical direction and day-to-day oversight of the program, work with the airport Federal Security Director to make sure that requirements are being satisfied, and approve invoices prior to payment. Purpose: Provides reimbursement for the allowable costs incurred to design, install, or expand surveillance systems to meet the required views of the local TSA. Project costs generally range from $200,000 to $21 million with an anticipated period of performance ranging from 6 months to 3 years depending on the complexity of the system and facility size. TSA rationale for using OTA: The primary beneficiary of the surveillance equipment is the facility that will take ownership of the system and be solely responsible for its operation. The use of an OTA provides for the facility to manage and perform the work but allows TSA oversight and control over the expenditure of TSA funds. TSA will not benefit directly from the purchase, installation, and operation of the system, so a traditional contract would not be appropriate. Method of selecting OTA recipient: The program prioritizes projects based on a risk-based matrix that assesses threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences based on data from 449 airports. Airports must be willing to complete the project within the required timeframe. OTA type: Cost reimbursement. Method of determining price reasonableness: The program uses a pre-award systems engineering process which culminates in a project evaluation and plan, a comprehensive surveillance assessment of TSA managed areas, and an independent government cost estimate. TSA reviews the cost elements to, for example, validate labor categories, labor hours, materials, and other direct costs based on industry standards and comparison with other projects. The program also uses market research and historical data to inform price analysis. COR monitoring: The COR works with project coordinators to monitor OTA performance and maintains direct contact with the transportation facility and the local TSA representatives. The COR reviews invoices to ensure that the transportation facility (via its contractor) has met all acceptance criteria prior to approval and payment of each invoice. Upon completion of installation and testing, TSA obtains an acceptance report to be signed by the transportation facility authority and major stakeholders including facility representatives, and the responsible TSA Federal Security Director, contracting officer, and COR. Purpose: Provides partial reimbursement to airports, mass transit systems, and state and local law enforcement participants for the allowable costs incurred associated with the operation of the authorized canine teams and explosives storage magazines. Allowable costs that will be reimbursed include handlers' salaries and care for the canines. In turn, the local jurisdiction agrees to a set of responsibilities including using TSA trained canine teams at least 80 percent of their on-duty time in the transportation environment and to maintain a minimum of three certified teams available for around-the-clock incident response. The program reimburses participants up to $50,500 per canine team for allowable costs incurred. The period of performance for these OTAs is up to 5 years. TSA rationale for using OTA: A standard procurement contract is not suitable because the airports, mass transit, and maritime facilities are not owned by TSA, but by airport authorities, and state and local agencies. These entities have the responsibility for the control and oversight of security operations at a specific location, either by having their own law enforcement officers, or using the state or local law enforcement officers. Since TSA does not own the airport or have primary law enforcement responsibility and only provides participants partial reimbursement for the operating costs of the teams, an OTA is warranted. Method of selecting OTA recipient: Transportation authorities and/or local law enforcement entities submit a written request outlining their desire to join the program in which they outline the need for the canine teams within their respective transportation system/s. TSA selects recipients based on a review of the transportation system’s risk profile and the program’s available team openings. OTA type: Partial cost reimbursement. Method of determining price reasonableness: The $50,500 per team stipend only covers a portion of the cost to the participant. There are instances after award that require an additional price reasonableness determination, such as when a participant requests reimbursement for a supply or service that is either unknown to the program or inconsistent with program historical prices for the given supply/service. If the program determines that the item is allocable the program will determine whether it was procured competitively and any facts that may support it being higher than historical prices paid. If the item was not procured competitively, the program will look at current price lists and catalogs for a same or similar item and consult program subject matter experts on their personal knowledge of the item(s) being purchased. COR monitoring: The program assigns a Field Canine Coordinator who is responsible for overseeing the participant’s compliance with the agreement through periodic reporting and assessments. Reimbursement is to be made upon receipt and review of summited expenses by the COR and contracting officer. Purpose: The Checkpoint Janitorial and Utilities program uses OTAs to define the terms and conditions for TSA’s use of checkpoint space in mandated non-leased space at airports and to provide a vehicle for reimbursing the cost of electrical consumption and janitorial services. TSA rationale for using OTA: A procurement contract is not suitable since the airport is a governmental entity, not a commercial vendor. Additionally, airports often contract directly with a utility provider or janitorial company. Method of selecting OTA recipient: Airports request reimbursement for utility costs and janitorial services in mandated non-leased space at TSA security checkpoints. TSA Federal Security Directors who are responsible for security operations at federalized airports confirm the need for reimbursing the cost of utilities and janitorial services at the checkpoint space. These OTAs are not available for competition as the only available source is the airport authority. OTA type: Cost reimbursement. Method of determining price reasonableness: TSA reimburses airports at cost for the costs of electrical consumption by TSA screening equipment located in the checkpoint space based on a cost allocation methodology. TSA reimburses airports for its pro-rata share of the airports janitorial costs per square foot also based on a cost allocation methodology. In the files we reviewed, prices were considered to be fair and reasonable based on documentation verifying the rates set by the local power authority. Costs were considered to be fair and reasonable based on the airports’ competitively-awarded janitorial contracts and rates established by the local utility authority. COR monitoring: Provides technical direction, contractor oversight, and certification of payments. Purpose: The office has an ongoing requirement for intelligence gathering, public transit information sharing and analysis, and development of mass transit and passenger rail recommended security practices. TSA rationale for using OTA: The American Public Transportation Association is a not-for-profit trade association which therefore may not currently have the experience, knowledge, or past performance to support a FAR type contract. Method of selecting OTA recipient: Through market research, TSA determined that the American Public Transportation Association was uniquely capable of meeting requirements. OTA type: Fixed price. Method of determining price reasonableness: In 2014, price was determined to be fair and reasonable based primarily on historical data and prices consistent with the preceding interagency agreement and the office’s independent government cost estimate. In 2016, the program updated the independent government cost estimate based on a quote from the American Public Transportation Association which provided for greater clarity, insight, and definition to the actual costs. Additional market research is planned to determine the best way to fulfill this requirement in the future. COR monitoring: The COR developed a contract management plan which identifies a detailed list of work products and delivery schedule. The expected deliverables are also detailed in the OTA statement of work. Responsibilities of the contractor include developing and managing a project plan; updating the plan as the project evolves; reporting project progress and status via monthly reports; and, participating in TSA- scheduled conference calls, if necessary, to review project progress, identify and discuss issues, and discuss corrective action. Purpose: The Surface Division of the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement has a need to maintain railroad police personnel involvement and a liaison relationship with the FBI’s National Joint Terrorism Task Force. The requirement entails the direct employment of intelligence gathering focused on preventing terrorist acts affecting the nation’s passenger and freight-rail infrastructure to facilitate the continuity of communications, liaison, intelligence analysis and information sharing among federal, state, local and railroad industry police/security agencies. TSA rationale for using OTA: A procurement contract is not suitable for this requirement, as the purpose of the action is to not acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the United States government. Rather, the requirement entails the direct employment of intelligence gathering focused on preventing terrorist acts affecting the nation’s passenger and freight-rail infrastructure. Method of selecting OTA recipient: Since 2003, the Association of American Railroads has provided the TSA with a railroad police officer charged with collecting and analyzing intelligence information. Market research reveals the Association of American Railroads to be one of two major railway representation groups in the U.S. counting among its membership the seven largest freight and passenger rail carriers in North America. A follow-on agreement with the Association of American Railroads maintains an uninterrupted flow of the critical intelligence necessary in monitoring the safety and security of the nation’s railway infrastructure. OTA type: Fixed price. Method of determining price reasonableness: The program developed an independent government cost estimate based on prices paid under a previous agreement which allows for an inflationary cost adjustment of 3 percent per year and determined the annual funding cost to be fair and reasonable in meeting this requirement. COR monitoring: The COR is responsible for the technical administration and liaison of the agreement and is to review and certify invoices for completeness and accuracy before approving them for payment. As authorized by the FBI, the assigned railroad police officer is to provide a monthly written report that summarizes the activities and accomplishments related to the tasks outlined in the agreement. Purpose: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is located within the Flight Restricted Zone and Special Flight Rules Area. As such, the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement developed a security program for approved general aviation aircraft operators which requires stringent security measures including requirements for background checks, physical screening of passengers and baggage. Aircraft operators are responsible for reimbursing TSA for the cost of the security screening. TSA requires the use of the airport facility to perform the screening function and a mechanism for the collection of security screening and threat assessment fees from aircraft operators and remittance of those fees to TSA. TSA rationale for using OTA: A procurement contract is not suitable for this requirement because TSA is not acquiring, purchasing, or leasing any product or service. The OTA primarily establishes the responsibilities of the parties and the fee collection and remittal procedures. Method of selecting OTA recipient: TSA determined that Signature Flight Support, as the sole commercial fixed base operator granted the right to operate at Reagan National Airport to provide aeronautical services such as fueling, hangaring, parking, aircraft rental, aircraft maintenance, flight instruction, and similar services—is therefore the only entity capable of providing the facilities and services required to implement this program. OTA type: No funding. Method of determining price reasonableness: Not applicable. COR monitoring: The COR is responsible for providing technical direction and administration. Purpose: The Office of Global Strategies is directed to encourage the development of civil aviation security, and is authorized to furnish to international organizations certain technical expertise and assistance. The office awarded an OTA to the International Civil Aviation Organization—a specialized agency of the United Nations committed to preventing and deterring unlawful interference with international civil aviation—to cover the salaries and benefits for three TSA employees assigned to the organization as senior security advisors. TSA actively participates in the organization’s Aviation Security Panel of Experts, which is responsible for promulgating international security standards. TSA rationale for using OTA: An OTA is best suited for this requirement since the International Civil Aviation Organization is a United Nations specialized agency and TSA is not acquiring any property or services for the direct benefit or use of the United States government. Method of selecting OTA recipient: There are no known alternative sources. OTA type: Fixed price. Method of determining a fair and reasonable price: Both the Program Office and the Contracting Officer solely relied upon historical salaries as previously used with the International Civil Aviation Organization. COR monitoring: The COR reviews and the contracting officer approves all invoices prior to payment. Purpose: TSA has a requirement to obtain parking spaces/permits for Federal Air Marshals during their mission flights for various airports. TSA rationale for using OTA: A procurement contract is not suitable for this requirement as airport parking is not considered a commercial item/service to the public; it is only available to business partners. An OTA allows TSA to participate in an airport’s business partner category. Further OTAs provide a practical vehicle because the airport authority is considered a U.S. state government entity. Method of selecting OTA recipient: TSA conducted market research which found that an OTA with the airport provides a significant cost savings to the government compared with other alternatives. TSA compared the costs of parking as a business partner with the cost of parking at the typical rates at the airport. OTA type: Fixed price. Method of determining a fair and reasonable price: TSA prepared an independent government cost estimate based upon commercial market pricing for airport parking. COR monitoring: TSA will pay the airport the variable fixed rate on a monthly basis. All costs will be invoiced based on actual costs incurred, but not to exceed the OTA amount. To receive payment from TSA, the airport submits one-page invoice to include the quantity used, unit price, and extended prices of the monthly deliverable. The invoice will be reviewed and approved by the COR and contracting officer prior to payment. Purpose: TSA has a need for parking for authorized Office of Law Enforcement Employees at Washington Dulles International Airport. TSA rationale for using OTA: Need for parking can be met more economically with mechanism to directly reimburse Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Method of selecting OTA recipient: TSA conducted market research which found that an OTA with the Metropolitan Washington Area Airport authority provides a significant cost savings to the government compared with other alternatives. OTA type: Fixed price. Method of determining a fair and reasonable price: TSA conducted price analysis and found that other available lots are all more expensive, farther away from the airport, and lack the capacity to service 400 people. COR monitoring: Perform surveillance to assure performance and compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. Certify invoices to the contracting officer for payment. In addition to the contact named above, Tatiana Winger (Assistant Director), Angie Nichols-Friedman (Analyst in Charge), Peter Anderson, Lorraine Ettaro, Julia Kennon, Carol Petersen, Lindsay Taylor, Westley Tsou, Alyssa Weir, and Robin Wilson made key contributions to this report.", "answers": ["TSA is responsible for securing the nation's transportation systems and uses security technologies to screen airline passengers and their luggage to prevent prohibited items from being carried on commercial aircraft. TSA has special authority for using OTAs, which are not subject to certain federal contract laws and requirements. OTAs provide flexibility to help meet mission needs, but potentially carry the risk of reduced accountability and transparency. GAO was asked to examine TSA's use of OTAs. This report addresses: (1) the extent and purposes of TSA's use of OTAs, and (2) how TSA ensures prices are reasonable and how it oversees OTAs. To address TSA's use of OTAs, GAO analyzed data on OTA awards and obligations from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation from fiscal years 2012 to 2016 (the most recent years for which data were available). GAO determined that data were sufficiently reliable to report on TSA's minimum use of OTAs. To examine how TSA prices and oversees OTAs, GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 29 OTAs from the 8 TSA programs that awarded them based on program size and OTA value. GAO reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed contracting and program officials. During fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) awarded at least 1,039 other transaction agreements (OTA) and obligated at least $1.4 billion on them. These agreements, which are neither traditional contracts nor grants, were primarily used to reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the costs associated with TSA security programs. For example, TSA awarded at least 109 OTAs and obligated at least $783 million from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to reimburse airports for the allowable design and construction costs associated with installing, updating, or replacing checked baggage screening systems. TSA also used OTAs for intelligence analysis and to offset the costs of providing canines for explosives detection, among other things. TSA Used Other Transaction Agreements to Reimburse Airports for Design and Construction Costs Associated with Checked Baggage Screening Systems For the selected 29 OTAs GAO reviewed, GAO found that the methods TSA used to determine price reasonableness varied depending on the complexity of the requirement. For example, For complex design and construction projects, TSA compared independent government cost estimates with contractor bids. Certified program managers monitored project schedule and scope through site visits and status reports. In contrast, TSA independently verified the rates set by the local power authority when reimbursing some airports for electricity costs to operate TSA screening equipment. GAO also found that TSA has taken action to address prior lapses in oversight, resulting in improved compliance. In 2015, TSA identified significant gaps in OTA file documentation and data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation. TSA took action to address these deficiencies by (1) updating its policy, (2) requiring additional training for contracting officers, (3) instituting monthly data verification, and (4) monitoring compliance through quarterly reviews. GAO's analysis confirmed that the quality of the data had improved between fiscal year 2012 and 2016. Moreover, the 29 OTAs generally met key requirements of TSA's policy that GAO identified. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report."], "length": 7426, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "357977aac62ac12b4958584d44cddcdeeb3c3b2835ed1358"}
{"input": "", "context": "In November 2002, Congress passed and the President signed the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), which was later amended by IPERA and the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA). The amended legislation requires executive branch agencies to (1) review all programs and activities and identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments (commonly referred to as a risk assessment), (2) publish improper payment estimates for those programs and activities that the agency identified as being susceptible to significant improper payments, (3) implement corrective actions to reduce improper payments and set reduction targets, and (4) report on the results of addressing the foregoing requirements. In addition to the agencies’ identifying programs and activities that are susceptible to significant improper payments, OMB designates as high priority the programs with the most egregious cases of improper payments. Specifically, under a provision added to IPIA by IPERIA, OMB is required to annually identify a list of high-priority federal programs in need of greater oversight and review. In general, for fiscal years 2014 through 2017, OMB implemented this requirement by designating high- priority programs based on a threshold of $750 million in estimated improper payments for a given fiscal year. OMB also plays a key role in implementing laws related to improper payment reporting. Specifically, OMB is directed by statute to provide guidance to federal agencies on estimating, reporting, reducing, and recovering improper payments. IPERA also requires executive agencies’ IGs to annually determine and report on whether their respective agencies complied with certain IPERA- related criteria. If an agency does not meet one or more of the six IPERA criteria for any of its programs or activities, the agency is considered noncompliant overall. The six criteria are as follows: 1. publish a report in the form and content required by OMB—typically an agency financial report (AFR) or a performance and accountability report (PAR)—for the most recent fiscal year, and post that report on the agency website; 2. conduct a program-specific risk assessment, if required, for each program or activity that conforms with IPIA as amended; 3. publish improper payment estimates for all programs and activities deemed susceptible to significant improper payments under the agency’s risk assessments; 4. publish corrective action plans for those programs and activities assessed to be at risk for significant improper payments; 5. publish and meet annual reduction targets for all programs and activities assessed to be at risk for significant improper payments; and 6. report a gross improper payment rate of less than 10 percent for each program and activity for which an improper payment estimate was published. Under IPERA, agencies reported by their IG as not in compliance with any of these criteria in a fiscal year are required to submit a plan to Congress describing the actions they will take to come into compliance, and such plans shall include measureable milestones, the designation of senior accountable officials, and the establishment of accountability mechanisms to achieve compliance. OMB guidance states that agencies are required to submit these plans to Congress and OMB in the first year of reported noncompliance. When agency programs are reported as noncompliant for consecutive years, IPERA and OMB guidance requires agencies and OMB to take additional actions. Specifically, an agency with a program reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years is required to submit to Congress within 30 days of the IG’s report either (1) a reauthorization proposal for the program or (2) the proposed statutory changes necessary to bring the program or activity into compliance. We previously recommended that when agencies determine that reauthorization or statutory changes are not necessary to bring the programs into compliance, the agencies should state so in their notifications to Congress. Effective starting with fiscal year 2018 reporting, OMB updated its guidance to instruct agencies with programs reported as noncompliant for 3 consecutive years to explain what the agency is doing to achieve compliance if a reauthorization proposal or proposed statutory change will not bring a program into compliance with IPERA. The updated guidance also instructs agencies with programs reported as noncompliant for 4 or more consecutive years to submit a report to Congress and OMB (within 30 days of the IG’s determination of noncompliance) detailing the activities taken and still being pursued to prevent and reduce improper payments. If agency programs are reported as noncompliant under IPERA for 2 consecutive years, and the Director of OMB determines that additional funding would help the agency come into compliance, the head of the agency must obligate additional funding in the amount determined by the Director to intensify compliance efforts. IPERA directs the agency to exercise any reprogramming or transfer authority that the agency may have to provide additional funding to meet the level determined by OMB and, if necessary, submit a request to Congress for additional reprogramming or transfer authority to meet the full level of funding determined by OMB. Table 1 summarizes agency and OMB requirements related to agency programs that are noncompliant under IPERA, as reported by their IGs. Seven years after the initial implementation of IPERA, over half of the 24 CFO Act agencies were reported as noncompliant by their IGs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Specifically, 13 agencies were reported as noncompliant with one or more IPERA criteria for fiscal year 2016, and 14 agencies were reported as noncompliant for fiscal year 2017 (see fig. 1). Nine of these agencies have been reported as noncompliant in one or more programs every year since IPERA was implemented in 2011 (see app. II for additional details on CFO Act agencies’ compliance under IPERA for fiscal years 2011 through 2017, as reported by their IGs). Although the number of agencies reported as noncompliant under IPERA has varied slightly since fiscal year 2011, the total instances of noncompliance for all six criteria substantially improved after fiscal year 2011, when IPERA was first implemented. As shown in figure 2, the total instances decreased from 38 instances (for 14 noncompliant agencies) for fiscal year 2011 to 26 instances (for 14 noncompliant agencies) for fiscal year 2017. Also, for fiscal year 2017, 7 of 14 agencies were reported as noncompliant for only one criterion per noncompliant program. Of these, 6 agencies—the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Education (Education), Commerce, and Transportation; the General Services Administration; and the Social Security Administration (SSA)—were only reported as noncompliant with the IPERA criterion that requires agencies to publish and meet reduction targets. In addition, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) was only reported as noncompliant with the IPERA criterion that requires agencies to report improper payment rates below 10 percent. Furthermore, the programs reported as noncompliant for fiscal year 2017 accounted for a significantly smaller portion of the total reported estimated improper payments as compared to the noncompliant programs for fiscal year 2015. Specifically, we previously reported that 52 noncompliant programs accounted for $132 billion (or about 96 percent) of the $137 billion total reported estimated improper payments for fiscal year 2015, whereas 58 noncompliant programs accounted for $80 billion (or about 57 percent) of the $141 billion total reported estimated improper payments for fiscal year 2017. Although improper payment estimates associated with noncompliant programs vary from year to year, this decrease (approximately $52 billion) was primarily due to two programs. Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Medicare Fee-for-Service (Parts A and B) and Medicare Part C programs were reported as noncompliant and accounted for approximately $43 billion and $14 billion, respectively, of estimated improper payments for fiscal year 2015. These programs were reported as compliant for fiscal year 2017 and accounted for approximately $36 billion and $14 billion, respectively, or about 36 percent of the $141 billion total reported improper payments for fiscal year 2017. Almost a third (18 programs) of the 58 programs that contributed to 14 CFO Act agencies’ noncompliance under IPERA, as of fiscal year 2017, were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. The number of programs noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years has continually increased since fiscal year 2015, as shown in figure 3. Specifically, 12 programs (associated with 7 agencies) were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2015, and the number increased to 14 programs (associated with 8 agencies) and 18 programs (associated with 9 agencies), as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. These programs accounted for a substantial portion of the $141 billion total estimated improper payments for fiscal year 2017. As shown in table 2, 14 of the 18 programs that were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years reported improper payment estimates that accounted for an estimated $74.4 billion (about 53 percent) of the $141 billion, while the other 4 programs did not report improper payment estimates for fiscal year 2017 and were reported by their respective IGs as noncompliant with the IPERA criterion to publish improper payment estimates. The $74.4 billion is primarily composed of estimates reported for 2 noncompliant programs—HHS’s Medicaid program ($36.7 billion) and Treasury’s Earned Income Tax Credit program ($16.2 billion)— totaling $52.9 billion (or approximately 71 percent of the $74.4 billion). Improper payments associated with these two noncompliant programs are also a central part of two areas included in our 2017 High-Risk List, which includes federal programs and operations that are especially vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, or that need transformative change. Eight of the 18 noncompliant programs have been reported as noncompliant since the implementation of IPERA in fiscal year 2011, for a total of 7 consecutive years, as shown in table 2. Reported compliance for Treasury’s Earned Income Tax Credit improved from being reported as noncompliant with multiple IPERA criteria in fiscal year 2013 to noncompliance with only one criterion for the last 4 years (fiscal years 2014 through 2017). Eight CFO Act agencies’ programs were reported as noncompliant under IPERA for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016. Three of these agencies did not notify Congress of their program’s continued noncompliance as required. In addition to submitting the required notifications for their noncompliant programs, the other five agencies also included additional information in their notifications—such as measurable milestones, designation of senior officials, and accountability mechanisms—useful for assessing their efforts to achieve compliance. In June 2018, OMB updated its guidance to clarify agency reporting requirements for each consecutive year a program is reported as noncompliant. However, OMB’s updated guidance did not direct agencies to include other types of quality information in their notifications for programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years that could help Congress to more effectively assess their efforts to address long-standing challenges and other issues affecting these programs and to achieve compliance. Of the eight agencies with programs reported as noncompliant under IPERA for 3 or more consecutive years as of fiscal year 2016, we found that five agencies notified Congress of their noncompliance as required. Specifically, the Department of Defense (DOD), Education, HHS, DHS, and SSA notified Congress of their programs’ reported noncompliance for 3 or more consecutive years as of fiscal year 2016 as required by IPERA and OMB guidance. The remaining three agencies—the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Labor (DOL), and Treasury— did not notify Congress as required. Additional information regarding the three agencies that did not submit their required notifications to Congress is summarized below: USDA: In May 2017, the USDA IG reported that four USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs—Child and Adult Care Food Program; National School Lunch Program; School Breakfast Program; and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children—had been noncompliant for 6 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016. However, USDA has not notified Congress of these programs’ continued noncompliance with IPERA as of fiscal year 2016, despite prior recommendations that we, and the USDA IG, made to USDA to do so. USDA staff stated in May 2018 that USDA drafted, but had not submitted, a letter to Congress regarding these programs’ noncompliance. DOL: In June 2017, the DOL IG reported that the Unemployment Insurance Benefit program had been noncompliant for 6 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016. In October 2016, DOL included proposed legislation in its last notification to Congress regarding this program, approximately 8 months prior to the DOL IG’s IPERA compliance report. However, because the requirement for agencies to notify Congress is triggered by IG reporting of programs that are noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years, DOL should have also notified Congress regarding the program’s continued noncompliance in fiscal year 2016 after the IG’s report was issued in June 2017. DOL staff stated in August 2018 that the proposed legislation included in its October 2016 notification had not been enacted and that DOL is currently working to develop a new report to Congress and OMB detailing corrective actions taken to bring the program into compliance. Treasury: In May 2017, the Treasury IG reported that the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program had been noncompliant for 6 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016. We previously reported that Treasury submitted proposed statutory changes to Congress for this program in August 2014 and in June 2015. As stated in the Treasury IG’s fiscal year 2016 IPERA compliance report, the proposed statutory changes would help prevent the improper issuance of billions of dollars in refunds as it would provide the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with expanded authority to systematically correct erroneous claims that are identified when tax returns are processed and allow IRS to deny erroneous EITC refund claims before they are paid. Further, Treasury stated that IRS has repeatedly requested authority to correct such errors in subsequent fiscal year budgets, including its fiscal year 2019 budget submission. In June 2018, Treasury staff stated that the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided IRS with additional tools for reducing EITC improper payments; however, the act did not expand IRS’s authority to systematically correct the erroneous claims that are identified when tax returns are processed. Treasury staff also stated that the department has continued to coordinate with OMB on required reporting for the EITC program because of the program’s complexity, and that OMB has not requested additional actions or documentation regarding the program’s noncompliance. Although continued coordination with OMB is important, Treasury did not notify Congress regarding the EITC program’s continued noncompliance as required. In summary, despite reporting requirements in IPERA and OMB guidance, one agency (USDA) has not notified Congress about four programs being reported as noncompliant for 6 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016. The remaining two agencies (DOL and Treasury) that did not notify Congress of their programs’ consecutive noncompliance, as of fiscal year 2016, submitted notifications to Congress prior to their respective IGs’ fiscal year 2016 compliance results. However, IPERA requires agencies to notify Congress when programs are reported as noncompliant for more than 3 consecutive years and thus DOL and Treasury should have also notified Congress about their programs’ being reported as noncompliant for 6 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016. It is important that agencies continue to notify Congress of their programs’ consecutive noncompliance each year after the third consecutive year as the information related to their proposals or regarding their IPERA compliance efforts included in prior years’ notifications to Congress may significantly change over time. Unless agencies continue to notify Congress in subsequent years, Congress may lack the current and relevant information needed to effectively assess agencies’ proposals or monitor their efforts to address problematic programs in a timely manner. OMB updated its guidance in June 2018 to provide more clarity regarding the notification requirements for each consecutive year a program is reported as noncompliant. Effective implementation of this guidance may help ensure that agencies consistently provide required information to Congress on these programs in future years. We found that the five agencies—DOD, DHS, Education, HHS, and SSA—that notified Congress regarding their programs’ reported noncompliance for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, also included additional information about their efforts to achieve IPERA compliance. Although IPERA does not specifically require that agency proposals for reauthorization or other statutory change provide such information, including it could help Congress to better assess the agencies’ proposals included in these notifications and to oversee agency efforts to address long-standing challenges and compliance issues associated with these programs. In many instances, the types of additional information provided by these agencies are similar to information that agencies are required to provide to Congress or OMB in other required notifications or other reports, such as annual AFRs or PARs. For example, all improper payment estimates reported under IPIA, as amended, must be accompanied by information on what the agency is doing to reduce improper payments, including a description of root causes and the steps the agency has taken to ensure accountability. Further, IPERA and OMB guidance require agencies to provide corrective action plans to Congress for programs reported as noncompliant for 1 year. Such plans should include actions planned or taken to address the program’s noncompliance, measurable milestones, a senior official designated to oversee progress, and the accountability mechanisms in place to hold the senior official accountable. In addition, GAO’s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the importance of communicating quality information, such as significant matters related to risks, changes, or issues affecting agencies’ efforts to achieve compliance objectives, to external parties—such as legislators, oversight bodies, and the general public. Furthermore, in our fiscal year 2017 High-Risk Update, we also highlight the importance of these types of information when assessing agency efforts to address issues associated with programs included on our High-Risk List. Examples of such information include (1) action plans that are accessible and transparent with clear milestones and metrics, including established goals and performance measures to address identified root causes; (2) leadership commitment of top (or senior) officials to establish long-term priorities and goals and continued oversight and accountability; (3) monitoring progress against goals, assessing program performance, or reporting potential risks; and (4) demonstrated progress, through recommendations implemented, actions taken for improvement, and effectively addressing identified root causes and managing high-risk issues. Table 3 summarizes the types of additional information described above that the five agencies provided in their fiscal year 2016 notifications to Congress to address programs with 3 or more consecutive years of noncompliance. All five agencies informed Congress of (1) root causes that directly lead to improper payments or hindered the program’s ability to achieve compliance; (2) certain risks, significant changes, or issues affecting their efforts; and (3) their corrective actions or strategies to achieve compliance. Three of the five agencies—DOD, Education, and DHS—also included the other types of additional information described above in their notifications, including measurable milestones, designated senior officials to oversee progress, and accountability mechanisms established to help achieve compliance. For example, all three agencies designated their chief financial officers (CFO) to oversee progress toward achieving measurable milestones and expanded their official roles and responsibilities to hold them accountable. Education and DHS stated that these responsibilities were added to their respective CFOs’ individual performance plans. Although OMB updated its guidance in June 2018 to clarify agency reporting requirements related to programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years, the updated guidance did not direct agencies to include other types of quality information in their notifications, such as those described above. In addition, information related to measurable milestones, corrective actions, risks, issues, or other items affecting agencies’ efforts may change significantly over time. With this additional information, Congress could have more complete information to effectively oversee agency efforts to address long-standing challenges and other issues that have contributed to programs being reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. Fifteen programs in seven agencies and 12 programs in six agencies were reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. For agencies reported as noncompliant under IPERA for 2 consecutive years for the same program, IPERA gives the Director of OMB the authority to determine whether additional funding would help the agencies come into compliance. If the OMB Director determines that such funding would help, the agency is required to use any available reprogramming or transfer authority to meet the funding level that the OMB Director specified and, if such authorities are not sufficient, submit a request to Congress for additional reprogramming or transfer authority. According to OMB staff, OMB determined that no additional funding was needed for programs reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years as of fiscal year 2016. As of September 2018, OMB was in the process of making funding determinations for 12 programs that were reported as noncompliant as of fiscal year 2017 and stated that any determinations made would be developed in the President’s Budget for fiscal year 2020. The 12 programs reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2017, accounted for approximately $3 billion (2 percent) of the $141 billion total improper payment estimate for that year. Of these 12 programs, more than half (or 7 of the 12) were attributable to DOD; however, Education’s Pell Grant program accounted for $2.2 billion (or 74 percent) of the $3 billion in improper payment estimates for programs reported as noncompliant programs for 2 consecutive years, for fiscal year 2017. In addition, as shown in table 4, the 12 programs reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2017, were primarily noncompliant with the IPERA criteria that required agencies to publish information in their PAR or AFR or publish and meet reduction targets. As noted previously, IPERA gives OMB authority to determine whether additional funding for intensified compliance efforts would help the agency come into compliance under IPERA. Therefore, an established process for making timely, well-informed funding determinations is an essential part of ensuring that agencies have sufficient resources and take steps to intensify their compliance efforts in a timely manner. In April 2018, OMB staff stated that when making funding determinations, they primarily rely on the IGs’ recommendations in their annual IPERA compliance reports. OMB staff also stated that for its fiscal year 2016 determinations, OMB determined that additional funding was not needed because the IGs’ recommendations did not specify that additional funding was needed to help resolve the programs’ noncompliance. The IGs’ annual reports provide information on agencies’ IPERA compliance and may be useful to OMB as a tool to help them make determinations for additional funding. However, IPERA does not require IGs to address funding levels in their annual compliance reports, and OMB’s guidance does not inform the IGs that their work might be relied upon in this manner. We reviewed the IGs’ fiscal years 2016 and 2017 IPERA compliance reports for the agencies with programs reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years and found that the IGs did not make any recommendations regarding additional funding needed to bring these programs into compliance. In addition, as specifically stated by the IGs for Education and USDA in their IPERA reports, OMB has the statutory responsibility to make these funding determinations. Education IG’s fiscal year 2017 IPERA compliance report stated that “If OMB recommends that the Department needs additional funding or should take any other actions to become compliant with IPERA, we recommend that the Department implement OMB’s recommendations.” Also, the USDA IG’s fiscal year 2016 IPERA compliance report stated, “For agencies that are not compliant for 2 consecutive years for the same program, the Director of OMB will determine if additional funding would help these programs come into compliance.” As a result, OMB’s reliance on IG recommendations as the source of information to support additional funding determinations may not provide sufficient information to effectively assess agencies’ funding needs to address noncompliance. OMB staff subsequently stated that they no longer need to conduct a detailed review of the IGs’ IPERA compliance reports to identify recommendations related to additional funding needs. Instead, OMB Memorandum M-18-20, issued in June 2018, updated OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C, and clarified that the funding determination process will unfold as part of the annual development of the President’s Budget, as described in OMB Circular No. A-11. This updated guidance also directs agencies to submit proposals to OMB regarding additional funding needs that may help them address IPERA noncompliance. To illustrate, under this new guidance, the IGs’ fiscal year 2018 IPERA compliance reports will be due in May 2019, and any funding needs to address noncompliance would be incorporated in the next annual budget preparation process, the results of which are due to be submitted to Congress in February 2020 for the President’s Budget for fiscal year 2021. Once OMB’s determinations have been made and communicated to agencies, agencies would respond by performing the required reprogramming and making transfers under existing authority, where available. Any requests for additional transfer authority may be incorporated into subsequent appropriations legislation. Estimated improper payments reported government-wide total almost $1.4 trillion from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2017. The number of programs reported as noncompliant under IPERA for 3 or more consecutive years has continued to increase, from 12 programs (associated with 7 agencies) to 18 programs (associated with 9 agencies) as of fiscal years 2015 and 2017, respectively. Including additional useful, up-to-date information—such as measurable milestones, risks, or other issues affecting agency efforts to achieve compliance—in notifications to Congress, which are required when programs are reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years, could help Congress better assess agency efforts to address long-standing challenges and other issues associated with them. Although certain agencies included certain types of additional information in their notifications as of fiscal year 2016, OMB guidance does not require agencies to include such information in their notifications. As a result, Congress may lack sufficient information to effectively oversee agency efforts and take prompt action to help address long-standing challenges or other issues associated with these programs. The Director of OMB should take steps to update OMB guidance to specify other types of quality information that agencies with programs noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years should include in their notifications to Congress, such as significant matters related to risks, issues, root causes, measurable milestones, designated senior officials, accountability mechanisms, and corrective actions or strategies planned or taken by agencies to achieve compliance. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to OMB and requested comments, and OMB said that it had no comments. We also provided a draft of this report to the 24 CFO Act agencies and their IGs and requested comments. We received letters from the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), SSA, and the United States Agency for International Development. These letters are reproduced in appendixes V through VII. We also received technical comments from DOL, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the General Services Administration, HHS, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Treasury OIG, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate. The remaining agencies and OIGs either did not provide comments or notified us via email that they had no comments. In its comments, SSA stated that it provided information to Congress on measurable milestones, designated senior officials, and accountability mechanisms in its AFR. In the report, we acknowledge that these types of additional information are similar to information that agencies are required to provide to Congress or OMB in other reports, such as annual AFRs. However, our analysis was based on SSA’s fiscal year 2016 notifications to Congress for programs reported as noncompliant under IPERA, in which this specific information was not reported. As such, we continue to believe that OMB should take steps to update OMB guidance to help ensure that agencies report such significant information and include it in their notifications to Congress. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions on matters discussed in this report, please contact me at (202) 512-2623 or davisbh@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VIII. Our objectives were to determine the following: 1. The extent to which the 24 agencies listed in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended (CFO Act), complied with the six criteria listed in the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and the trends evident since 2011, as reported by their inspectors general (IG). 2. The extent to which CFO Act agencies addressed requirements for programs and activities reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, and communicated their strategies to Congress for reducing improper payments and achieving compliance. 3. The extent to which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) made determinations regarding whether additional funding would help CFO Act programs and activities reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, come into compliance. Although the responsibility for complying with provisions of improper payment-related statutes rests with the head of each executive agency, we focused on the 24 agencies listed in the CFO Act because estimates of their improper payments represent over 99 percent of the total reported estimated improper payments for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Our work did not include validating or retesting the data or methodologies that the IGs used to determine and report compliance. We corroborated all of our findings with OMB and all 24 CFO Act agencies and IGs. To address our first objective, we identified the requirements that agencies must meet by reviewing the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), IPERA, and OMB guidance. We reviewed the CFO Act agency IGs’ IPERA compliance reports for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, which were the most current reports available at the time of our review. We summarized the overall agency and program-specific compliance determinations with the six IPERA criteria, as reported by the IGs. For fiscal years 2011 through 2015, we relied on and reviewed prior year supporting documentation and analyses of CFO Act agencies’ IPERA compliance, as reported in our prior reports, in order to identify compliance trends since 2011, as reported by the IGs. Based on these reports, we summarized the programs and the number of consecutive years that they were reported as noncompliant. For each IG report that did not specifically state that the agency had programs noncompliant for consecutive years, we compared the list of programs reported as noncompliant for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to the list of programs reported as noncompliant for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 in our prior reports. Lastly, we corroborated our findings with OMB and all 24 CFO Act agencies and IGs. To address our second objective, we determined if the agencies responsible for programs and activities reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years as of fiscal year 2016 had submitted the required proposals (reauthorizations or statutory changes) to Congress by requesting and reviewing documentation of the required submissions and relevant notifications to Congress obtained from each applicable agency. Further, we reviewed the content of each agency notification to evaluate agencies’ efforts to communicate quality information to Congress concerning their strategies for achieving compliance consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. Principle 15 of these standards emphasizes the need for an entity’s management to communicate necessary quality information, such as significant matters related to risks, changes, or issues affecting agencies’ efforts, to achieve compliance objectives, to external parties—such as legislators, oversight bodies, and the general public. To identify other types of information useful for this purpose, we reviewed IPIA, as amended; IPERA; and OMB guidance for information agencies are required to provide to Congress or OMB in other notifications and reports, such as their corrective action plans or strategies, measurable milestones, designated senior officials, and accountability mechanisms for achieving compliance. We also reviewed information used to assess agency efforts to address issues associated with programs on our High-Risk List. To determine the extent to which agencies’ notifications to Congress included these additional types of useful information for their applicable program(s), we used a data collection instrument to document our determinations regarding the additional types of quality information included in each notification. In addition, two GAO analysts independently reviewed each agency’s notification and documented their determinations regarding the types of information included in the notifications. Differences between the analysts’ determinations were identified and resolved to ensure that the types of additional information were consistently identified and categorized. We did not evaluate the sufficiency and completeness of the agency-provided information. Lastly, we corroborated our findings with the respective agencies and IGs. To address our third objective, we identified provisions in IPIA, IPERA, and OMB guidance that are applicable to OMB for programs reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years. To determine if OMB made additional funding determinations for agency programs and activities reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, we requested relevant information and communications from OMB and the applicable agencies and IGs. We also interviewed key OMB staff on their process for determining additional funding needs for noncompliant programs and activities as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and related results. In addition, we reviewed the applicable fiscal years 2016 and 2017 CFO Act agency IG IPERA compliance reports, which OMB staff stated they relied on for determining whether noncompliant programs and activities required additional funding. We also asked the agencies whether they coordinated with OMB regarding their need for additional funding for programs and activities reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Lastly, we corroborated our findings with OMB and the respective agencies and IGs. We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to December 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Figure 4 details the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies’ overall compliance under the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), as reported by their inspectors general, for fiscal years 2011 through 2017. We previously reported on CFO Act agencies’ overall reported compliance for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Tables 5 and 6 detail the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies and programs reported by their inspectors general as noncompliant with the six criteria specified by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. We previously reported on CFO Act agencies’ reported compliance with the six IPERA criteria for fiscal year 2015. Table 7 details the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies and programs reported by their inspectors general as noncompliant under the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) for 2 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017. We previously reported on CFO Act agencies’ reported compliance for fiscal year 2015. In addition to the contact named above, Michelle Philpott (Assistant Director), Matthew Valenta (Assistant Director), Vivian Ly (Auditor in Charge), Juvy Chaney, John Craig, Caitlin Cusati, Francine DelVecchio, Patrick Frey, Maria Hasan, Maxine Hattery, Jason Kelly, Jim Kernen, Jason Kirwan, Sharon Kittrell, Lisa Motley, Heena Patel, Anne Rhodes- Kline, and Kailey Schoenholtz made key contributions to this report.", "answers": ["Government-wide estimated improper payments totaled almost $1.4 trillion from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2017. IPERA requires IGs to annually assess and report on whether executive branch agencies complied with the six criteria to (1) publish an agency financial report or performance accountability report, (2) conduct program-specific improper payment risk assessments, (3) publish improper payment estimates, (4) publish corrective action plans, (5) publish and meet annual improper payment reduction targets, and (6) report a gross improper payment rate of less than 10 percent. This report examines the extent to which 1. CFO Act agencies complied with IPERA criteria for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and the trends evident since 2011, as reported by their IGs; 2. CFO Act agencies addressed requirements for programs reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, and communicated their strategies to Congress for reducing improper payments and achieving compliance; and 3. OMB made determinations regarding whether additional funding would help CFO Act agency programs reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, come into compliance. GAO analyzed the IGs' fiscal years 2016 and 2017 IPERA compliance reports; reviewed prior GAO reports on agencies' IPERA compliance; reviewed agency information submitted to Congress; and made inquiries to OMB, applicable agencies, and IGs; and assessed such information based on relevant IPERA provisions and OMB and other guidance. Over half of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies were reported by their inspectors general (IG) as noncompliant with one or more criteria under the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Nine CFO Act agencies have been reported as noncompliant in one or more programs every year since the implementation of IPERA in fiscal year 2011, totaling 7 consecutive years of noncompliance. The IGs of the 14 noncompliant agencies reported that a total of 58 programs were responsible for the identified instances of noncompliance in fiscal year 2017. Further, 18 of the 58 programs at 9 agencies were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. Fourteen of these 18 programs accounted for an estimated $74.4 billion of the $141 billion total estimated improper payments for fiscal year 2017; the other 4 programs did not report improper payment estimates. This sum may include estimates that are of unknown reliability. The $74.4 billion is primarily composed of estimates reported for two noncompliant programs, the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicaid program and the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Earned Income Tax Credit program; estimated improper payments for these two programs are also a central part of certain high-risk areas in GAO's 2017 High-Risk List. Agencies with any program reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years are required to notify Congress of their program's consecutive noncompliance and submit a proposal for reauthorization or statutory change to bring that program into compliance. GAO found that three agencies with one or more programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, did not notify Congress or submit the required proposals. The Departments of Labor and the Treasury submitted proposed legislative changes in response to their programs being previously reported as noncompliant, but did not notify Congress of the programs' continued noncompliance as of fiscal year 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not notified Congress despite prior GAO and USDA IG recommendations to do so. To address these issues, in June 2018 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated its guidance to clarify the notification requirements for each consecutive year a program is reported as noncompliant. GAO found that five agencies did notify Congress as required, and included additional quality information that is not specifically required, but could be useful in updating Congress on their compliance efforts. For example, all five agencies provided information on the root causes, risks, changes, or issues affecting their efforts and corrective actions or strategies to address them; three agencies provided other quality information on accountability mechanisms, designated senior officials, and measurable milestones. In June 2018, OMB updated its guidance to clarify agency reporting requirements for programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. However, the updated guidance does not direct agencies to include the types of quality information included in these five agencies' notifications for fiscal year 2016. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the importance of communicating quality information, such as significant matters affecting agencies' efforts to achieve compliance objectives. Such information could be useful in understanding the current challenges of these programs and is essential for assessing agency efforts to address high-risk and other issues. As a result, Congress could have more complete information to effectively oversee agency efforts to address program noncompliance for 3 or more consecutive years. When programs are reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, IPERA gives OMB authority to determine whether additional funding is needed to help resolve the noncompliance. In April 2018, OMB staff stated that they determined that no additional funding was needed for the 15 programs that were reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, and that they primarily rely on the IGs' recommendations in their annual IPERA compliance reports when making funding determinations. OMB staff subsequently stated that they no longer need to conduct a detailed review of the IGs' IPERA compliance reports to identify recommendations related to additional funding needs. Instead, OMB updated its guidance in June 2018 to direct agencies to submit proposals to OMB regarding additional funding needs to help address IPERA noncompliance and clarified that the funding determination process will unfold as part of the annual development of the President's Budget. As of September 2018, OMB was in the process of making funding determinations for 12 programs that were reported as noncompliant as of fiscal year 2017 and stated that any determinations made would be developed in the President's Budget for fiscal year 2020. GAO recommends that OMB update its guidance to specify other types of quality information that agencies with programs noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years should include in their notifications to Congress, such as significant matters related to risks, issues, root causes, measurable milestones, designated senior officials, accountability mechanisms, and corrective actions or strategies planned or taken by agencies to achieve compliance. GAO provided a draft of this report to OMB and requested comments, and OMB said that it had no comments. GAO also provided a draft of this report to the 24 CFO Act agencies and their IGs and requested comments. In its written comments, the Social Security Administration (SSA) stated that it provided information on measurable milestones, designated senior officials, and accountability mechanisms in its agency financial report. However, SSA did not provide this information in its notifications to Congress for programs reported as noncompliant under IPERA as of fiscal year 2016. GAO believes that OMB should take steps to update OMB's guidance to help ensure that agencies report such significant information and include it in their notifications to Congress. In addition, several agencies and IGs provided technical comments, which were incorporated in the report as appropriate."], "length": 7177, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b95961dee2a7d15fab177df45adb9f812ec28e870f216c35"}
{"input": "", "context": "Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA; P.L. 95-128 , 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) in response to concerns that federally insured banking institutions were not making sufficient credit available in the local areas in which they were chartered and acquiring deposits. According to some in Con gress, the granting of a public bank charter should translate into a continuing obligation for that bank to serve the credit needs of the public where it was chartered. Consequently, the CRA was enacted to \"re-affirm the obligation of federally chartered or insured financial institutions to serve the convenience and needs of their service areas\" and \"to help meet the credit needs of the localities in which they are chartered, consistent with the prudent operation of the institution.\" The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether a bank is meeting local credit needs. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas and entities—that occur within assessment areas (where institutions have local deposit-taking operations). These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating from a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). The CRA requires federal banking regulators to take those ratings into account when institutions apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions, or seek to take other actions that require regulatory approval. Congress became concerned with the geographical mismatch of deposit-taking and lending activities for a variety of reasons. Deposits serve as a primary source of borrowed funds that banks may use to facilitate their lending. Hence, there was concern that banks were using deposits collected from local neighborhoods to fund out-of-state as well as various international lending activities at the expense of addressing the local area's housing, agricultural, and small business credit needs. Another motivation for congressional action was to discourage redlining practices. One type of redlining can be defined as the refusal of a bank to make credit available to all of the neighborhoods in its immediate locality, including LMI neighborhoods where the bank may have collected deposits. A second type of redlining is the practice of denying a creditworthy applicant a loan for housing located in a certain neighborhood even though the applicant may qualify for a similar loan in another neighborhood. This type of redlining pertains to circumstances in which a bank refuses to serve all of the residents in an area, perhaps due to discrimination. The CRA applies to banking institutions with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), such as national banks, savings associations, and state-chartered commercial and savings banks. The CRA does not apply to credit unions, insurance companies, securities companies, and other nonbank institutions because of the differences in their financial business models. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC administer the CRA, which is implemented via Regulation BB. The CRA requires federal banking regulatory agencies to evaluate the extent to which regulated institutions are effectively meeting the credit needs within their designated assessment areas, including LMI neighborhoods, in a manner consistent with the federal prudential regulations for safety and soundness . The CRA's impact on lending activity has been publicly debated. Some observers are concerned that the CRA may induce banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in nontargeted neighborhoods by encouraging a disproportionate amount of lending in LMI communities. Furthermore, some argue that the CRA compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers that are more likely to have repayment problems, which may subsequently compromise the financial stability of the banking system. For example, some researchers have attributed the increase in risky lending prior to the 2007-2009 recession to banks attempting to comply with CRA objectives. Others are concerned that enforcement of CRA objectives has not been stringent enough to compel banks to increase financial services in LMI areas. Almost all banks receive Satisfactory or better performance ratings (discussed in more detail below) on their CRA examinations, which some may consider indicative of weak enforcement. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI customers. It begins with a description of bank CRA examinations, including how a bank delineates its assessment area; the activities that may qualify for points under the three tests (i.e., lending, investment, and service) that collectively make up the CRA examination; and how the composite CRA rating is calculated. Next, the report analyzes the difficulty in attributing bank lending decisions to CRA incentives. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that CRA compliance does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. Without explicit benchmarks, linking the composition of banks' loan portfolios to either too strong or too weak CRA enforcement is difficult. Banks are also unlikely to get CRA credit for all of the loans they make to LMI customers. Specifically, higher-risk loans that banking regulators explicitly discourage are unlikely to be eligible for CRA consideration. Furthermore, greater mobility of lending and deposit-taking activity across regional boundaries due to various financial market innovations has complicated the ability to geographically link various financial activities. Hence, many banks' financial activities occurring in a designated assessment area that are eligible for CRA consideration may simply be profitable, meaning they may have occurred without the CRA incentive. Finally, this report summarizes recent policy discussions regarding modernization of the CRA. As noted above, the federal banking regulators conduct regular examinations of banks to assess whether they meet local credit needs in designated assessment areas. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, when banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur within assessment areas. Regulation BB provides the criteria that a bank's board of directors must use to determine the assessment area(s) in which its primary regulator will conduct its CRA examination. The assessment area typically has a geographical definition—the location of a bank's main office, branches, and deposit-taking automatic teller machines, as well as surrounding areas where the bank originates and purchases a substantial portion of loans. Assessment areas must generally include at least one metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or at least one contiguous political subdivision, such as a county, city, or town. Regulation BB also requires that assessment areas may not reflect illegal discrimination, arbitrarily exclude LMI geographies, and extend substantially beyond an MSA boundary or a state boundary (unless the assessment area is located in a multistate MSA). Banking regulators regularly review a bank's assessment area delineations for compliance with Regulation BB requirements as part of the CRA examination. Instead of a more conventionally delineated assessment area, certain banking firms may obtain permission to devise a strategic plan for compliance with Regulation BB requirements. For example, wholesale and limited purpose banks are specialized banks with nontraditional business models. Wholesale banks provide services to larger clients, such as large corporations and other financial institutions; they generally do not provide financial services to retail clients, such as individuals and small businesses. Limited purpose banks offer a narrow product line (e.g., concentration in credit card lending) rather than provide a wider range of financial products and services. These banking firms typically apply to their primary regulators to request designation as a wholesale or limited purpose bank and, for CRA examination purposes, are evaluated under strategic plan options that have been tailored for their distinctive capacities, business strategies, and expertise. The option to develop a strategic plan of pre-defined CRA performance goals is available to any bank subject to the CRA. The public is allowed time (e.g., 30 days) to provide input on the draft of a bank's strategic plan, after which the bank submits the plan to its primary regulator for approval (within 60 days after the application is received). Regulation BB does not impose lending quotas or benchmarks. Instead, Regulation BB provides banks with a wide variety of options to serve the needs of their assessment areas. Qualifying CRA activities include mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. For example, banks may receive CRA credits for such activities as investing in special purpose community development entities (CDEs), which facilitate capital investments in LMI communities (discussed below); providing support (e.g., consulting, detailing an employee, processing transactions for free or at a discounted rate, and providing office facilities) to minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions (MWLIs), thereby enhancing their ability to serve LMI customers; serving as a joint lender for a loan originated by MWLIs; facilitating financial literacy education to LMI communities, including any support of efforts of MWLIs and CDEs to provide financial literacy education; opening or maintaining bank branches and other transactions facilities in LMI communities and designated disaster areas; providing low-cost education loans to low-income borrowers; and offering international remittance services in LMI communities. The examples listed above are not comprehensive, but they illustrate several activities banks may engage in to obtain consideration for CRA credits. The banking regulators will consider awarding CRA credits or points to a bank if its qualifying activities occur within an assigned assessment area. The points are then used to compute a bank's overall composite CRA rating. Regulators apply up to three tests, which are known as the lending , investment , and service tests, respectively, to determine whether a bank is meeting local credit need in designated assessment areas. The lending test evaluates the number, amount, and distribution across income and geographic classifications of a bank's mortgage, small business, small farm, and consumer loans. The investment test grades a bank's community development investments in the assessment area. The service test examines a bank's retail service delivery, such as the availability of branches and low-cost checking in the assessment area. The point system for bank performance under the lending, investment, and service tests is illustrated in Table 1 . The lending test is generally regarded as the most important of the three tests, awarding banks the most points (CRA credits) in all rating categories. As shown in Table 1 , banks receive fewer credits for making CRA-qualified investments than for providing direct loans to individuals under the lending test. In some instances, an activity may qualify for more than one of the performance tests. Federal banking regulators evaluate financial institutions based upon their capacity, constraints, and business strategies; demographic and economic data; lending, investment, and service opportunities; and benchmark against competitors and peers. Because these factors vary across banks, the CRA examination was customized in 1995 to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised to include small , intermediate small , and large banks. The bank regulators also indexed the asset size thresholds—which are adjusted annually—to inflation using the Consumer Price Index. As of January 1, 2019, a small bank is defined as having less than $1.284 billion in assets as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years; an intermediate small bank has at least $321 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years but less than $1.284 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years; and a large bank has $1.284 billion or more in assets. Small banks are typically evaluated under the lending test. Regulators review (1) loan-to-deposit ratios; (2) percentage of loans in an assessment area; (3) lending to borrowers of different incomes and in different amounts; (4) geographical distribution of loans; and (5) actions on complaints about performance. Intermediate small banks are subject to both the lending and investment tests. Large banks are subject to all three tests. As mentioned previously, direct lending to borrowers, taking place in what is referred to as primary lending markets , qualify for CRA credit under the lending test. Investments taking place in secondary lending markets , in which investors purchase loans that have already been originated (such that little or no direct interaction occurs between investors and borrowers), qualify for CRA credit under the investment test. Secondary market investors may assume the default risk associated with a loan if the entire loan is purchased. Alternatively, if a set of loans are pooled together, then numerous secondary investors may purchase financial securities in which the returns are generated by the principal and interest repayments from the underlying loan pool, thereby sharing the lending risk. Direct ownership of loans or purchases of smaller portions (debt securities) of a pool of loans, therefore, are simply alternative methods to facilitate lending. As shown in Table 1 above, a bank may receive CRA consideration under the lending test for making a loan to LMI individuals that is guaranteed by a federal agency, such as the Federal Home Administration (FHA). If, however, a bank purchases securities backed by pools of FHA-guaranteed mortgage originations, this activity receives credit under the investment test. Thus, the bank receives less CRA credit when the financial risk is shared with other lenders than it would for making a direct loan (and holding all of the lending risk) even though it would still facilitate lending to LMI borrowers. In 2005, the activities that qualify for CRA credit were expanded to encourage banks to make public welfare investments. More specifically, qualifying activities include a public welfare investment (PWI) that promotes the public welfare by providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals; and a community development investment (CDI), economic development investment , or project that meets the PWI requirements. Examples of CDI activities include promoting affordable housing, financing small businesses and farms, and conducting activities that revitalize LMI areas. Banks may engage in certain activities that typically would not be permitted under other banking laws as long as these activities promote the public welfare and do not expose institutions to unlimited liability. For example, banks generally are not allowed to make direct purchases of the preferred or common equity shares of other banking firms; however, banks may purchase equity shares of institutions with a primary mission of community development (discussed in more detail in the Appendix ) up to an allowable CDI limit. The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-351 ) increased the amount that national banking associations and state banks (that are members of the Federal Reserve System) may invest in a single institution from 10% to 15% of a bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. CDIs that benefit a bank's designated assessment area may qualify for CRA credit. For CRA purposes, the definition of a CDI was expanded in 2005 to include \"underserved and distressed\" rural areas and \"designated disaster areas\" to aid the regional rebuilding from severe hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, tornados, and other disasters. The disaster area provision allows banks anywhere in America to receive consideration for CRA credit if they facilitate making credit available to a distressed location or geographic area outside of their own assessment areas. Thus, the 2005 revisions to the PWI and CDI definitions made more banking activities eligible for CRA credits. The banking regulators would consider awarding full CRA credits under the lending test to banks that make CDI loans directly in their assessment areas. Under the investment test, however, the banking regulators may choose to prorate the credits awarded to indirect investments. The Appendix provides examples of CDI activities that would qualify for CRA consideration under the investment test. Any awarded CRA credits could be prorated given that investing banks typically would have less control over when and where the funds are loaned. The CRA was revised in 1989 to require descriptive CRA composite performance ratings that must be disclosed to the public. The composite ratings illustrated in Table 2 are tabulated using the points assigned from the individual tests (shown in Table 1 above). Grades of Outstanding and Satisfactory are acceptable; Satisfactory ratings in both community development and retail lending are necessary for a composite Satisfactory . Large banks must receive a sufficient amount of points from the investment and service tests to receive a composite Outstanding rating. Regulators include CRA ratings as a factor when lenders request permission to engage in certain activities, such as moving offices or buying another institution. Denying requests, particularly applications for mergers and acquisitions, is a mechanism that may be applied against banking organizations with ratings below Satisfactory . In 2005, the banking regulators also ruled that any evidence of discrimination or credit practices that violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation by any affiliate would adversely affect an agency's evaluation of a bank's CRA performance. Applicants with poor ratings may resubmit their applications after making the necessary improvements. Covered institutions must post a CRA notice in their main offices and make publicly available a record of their composite CRA performance. Given that the CRA is not a federal assistance program and that several regulators implement it separately, no single federal agency is responsible for evaluating its overall effectiveness. In 2000, Congress directed the Federal Reserve to study the CRA's effectiveness. The Federal Reserve's study reported that lending to LMI families had increased since the CRA's enactment but found it was not possible to directly attribute all of that increase to the CRA. For example, advancements in underwriting over the past several decades have enabled lenders to better predict and price borrower default risk, thus making credit available to borrowers that might have been rejected prior to such technological advances. This section examines the difficulty linking bank lending outcomes directly to the CRA, considering questions raised about the subjectivity of the CRA examination itself, whether prudential regulators use CRA to encourage banks to engage in high-risk lending, and whether the increased lending to LMI borrowers since CRA's enactment can be attributed to other profit-incentives that exist apart from the CRA. Questions have been raised as to whether the CRA examination itself is effective at measuring a bank's ability to meet local credit needs. For example, the CRA examinations have an element of subjectivity in terms of measuring both the quality and quantity of CRA compliance. In terms of quality, regulators determine the \"innovativeness or flexibility\" of qualified loan products; the \"innovativeness or complexity\" of qualified investments; or the \"innovativeness\" of ways banks service groups of customers previously not served. The number of points some CRA-qualifying investments receive relative to others is up to the regulator's judgment given that no formal definition of innovativeness has been established (although regulators provide a variety of examples as guidelines for banks to follow). In terms of quantity, there is no official quota indicating when banks have done enough CRA-qualified activities to receive a particular rating. Without specific definitions of the criteria or quotas, the CRA examination may be considered subjective. Almost all banks pass their CRA examinations. Figure 1 shows the average annual composite scores of banks that received CRA examinations as well as the annual number of bank examinations by size. In general, most banks receive a composite Satisfactory or better rating regardless of the number of banks examined in a year. For all years, approximately 97% or more of banks examined received ratings of Satisfactory or Outstanding . Whether the consistently high ratings reflect the CRA's influence on bank behavior or whether the CRA examination procedures need improvement is difficult to discern. Another issue raised is whether the CRA has resulted in banks making more high-risk loans given that it encourages banks to lend to LMI individuals (perhaps under the presumption that LMI individuals are less creditworthy relative to higher-income individuals). Since passage of the CRA, however, innovations have allowed lenders to better evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers (e.g., credit scoring, the adoption of automated underwriting), thus enhancing credit availability to both high credit quality and credit-impaired individuals. Credit-impaired borrowers can be charged higher interest rates and fees than those with better credit histories to compensate lenders for taking on greater amounts of credit or default risk. Nontraditional loan products (e.g., interest-only, initially low interest rate) allow borrowers to obtain lower regular payments during the early stages of the loan, perhaps under the expectation that their financial circumstances may improve in the later stages as the loan payments adjust to reflect the true costs. The ability to charge higher prices or offer such nontraditional loan products may result in greater higher-risk lending. Because these technological developments in the financial industry occurred after enactment of the CRA, banks' willingness to enter into higher-risk lending markets arguably cannot be attributed solely to the CRA. Regulators arguably are more reluctant to award banks CRA credit for originating higher-risk loans given the scrutiny necessary to determine whether higher loan prices reflect elevated default risk levels or discriminatory or predatory lending practices. Primary bank regulators are concerned with both prudential regulation and consumer protection. It is difficult for regulators to monitor how well borrowers understood the disclosures regarding loan costs and features, or whether any discriminatory or predatory behavior occurred at the time of loan origination. Regulators use fair lending examinations to determine whether loan pricing practices have been applied fairly and consistently across applicants or if some steering to higher-priced loan products occurred. Nevertheless, although it is not impossible for banks to receive CRA credits for making some higher-priced loans, regulators are mindful of practices such as improper consumer disclosure, steering, or discrimination that inflate loan prices. Prudential regulators are also unlikely to encourage lending practices that might result in large concentrations of high-risk loans on bank balance sheets. Hence, certain lending activities—subprime mortgages and payday lending—have been explicitly discouraged by bank regulators, as discussed in more detail below. Although no consensus definition has emerged for subprime lending, this practice may generally be described as lending to borrowers with weak credit at higher costs relative to borrowers of higher credit quality. In September 2006, the banking regulatory agencies issued guidance on subprime lending that was restrictive in tone. The guidance warned banks of the risk posed by nontraditional mortgage loans, including interest-only and payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages. The agencies expressed concern about these loans because of the lack of principal amortization and the potential for negative amortization. Consequently, a study of 2006 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data reported that banks subject to the CRA and their affiliates originated or purchased only 6% of the reported high-cost loans made to lower-income borrowers within their CRA assessment areas. Banks, therefore, received little or no CRA credit for subprime mortgage lending. Instead, federal regulators offered CRA consideration to banks that helped mitigate the effects of distressed subprime mortgages. On April 17, 2007, federal regulators provided examples of various arrangements that financial firms could provide to LMI borrowers to help them transition into affordable mortgages and avoid foreclosure. The various workout arrangements were eligible for favorable CRA consideration. Banks are unlikely to receive CRA consideration for originating subprime mortgages going forward. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203 ) requires lenders to consider consumers' ability to repay before extending them mortgage credit, and one way for lenders to comply is to originate qualified mortgages (QMs) that satisfy various underwriting and product-feature requirements. For example, QMs may not have any negative amortization features, interest-only payments, or points and fees that exceed specified caps of the total loan amount; in most cases, borrowers' debt-to-income ratios shall not exceed 43%. QM originations will give lenders legal protections if the required income verification and other proper underwriting procedures were followed. Given the legal protections afforded to QMs, some banks might show greater reluctance toward making non-QM loans. With this in mind, the federal banking regulators announced that banks choosing to make only or predominately QM loans should not expect to see an adverse effect on their CRA evaluations; however, the regulators did not indicate that CRA consideration would be given for non-QMs. Arguably, the federal banking regulators appear less inclined to use the CRA to encourage lending that could be subject to greater legal risks. Banks have demonstrated interest in providing financial services such as small dollar cash advances, which are similar to payday loans, in the form of subprime credit cards, overdraft protection services, and direct deposit advances. However, banks are discouraged from engaging in payday and similar forms of lending. Legislation, such as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-24 ), placed restrictions on subprime credit card lending. In addition, federal banking regulators expressed concern when banks began offering deposit advance products due to the similarities to payday loans. Specifically, on April 25, 2013, the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve expressed concerns that the high costs and repeated extensions of credit could add to borrower default risks and issued final supervisory guidance regarding the delivery of these products. Many banks subsequently discontinued offering deposit advances. In general, these legislative and regulatory efforts explicitly discourage banks from offering high-cost consumer financial products and thus such products are unlikely to receive CRA consideration. When various financial products are deemed unsound by bank regulators and not offered by banks, a possible consequence may be that some customers migrate to nonbank institutions willing to provide these higher-cost products. Accordingly, the effectiveness of the CRA diminishes if more individuals choose to seek financial products from nonbank institutions. In general, it can be difficult to determine the extent to which banks' financial decisions are motivated by CRA incentives, profit incentives, or both. Compliance with CRA does not require banks to make unprofitable, high-risk loans that would threaten the financial health of the bank. Instead, CRA loans have profit potential; and bank regulators require all loans, including CRA loans, to be prudently underwritten. As evidenced below, it may be difficult to determine whether banks have made particular financial decisions in response to profit or CRA incentives in cases where those incentives exist simultaneously. For example, banks increased their holdings of municipal bonds in 2009. Although banks may receive CRA consideration under the investment test for purchasing state and local municipal bonds that fund public and community development projects in their designated assessment areas, banks may choose this investment for reasons unrelated to CRA. During recessions, for example, banks may reduce direct (or primary market) lending activities and increase their holdings of securities in the wake of declining demand for and supply of direct loan originations that occur during economic slowdowns and early recovery periods. In addition, a provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided banks with a favorable tax incentive to invest in municipal bonds in the wake of the 2007-2009 recession. Hence, determining whether banks increased their municipal holdings because of a turn to securities markets for higher yields following a recession, a favorable tax incentive, or the CRA incentive is challenging. Similarly, banks increased their investments in Small Business Investment Corporations (SBICs, defined in the Appendix ) in 2010. Investments in SBICs allow banks to provide subordinate financing (rather than senior debt) to businesses. Senior lenders have first claims to the business's assets in case of failure; however, subordinate financiers provide funds in the form of mezzanine capital or equity, requiring a higher return because they are repaid after senior lenders. Banks generally are not allowed to act as subordinate financiers because they are not allowed to acquire ownership interests in private equity funds, unless such investments promote public welfare. Hence, attributing community development financing activities, such as SBIC investments, to CRA incentives may arguably be easier (relative to other financing activities) because the ability to engage in subordinate financing activities typically represents a CRA exemption from ordinary permissible banking activities. Following the 2007-2009 recession, however, U.S. interest rates dropped to historically low levels for an abnormally long period of time. Because low-yielding interest rate environments squeeze profits, banks were likely to search for higher-yielding and larger-sized lending opportunities, such as investments in SBICs. Hence, it remains difficult to determine whether a particular bank's decision to increase SBIC financing activities was driven by normal profit or CRA-related incentives. Between June 2016 and June 2017, more than 1700 U.S. bank branches were closed. Many branch closings occurred primarily in rural and low-income tract areas, raising concerns that banks would be able to circumvent their CRA obligation to lend and be evaluated in these areas. A traditional bank business model, however, relies primarily on having access to core deposits , a stable source of funds used to subsequently originate loans. Banks value geographic locations with greater potential to attract high core deposit volumes, which is also consistent with the CRA's requirement that assessment areas include at least one MSA or contiguous political subdivision (as previously discussed). Furthermore, using FDIC and U.S. Census Bureau data, the Federal Reserve noted that the number of branches per capita in 2017 was higher than two decades ago. Hence, determining whether branch closures reflect a bank's intentions to circumvent CRA compliance or to facilitate its ability to attract core deposits is challenging. On April 3, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) released recommendations to modernize CRA in a memorandum to the federal banking regulators (OCC, FCIC, and the Fed). Treasury highlighted four of its recommendations, summarized below. When the CRA was enacted in 1977, banks received deposits and made loans primarily through geographical branches. Assessment areas defined geographically arguably may not fully reflect the community served by a bank because of technology developments, such as the internet and mobile phone banking, prompting Treasury to call for revisiting the approach for determining banks' assessment areas. In 2016, the banking regulators issued Interagency Questions and Answers (Q&As) to provide banks guidance pertaining to CRA-eligible activities; however, Treasury noted that each regulator provides its examiners with additional guidance. Also, the Interagency Q&As illustrate past CRA-qualifying activities, but Treasury noted that no formal process currently exists to help determine whether potential (complex, innovative, or innovative) activities would qualify for CRA credit. Treasury recommends establishing clearer standards for CRA-qualifying activities and flexibility (expanding the types of loans, investments, and services that qualify for CRA credit), which may encourage banks to venture beyond activities that typically receive CRA credit. Treasury reports that each bank regulator follows a different examination schedule; the examinations are lengthy; and delays associated with the release of performance evaluations may limit the time banks can react to recommendations before their next CRA examination. Treasury recommends increasing the timeliness of the CRA examination process. Treasury recommends incorporating performance incentives that might result in more efficient lending activities. For example, CRA-qualifying loans may receive credit in the year of origination, but equity investments may receive credit each year that the investment is held. Treasury recommends consistent treatment of loans and investments, which may encourage banks to make more long-term loans (rather than sequences of short-term loans for the sake of being awarded CRA credits at each CRA examination). On August, 28, 2018, the OCC released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to seek comments on ways to modernize the CRA framework. The ANPR solicited comments on the issues raised by Treasury among other things. The OCC's ANPR does not propose specific changes, but its content and the questions posed suggest that the OCC is exploring the possibility of adopting a quantitative metric-based approach to CRA performance evaluation, changing how assessment areas are defined, expanding CRA-qualifying activities, and reducing the complexity, ambiguity, and burden of the regulations on the bank industry. When the comment period closed on November 19, 2018, the OCC had received 1584 comments. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC did not join the OCC in releasing the ANPR. The Federal Reserve System, however, did host research symposiums around the country to gather comments pertaining to CRA reform. As reported by the Federal Reserve, some banking industry comments suggested, among other things, the need for consistency of the CRA examinations to facilitate CRA compliance. Yet some tailoring may still be necessary with respect to determining assessment areas that better reflect each bank's business models, particularly for models that use technology to deliver products and services. The regulators also heard from community and consumer groups. While expressing the need to retain focus on the historical context of the CRA, these groups highlighted the need to address issues pertaining to banking deserts in underserved communities. Community development investments (CDIs) that meet public welfare investment (PWI) requirements are those that promote the public welfare, primarily resulting in economic benefits for low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals. This appendix provides examples of CDI activities that would qualify for consideration under the CRA investment test. In many cases, covered banks are more likely to take advantage of these optional vehicles to obtain CRA credits if they perceive the underlying investment opportunities to have profit potential. Loan Participations Banks and credit unions often use participation (syndicated) loans to jointly provide credit. When a financial firm (e.g., bank, credit union) originates a loan for a customer, it may decide to structure loan participation arrangements with other institutions. The loan originator often retains a larger portion of the loan and sells smaller portions to other financial institutions willing to participate. Suppose a financial firm originates a business or mortgage loan in a LMI neighborhood. A bank may receive CRA investment credit consideration by purchasing a participation, thus becoming a joint lender to the LMI borrower. An advantage of loan participations is that the default risk is divided and shared among the participating banks (as opposed to one financial firm retaining all of the risk). CRA consideration is possible if the activity occurs within the designated assessment area. For all participating banks to receive credit, some overlap in their designated assessment areas must exist. An exception is made for participations made to benefit designated disaster areas, in which all participating banks would receive CRA consideration regardless of location. State and Local Government Bonds State and local governments issue municipal bonds, and the proceeds are used to fund public projects, community development activities, and other qualifying activities. The interest that nonbank municipal bondholders receive is exempt from federal income taxes to encourage investment in hospitals, schools, infrastructure, and community development projects that require state and local funding. Legislative actions during the 1980s eliminated the tax-exempt status of interest earned from holdings of municipal bonds for banks. Although banks no longer have a tax incentive to purchase municipal bonds, they still consider the profitability of holding these loans, as they do with all lending opportunities. Furthermore, banks receive CRA investment consideration when purchasing state and local municipal bonds that fund public and community development projects in their designated assessment areas. CRA-Targeted Secondary Market Instruments Secondary market financial products have been developed to facilitate the ability of banks to participate in lending activities eligible for CRA consideration, such as purchasing mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) or shares of real estate investment trusts (REITs). A MBS is a pool of mortgage loans secured by residential properties; a multifamily MBS is a pool of mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties, consisting of structures designed for five or more residential units, such as apartment buildings, hospitals, nursing homes, and manufactured homes. CRA-MBSs are MBSs consisting of loans that originated in specific geographic assessment areas, thereby allowing bank purchases into these pools to be eligible for CRA consideration under the investment test. Similarly, REITs may also pool mortgages, mortgage MBSs, and real estate investments (e.g., real property, apartments, office buildings, shopping malls, hotels). Investors purchase shares in REIT pools and defer the taxes. Banks may only invest in mortgage REITs and MBS REITs. Similar to the CRA-MBSs, the REITs must consist of mortgages and MBSs that would be eligible for CRA consideration. The Community Development Trust REIT is an example of a REIT that serves as a CRA-qualified investment for banks. Community Development Financial Institutions and Equity Equivalent Investments The Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund was created by the Riegle Community Development Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (the Riegle Act; P.L. 103-325 ). The CDFI Fund was established to promote economic development for distressed urban and rural communities. The CDFI Fund, currently located within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is authorized to certify banks, credit unions, nonprofit loan funds, and (for-profit and nonprofit) venture capital funds as designated CDFIs. In other words, a bank may satisfy the requirements to become a CDFI, but not all CDFIs are banks. The primary focus of institutions with CDFI certification is to serve the financial needs of economically distressed people and places. The designation also makes these institutions eligible to receive financial awards and other assistance from the CDFI Fund. In contrast to non-CDFI banks, some CDFI banks have greater difficulty borrowing funds and then transforming them into loans for riskier, economically distressed consumers. The lack of loan level data for most CDFI banks causes creditors to hesitate in making low-cost, short-term loans to these institutions. Specifically, the lack of information on loan defaults and prepayment rates on CDFI banking assets is likely to result in limited ability to sell these loan originations to secondary loan markets. Consequently, the retention of higher-risk loans, combined with limited access to low-cost, short-term funding, makes CDFI banks more vulnerable to liquidity shortages. Hence, CDFIs rely primarily on funding their loans (assets) with net assets , which are proceeds analogous to the equity of a traditional bank or net worth of a credit union. CDFI net assets are often acquired in the form of awards or grants from the CDFI Fund or for-profit banks. Funding assets with net assets is less expensive for CDFIs than funding with longer-term borrowings. Banks may obtain CRA investment credit consideration by making investments to CDFIs, which provides CDFIs with net assets (equity). Under PWI authority, banks are allowed to make equity investments in specialized financial institutions, such as CDFIs, as long as they are considered by their safety and soundness regulator to be at least adequately capitalized . Furthermore, the final Basel III notification of proposed regulation (NPR) allows for preferential capital treatment for equity investments made under PWI authority, meaning equity investments to designated CDFIs may receive more favorable capital treatment. Consequently, banks often provide funds to CDFIs through equity equivalent investments (EQ2s), which are debt instruments issued by CDFIs with a continuous rolling (indeterminate) maturity. EQ2s, from a bank's perspective, are analogous to holding convertible preferred stock with a regularly scheduled repayment. Hence, banks may view EQ2s as a potentially profitable opportunity to invest in other specialized financial institutions and receive CRA consideration, particularly when the funds are subsequently used by CDFIs to originate loans in the banks' assessment areas. Small Business Investment Companies The Small Business Administration (SBA) was established in 1953 by the Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163) to support small businesses' access to capital in a variety of ways. Although issuing loan guarantees for small businesses is a significant component of its operations, the SBA also has the authority to facilitate the equity financing of small business ventures through its Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, which was established by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-699). SBICs that are licensed and regulated by the SBA may provide debt and equity financing and, although not a program requirement, educational (management consulting) resources for businesses that meet certain SBA size requirements. Banks may act as limited partners if they choose to provide funds to SBICs, which act as general partners. Banks may establish their own SBICs, jointly establish SBICs (with other banks), or provide funds to existing SBICs. SBICs subsequently use bank funding to invest in the long-term debt and equity securities of small, independent (SBA-eligible) businesses, and banks may receive CRA investment consideration if the activities benefit their assessment areas. Community banks invest in SBICs because of the profit potential as well as the opportunity to establish long-term relationships with business clients during their infancy stages. Banks that are considered by their regulators to be adequately capitalized are allowed to invest in these specialized financial institutions under PWI authority, but the investments still receive risk-based capital treatment. SBIC assets, similar to CDFIs, are illiquid given the difficulty to obtain credit ratings for SBIC investments; thus, they cannot be sold in secondary markets. Because banks risk losing the principal of their equity investments, they are required to perform the proper due diligence associated with prudent underwriting. Tax Credits The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) program was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ) to encourage the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. Generally speaking, government (federal or state) issued tax credits may be bought and, in many cases, sold like any other financial asset (e.g., stocks and bonds). Owners of tax credits may reduce their tax liabilities either by the amount of the credits or by using the formulas specified on those credits, assuming the owners have participated in the specified activities that the government wants to encourage. For LIHTCs, banks may use a formula to reduce their federal tax liabilities when they provide either credit or equity contributions (grants) for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing. If a bank also owns a LIHTC, then a percentage of the equity grant may be tax deductible if the CDFI uses the funds from the grant to finance affordable rental housing. Furthermore, banks may receive consideration for CRA-qualified investment credits. After a domestic corporation or partnership receives designation as a Community Development Entity (CDE) from the CFDI Fund, it may apply for New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs). Encouraging capital investments in LMI communities is the primary mission of CDEs, and CDFIs and SBICs automatically qualify as CDEs. Only CDEs are eligible to compete for NMTCs, which are allocated by the CDFI Fund via a competitive process. Once awarded an allocation of NMTCs, the CDE must obtain equity investments in exchange for the credits. Then, the equity proceeds raised must either be used to provide loans or technical assistance or deployed in eligible community investment activities. Only for-profit CDEs, however, may provide NMTCs to their investors in exchange for equity investments. Investors making for-profit CDE equity investments can use the NMTCs to reduce their tax liabilities by a certain amount over a period of years. As previously discussed, a bank may receive CRA credit for making equity investments in nonprofit CDEs and for-profit subsidiaries, particularly if the investment occurs within the bank's assessment area. Furthermore, banks may be able to reduce their tax liabilities if they can obtain NMTCs from the CDEs in which their investments were made.", "answers": ["The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) addresses how banking institutions meet the credit needs of the areas they serve, particularly in low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The federal banking regulatory agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—currently implement the CRA. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur with a designated assessment area. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating. The CRA requires these ratings be taken into account when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions among other things. The CRA, which was enacted in 1977, was subsequently revised in 1989 to require public disclosure of bank CRA ratings to establish a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (i.e., Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). In 1995, the CRA examination was customized to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised and indexed to the Consumer Price Index. The 2005 amendments also expanded opportunities for banks to earn CRA credit for public welfare investments (such as providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals). Qualifying activities under the CRA have evolved to include consumer and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. Congressional interest in the CRA stems from various perceptions of its effectiveness. Some have argued that, by encouraging lending in LMI neighborhoods, the CRA may also encourage the issuance of higher-risk loans to borrowers likely to have repayment problems (under the presumption that low-income is correlated with lower creditworthiness), which can translate into losses for lenders. Others are concerned that the CRA is not generating sufficient incentives to increase credit availability to qualified LMI borrowers, which may impede economic recovery for some, particularly following the 2007-2009 recession. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI borrowers. After a discussion of the CRA's origins, it presents the CRA's examination process and bank activities that are eligible for consideration of CRA credits. Next, it discusses the difficulty of determining the CRA's influence on bank behavior. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that compliance with the CRA does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. In the absence of benchmarks, determining the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors is not straightforward. Banks also face a variety of financial incentives—for example, capital requirements, the prevailing interest rate environment, changes in tax laws, and technological innovations—that influence how much (or how little) they lend to LMI borrowers. Because multiple financial profit incentives and CRA incentives tend to exist simultaneously, it is difficult to determine the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors."], "length": 7628, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1231ee78575d7c89cedcde393289ddeada21418687316722"}
{"input": "", "context": "Medicare pays for laboratory tests that are performed individually or in a group. For individual tests, laboratories submit claims to Medicare for each test they perform that is on the CLFS; tests are identified using a billing code. Prior to the implementation of PAMA in 2018, the payment rates on the CLFS were based on rates charged for laboratory tests in 1984 through 1985 adjusted for inflation. Additionally, 57 geographic jurisdictions had their own fee schedules for laboratory tests. CMS used the 57 separate fee schedules to calculate a national limitation amount, which served as the maximum payment for individual laboratory tests. Thus, the payment rate for an individual test was the lesser of the amount claimed by the laboratory, the local fee for a geographic area, or the national limitation amount for a particular test. Medicare pays bundled payment rates for certain laboratory tests that are performed as a group, called panel tests. Panel tests can be divided into two categories—those without billing codes and those with billing codes. Panel tests without billing codes are composed of at least 2 of 23 distinct component tests. Additionally, there are 7 specific combinations of these 23 component tests that are commonly used and have their own billing code. Prior to 2018, Medicare paid for both types of panel tests (those without or with a billing code) using a bundled rate based on the number of tests performed, with modest payment increases for each additional test conducted. For example, in 2017, Medicare paid $7.15 for panel tests with two component tests and $9.12 for panel tests with 3 component tests, with a maximum bundled payment rate of $16.64 for all 23 component tests. Prior to 2018, the Medicare Administrative Contractors would count the number of tests performed before determining the appropriate bundled payment rate. For those panel tests with a billing code, the payment rate was the same if laboratories used the associated billing code for the panel test or listed each of the component tests separately. After PAMA’s implementation in 2018, the 57 separate fee schedules for individual laboratory tests were replaced with a single national fee schedule. The payment rates for this single national fee schedule were based on private-payer rates for laboratory tests paid from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. Specifically, the payment rate for an individual test was generally based on the median private-payer rates for a given test, weighted by test volume. Payment for panel tests also changed in 2018. For panel tests without billing codes, Medicare Administrative Contractors no longer counted the number of component tests performed to determine the bundled payment rate; instead, Medicare paid the separate rate for each component test in the panel. For panel tests with a billing code, the payment rate depended on how the laboratory submitted the claim. If a laboratory used the billing code associated with the panel test, Medicare paid the bundled payment rate for that billing code. If a laboratory submitted a claim for the panel test, but listed each of the component tests separately instead of using the panel test’s billing code, Medicare paid the individual payment rate for each component test. Table 1 below summarizes the changes to payment rates before and after 2018. Multiple types of laboratories receive payment under Medicare. The three laboratory types that received the most revenue from the CLFS in 2016 were independent laboratories, hospital-outreach laboratories, and physician-office laboratories. (See table 2.) Estimates of the size of the total U.S. laboratory market vary. For example, the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership estimated that the laboratory industry received $87 billion in revenue in 2017, while another market report estimated the laboratory industry received $75 billion in revenue in 2016. Similar to Medicare, the three laboratory types that generally receive the most revenue overall are independent laboratories, hospital-outreach laboratories, and physician-office laboratories, when laboratory tests performed in hospital inpatient and outpatient settings were excluded. Estimates of revenue received by these laboratories also vary. For example, in recent years, estimates of the share of laboratory industry revenue generated by independent laboratories ranged from 37 percent to 54 percent. Additionally, estimates of revenue generated by hospital- outreach laboratories recently ranged from 21 to 35 percent, and physician-office laboratories ranged from 4 to 11 percent of total laboratory industry revenue. Private-payer rates for laboratory tests conducted by the three largest laboratory types generally vary by type and other characteristics, according to market reports and the laboratory industry officials we interviewed. Independent laboratories. These laboratories generally receive lower private-payer rates than other types of laboratories, according to industry officials we interviewed. Market reports we reviewed noted that about half of the independent laboratory market is dominated by two national laboratories and that these national laboratories provide more competitive pricing by performing a large volume of tests at one time. Medicare accounted for a smaller proportion of the revenue earned by these two national laboratories (12 percent), compared to other laboratories, according to another market report we reviewed. In contrast, a different market report noted that smaller, independent laboratories tend to earn more of their revenue from Medicare (34 percent). Hospital-outreach laboratories. These hospital-affiliated laboratories typically receive relatively higher private-payer rates, according to industry officials we interviewed. Although hospital- outreach laboratories perform tests similar to other laboratories, they can obtain above-average payment rates by leveraging the market power of their affiliated hospital when negotiating rates with private payers, according to industry officials and market reports. Hospital-outreach laboratories generally receive about 25 to 30 percent of their revenue from the Medicare CLFS. Physician-office laboratories. Physician-office laboratories typically receive higher private-payer rates than independent laboratories, according to a recent analysis by a laboratory industry association. This industry association also noted that the cost structure to operate in a setting such as a physician-office laboratory is different than in large independent laboratories, as the physician-office laboratory is unable to conduct a large number of tests at one time. Officials from another industry association we interviewed said that payment rates for these laboratories are generally dependent on the size of the physician practice group. These same officials told us that larger physician groups (e.g., 10 or more physicians) typically negotiate higher rates from private payers than smaller physician groups. Most physician-office laboratories received less than $25,000 in revenue per year from Medicare, according to CMS. Additionally, in 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that Medicare’s payment rates on the CLFS were higher than rates paid by some private health insurance plans. Specifically, it found that Medicare rates for laboratory tests were 18 percent to 30 percent higher than rates paid by certain insurers under health benefits plans for federal employees. Definition of Applicable Laboratories Required to Report Private-Payer Data to CMS CMS defined applicable laboratories as those meeting four criteria: (1) they met the definition of laboratory under regulations implementing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988; (2) they billed Medicare Part B under their own Medicare billing number, also called the national provider identifier; (3) more than 50 percent of their total Medicare revenues came from the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) and/or the Physician Fee Schedule; and (4) they received at least $12,500 in Medicare revenue from the CLFS from January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016. CMS analyzed private-payer data it collected from about 2,000 laboratories to develop new payment rates for individual laboratory tests on the CLFS. PAMA defined laboratories required to report private-payer data, called applicable laboratories, as laboratories that meet certain criteria. (See sidebar.) Applicable laboratories with their own specific billing number, the NPI, submitted these data to CMS. If one organization operated multiple applicable laboratories, each with its own NPI, then the organization could report data to CMS for multiple applicable laboratories. CMS collected data from applicable laboratories on payments they received from private payers during the first half of 2016. Specifically, CMS collected data on (1) the unique billing code associated with a laboratory test; (2) the private-payer rate for each laboratory test for which final payment was made during the data collection period (January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016); and (3) the volume of tests performed for each unique billing code at that private- payer rate. For the data CMS collected between January 1, 2017, and May 30, 2017, CMS relied on the entities reporting to CMS to attest to the completeness and accuracy of the data they submitted. CMS relied on each laboratory to identify whether or not it was an applicable laboratory and took steps to assist laboratories in meeting reporting requirements. According to CMS officials, they relied on laboratories to self-identify as applicable laboratories because they were unable to accurately identify the number of laboratories required to report. To assist laboratories, CMS issued multiple guidance documents to the industry outlining the criteria for being an applicable laboratory and describing the type of data CMS intended to collect. CMS also conducted educational calls when the proposed and final rules were issued and prior to the data collection period. CMS officials told us they conducted additional outreach activities, including holding conference calls with national laboratory associations and attending professional conferences. Officials said they used these outreach activities in addition to the guidance issued to inform laboratories of the reporting requirements for applicable laboratories, for example. In addition, CMS established a revenue threshold of $12,500 in an effort to reduce the reporting burden for entities that receive a relatively small amount of revenues under the CLFS. In its final rule, CMS noted that it expected that many of the laboratories that would be below this revenue threshold and, thus exempt from reporting data to CMS, would be physician-office laboratories. CMS also chose to use the NPI in its definition of applicable laboratory in the final rule to allow hospital- outreach laboratories that use their own NPI to submit data to the agency. In its proposed rule, CMS suggested using an alternative identification number to the NPI. However, according to the final rule, CMS chose to use the NPI in its definition of applicable laboratory to allow those hospital-outreach laboratories billing using their own NPI to submit private-payer data to the agency. According to CMS, at the end of the 5-month submission period, the agency had received data from approximately 2,000 applicable laboratories, representing a volume of almost 248 million laboratory tests; these data accounted for about $31 billion in revenue from private payers. CMS reported that the data it collected included private-payer rates for 96 percent of the 1,347 eligible billing codes on the CLFS. CMS used these data to calculate a median, private-payer rate, weighted by volume and phased in this change by limiting payment-rate reductions to 10 percent per year. Beginning in 2018, these new payment rates served as the single, national payment rate for individual laboratory tests. These payment rates were also used for the individual, component tests that make up panel tests and were used when laboratories billed Medicare for panel tests by listing the component tests separately. In general, the median payments rates, weighted for volume, that CMS calculated were lower than Medicare’s previous payment rates for most laboratory tests. According to our analysis, these median payment rates were lower than the corresponding 2017 CLFS national limitation amounts (the maximum that CMS would pay for laboratory tests) for approximately 88 percent of tests. Figure 1 below describes the percentage difference between these median payment rates and Medicare’s 2017 national limitation amounts for laboratory tests. The final payment rates that CMS calculated, which included the 10- percent, phased in, payment-rate reductions, will remain in effect until December 31, 2020; PAMA requires CMS to calculate new payment rates for the CLFS every 3 years. Reporting entities will next be required to submit data on private-payer rates to CMS in early 2020, for final payments made from January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019. PAMA capped any reductions for the second 3-year cycle after implementation to a maximum of 15 percent per year. CMS did not collect private-payer data from all laboratories required to report this information and did not estimate how much data was not reported by these laboratories, according to agency officials. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements and submit data accordingly. CMS emphasized the importance of receiving data from all laboratories required to report by stating that it is critical that CMS collect complete data on private-payer rates in order to set accurate Medicare rates. However, agency officials told us that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. They also told us that CMS did not have the information available to estimate how much data was missing because not all laboratories reported or the extent to which the data collected were representative of all of the data that laboratories were required to report. Prior to collecting private-payer data, CMS estimated that laboratories subject to reporting requirements would receive more than 90 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office laboratories and independent laboratories. Specifically, based on its analysis of 2013 Medicare expenditures, CMS estimated that reporting requirements would apply to the laboratories that received 92 percent of CLFS payments to physician- office laboratories and 99 percent of CLFS payments to independent laboratories. After laboratories reported private-payer data, we analyzed the share of CLFS expenditures received by the laboratories that reported. Our analysis found that CMS collected data from laboratories that received the majority of CLFS payments to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories in 2016. However, the laboratories that reported private-payer data received less than 70 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories. Specifically, using Medicare claims data, we calculated that CMS collected data from laboratories that received 68 percent of 2016 CLFS payments to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories. Although it did not collect complete data, CMS concluded that it collected sufficient private-payer data to set Medicare payment rates and that collecting more data from additional laboratories that were required to report would not significantly affect Medicare expenditures. This conclusion was based, in part, on a sensitivity analyses that CMS conducted of the effects that collecting certain types and amounts of additional data would have on weighted median private-payer rates and the effects those rates could have on Medicare payment rates and, thus, expenditures. Results from these analyses showed that Medicare expenditures based on the CLFS would have changed by 2 percent or less after collecting more data from the various types of laboratories. For example, CMS estimated that doubling the amount of private-payer data from physician-office laboratories would increase expenditures by 2 percent and collecting ten times as much data from hospital outreach laboratories would increase expenditures by 1 percent. (See fig. 2.) PAMA’s 10-percent limit on annual payment-rate reductions likely reduced the effect that incomplete private-payer data could have on the CLFS because this limit applied to most Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests. As demonstrated in figure 1, while 59 percent of tests had median private-payer rates that were at least 30 percent less than their respective 2017 national limitation amounts, CMS published Medicare rates for these tests for 2018 through 2020 that were reduced by only 10 percent per year as a result of this limit. For example, a hypothetical laboratory test with a 2017 CLFS national limitation amount of $10.00 and a median private-payer rate of $7.00 would result in CLFS rates of $9.00 in 2018, $8.10 in 2019, and $7.29 in 2020. Changes to median private-payer rates due to collecting more complete data or eliminating inaccurate data would have no effect on Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020 for this hypothetical test if they resulted in new median rates of $7.29 or less. Our analysis of the potential effects that collecting data from additional laboratories could have had on Medicare payment rates and expenditures found that the effect of CMS not collecting complete data would likely have been greater absent PAMA’s limits on annual reductions to Medicare payment rates. As a result, CMS may face challenges setting accurate Medicare rates if it does not collect complete data from all laboratories required to report in the future when PAMA allows for greater annual payment-rate reductions. To conduct this analysis, we used the private-payer data CMS collected to analyze the range of effects that collecting additional data could have on Medicare expenditures, assuming 2016 utilization rates remain constant. The extent of these effects depends on the amount of additional data CMS would need to collect to obtain complete data and whether the payment rates in these additional data would have been greater or less than the medians of the rates reported. For example, we estimated that if CMS needed to collect 20 percent more data for its collection to be complete, doing so could increase Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by as much as 3 percent or reduce them by as much as 3 percent depending on the payment rates in these additional data. However, if annual limits to Medicare payment-rate reductions were not applied, collecting these additional data could increase CLFS expenditures by as much as 9 percent or reduce them by as much as 9 percent. (See fig. 3 and app. II for additional information about these estimates.) As demonstrated in figure 2, CMS did analyze how collecting certain types and amounts of data from additional laboratories would affect Medicare expenditures. However, without valid estimates of how much more data these additional laboratories were required to report and how much these data would change median payment rates, it remains unknown whether CMS’s analyses estimate the actual risk of setting Medicare payment rates that do not reflect private-payer rates from all applicable laboratories, as mandated by PAMA. CMS could have compared the data it collected with independent information on the payment rates laboratories were required to report, for example. The independent information could be estimated by auditing a random sample of laboratories or could be estimated using data from third-party vendors, if these vendors could supply relevant and reliable information. We found that CMS mitigated challenges to setting accurate Medicare payment rates by identifying, analyzing, and responding to potentially inaccurate private-payer data. CMS addressed potentially inaccurate private-payer data and other data that CMS determined did not meet reporting requirements. CMS removed or replaced data from four reporting entities that appeared to have or confirmed having reported revenue—which is the payment rate multiplied by the volume of tests paid at that rate—instead of payment rates. We estimated that if CMS had included these data that CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 would have increased by 7 percent. CMS removed data it determined were reported in error including duplicate submissions and submissions with payment rates of $0.00. We estimated that removing these data will change CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by less than one percent. CMS identified four other types of potentially inaccurate data that it determined would not significantly impact Medicare payment rates or expenditures and did not exclude them from calculations of median private-payer rates. CMS considered the following potentially inaccurate data to have met its reporting requirements: 1. data from 57 entities that reported particularly high rates in at least 60 percent of their data, 2. data from 12 entities that reported particularly low rates in at least 50 percent of their data, 3. data with payment rates that were 10 times greater than the 2017 national limitation amounts or 10 times less than these amounts, and 4. data from laboratories that may not have met the $12,500 low- expenditure threshold or that reported data from a hospital NPI instead of a laboratory NPI. We found that each of these four types of potentially inaccurate data would have changed estimated Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by 1 percent or less if CMS had instead excluded the data. To conduct this analysis, we recalculated Medicare rates after excluding each type of data and estimated Medicare expenditures assuming 2016 rates of utilization. Although weighted median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare’s 2017 national limitation amounts for 88 percent of tests, we estimated the total Medicare expenditures based on the 2018 CLFS would likely increase by 3 percent ($225 million overall) compared to 2016 expenditures, assuming test utilization remained at 2016 levels. This increase in estimated expenditures is due, in part, to CMS’s use of above-average payment rates as a baseline to calculate payment rates for those laboratory tests affected by PAMA’s annual payment-rate reduction limit of 10 percent. (See fig. 4.) When applying the 10-percent payment-rate reduction limit, CMS used as its starting point the 2017 national limitation amounts in order to set a single, national payment rate for each laboratory test. Thus, the Medicare payment rate for a test in 2018 could not be less than 90 percent of the test’s 2017 national limitation amount. However, prior to 2018, some payment rates were commonly lower than the national limitation amounts because they were based on the lesser of (1) the amount billed on claims, (2) the local fee for a geographic area, or (3) a national limitation amount, and because panel tests had different bundled payment rates. As a result, by reducing payment rates from national limitation amounts, CMS did not always reduce rates from what Medicare actually paid. Panel tests, in particular, frequently received bundled payment rates that differed substantially from national limitation amounts associated with their billing codes prior to 2018. We compared national limitation amounts, which represent maximum Medicare payment rates for tests, with the average amounts Medicare allowed for payment in 2016, which reflect actual Medicare payment rates. For example, figure 5 below shows that the 2017 national limitation amount for comprehensive metabolic panel tests ($14.49) was substantially higher than both the average amount Medicare allowed for payment in 2016 ($11.45) and the median payment rate laboratories reported receiving from private payers ($9.08). As a result, using the 2017 national limitation amount as a basis for payment reductions caused Medicare’s payment rate to increase from an average allowed amount of $11.45 in 2016, to a payment rate of $13.04 in 2018, instead of decreasing towards a lower median private- payer rate of $9.08. By increasing average payment rates rather than phasing in reductions to rates, CMS’s implementation may lead to paying more than necessary for some tests. Federal standards for internal control for information and communications require agency management to use quality information to achieve its objectives. Basing reductions on national limitation amounts rather than more relevant information on how much Medicare actually paid—such as the average allowable amounts in 2016, for example—could result in Medicare paying more than necessary by $733 million from 2018 through 2020, according to our estimates. In implementing PAMA, CMS eliminated bundled rates for panel tests that lack billing codes and started paying separately for each component test instead. CMS also implemented the 2018 CLFS in a manner that could lead to unbundling payment rates for panel tests with billing codes. If payment rates for all panel tests were unbundled, we estimated that Medicare expenditures could increase by $218 million for panel tests that lack billing codes and by as much as $10.1 billion for panel tests with billing codes from 2018 through 2020. CMS also estimated that there could be significant risks of paying more than necessary associated with unbundling and has taken initial steps to monitor these risks and explore possible responses, but had not yet responded to these risks as of July 2018. CMS Unbundled Payment Rates for Panel Tests without Billing Codes Beginning in 2018, CMS no longer uses bundled payment rates for panel tests without billing codes and instead pays laboratories individual payments for each component test that comprises these panel tests. However, CMS staff and members of its advisory panel discussed concerns with this approach. At an advisory panel meeting in 2016, CMS staff relayed concerns from stakeholders that CMS would not be able to collect valid data on private-payer rates for these panel tests. According to agency staff, stakeholders had informed CMS that private payers commonly use bundled payment rates for these panel tests, but laboratories would only be able to report unbundled payment rates for individual component tests. We estimated that unbundling these payment rates would increase Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by $218 million in comparison to the estimated Medicare expenditures over the same time period based on Medicare’s 2016 utilization and allowable amounts. For example, under the 2016 CLFS, Medicare paid approximately 435,000 claims for panel tests that included the laboratory tests assay of creatinine (HCPCS code 82565) and assay of urea nitrogen (HCPCS code 84520) at an average bundled payment rate of $6.82. In contrast, under the 2018 CLFS, these two component tests are reimbursed individually at $6.33 and $4.88, respectively, or $11.21 combined—a 63 percent increase. Despite concerns about the validity of available private-payer data on component tests for panel tests without billing codes, CMS used these data to set payment rates for component tests. CMS officials told us that they stopped using bundled payment rates for these panel tests because it is not clear that CMS has the authority to combine the individual component tests into groups for bundled payment as it did before 2018 due to PAMA’s reference to payments for each test. However, in July 2018, CMS officials told us the agency was reviewing its authority regarding this issue. CMS officials told us they are exploring alternative approaches that could limit increases to Medicare expenditures but had not yet determined what additional legal authority would be needed, if any, and did not know when CMS would make this determination. Agency officials told us that CMS has taken initial steps to monitor unbundling and explore possible responses, including the following: Monitoring unbundling: CMS has begun monitoring changes in panel test utilization, payment rates, and expenditures associated with its implementation of PAMA, according to officials. For example, CMS officials told us that preliminary data indicated that Medicare payments for individual component tests of panel tests has increased substantially in 2018, but, as of July 2018, it was too early to draw conclusions from these data because laboratories have up to one year to submit claims for tests. Collecting input on alternatives: In 2016, a subcommittee of an advisory panel that CMS established reviewed Medicare’s use of bundled payment rates for panel tests and published different approaches for CMS to consider implementing in combination with other changes to implement PAMA. CMS’s Implementation of PAMA May Have Allowed Unbundling of Payment Rates for Panel Tests with Billing Codes Beginning in 2018, laboratories that submit claims for any of the seven panel tests with billing codes by using the billing codes for the individual component tests now receive the payment rate for each component test, rather than the bundled rate. Prior to 2018, laboratories could submit claims for these panel tests either by using the specific codes for panel tests or by billing separately for each of the component tests, and, regardless of how laboratories submitted claims, Medicare Administrative Contractors would pay bundled payment rates based on how many of the 23 component tests were conducted. However, CMS instructed Medicare Administrative Contractors to stop bundling payment rates for tests that are billed individually on claims rather than billed on claims using codes for panel tests, beginning in 2018. CMS did so because it was not clear that CMS had the authority to combine the individual component tests into groups for bundled payment as it did before 2018 due to PAMA’s reference to payments for individual tests, according to agency officials. This change could potentially have a large effect on Medicare spending. For example, if a laboratory submitted a claim individually for the 14 component tests that comprise a comprehensive metabolic panel it would receive a payment of $81.91, a 528 percent increase from the 2018 Medicare bundled payment rate of $13.04 for this panel test. (See fig. 6.) Improving how reductions to payment rates for panel tests are phased in could mitigate, but not completely counteract, the effect of unbundling these payment rates. For example, for the comprehensive metabolic panel test described in figure 6, basing maximum reductions on 2016 average allowable amounts would result in a 2018 Medicare bundled payment rate of $10.31 instead of $13.04 and individual payment rates for the 14 component tests that total $56.06—a 32 percent decrease from $81.91 that Medicare would otherwise pay. If the payment rate for each panel test with a billing code were unbundled, we estimated that Medicare expenditures for these tests from 2018 through 2020 could reach $13.5 billion, a $10.1 billion increase from the $3.3 billion we estimated Medicare would spend using the bundled payment rates in the CLFS. Similarly, prior to implementing PAMA, CMS estimated that Medicare expenditures to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories could potentially increase as much as $2.5 billion in 2018, alone if it paid for the same number of panel tests with billing codes as it did in 2016 but paid for each component test individually. These estimates represent an upper limit on the increased expenditures that could occur if every laboratory stopped using panel test billing codes and instead used the billing codes for individual component tests. We do not know the extent to which laboratories will stop filing claims using panel test billing codes. CMS officials also told us that they were aware of the risks associated with paying for the individual component tests instead of the bundled payment rate for a panel test with a billing code. However, CMS guidance, which was effective in 2018, continued to allow laboratories to use the billing codes for individual component tests rather than the billing code for the panel. CMS officials explained that this was due to PAMA’s reference to payments for individual tests, similar to CMS’s decision to stop paying bundled rates for panel tests without billing codes. At the time we did our work, CMS had not implemented a response to these risks but had taken some initial steps to monitor unbundling and consider alternative approaches to Medicare payment rates for these tests. HHS provided additional information on planned activities to address these risks in its written comments on a draft of this report. (See app. III.) CMS collected data on private-payer rates from laboratories that were required to report these data, but not all laboratories complied with the reporting requirement, and the extent of noncompliance remains unclear. PAMA’s provision directing CMS to phase in payment-rate reductions to Medicare payment rates likely moderates the potential adverse effects of incomplete private-payer data. However, in the future, failing to collect complete data could substantially affect Medicare payment rates because private-payer rates alone will determine Medicare payment rates. In addition, we estimated that Medicare expenditures on laboratory tests will be $733 million higher from 2018 through 2020, because CMS started phasing in payment-rate reductions from national limitation amounts instead of more relevant data on actual payment rates, such as average allowable amounts. Finally, changes to payment rates, billing practices, and testing practices could increase Medicare expenditures by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020, if CMS does not address the risks associated with unbundling payment rates for panel tests. Agency officials indicated that it was unclear if PAMA limited CMS’s ability to combine individual component tests into groups for bundled payment, and, as of July 2018, CMS was reviewing this matter but did not know when it would make a determination. We are making the following three recommendations to CMS: The Administrator of CMS should take steps to collect all of the data from all laboratories that are required to report. If only partial data can be collected, CMS should estimate how incomplete data would affect Medicare payment rates and address any significant challenges to setting accurate Medicare rates. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of CMS should phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018 rather than the national limitation amounts. CMS should revise these rates as soon as practicable to prevent paying more than necessary. (Recommendation 2) The Administrator of CMS should use bundled rates for panel tests, consistent with its practice prior to 2018, rather than paying for them individually; if necessary, the Administrator of CMS should seek legislative authority to do so. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHs provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix III. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. HHS concurred with our first recommendation to take steps to collect all data from laboratories required to report and commented that it is evaluating ways to increase reporting. In particular, in a November 2018 final rule, HHS changed the definition of an applicable laboratory, which it expects will increase the number of laboratories required to report data on private-payer rates to the agency. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed with our second recommendation to phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018. HHS noted that any changes to the phasing in of payment-rate reductions would need to be implemented through rulemaking. We estimated that by using the national limitation amounts as a starting point for these reductions, Medicare expenditures would increase by $733 million from 2018 through 2020. For this reason, we continue to believe CMS should revise these rates as soon as practicable and through whatever mechanism CMS determines appropriate. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed with our third recommendation to use bundled rates for panel tests. However, HHS commented that it is taking steps to address this issue. More specifically, for panel tests with billing codes, HHS is working to implement an automated process to identify claims for panel tests that should receive bundled payments, similar to the process used to bundle payment rates for these panel tests prior to PAMA’s implementation and anticipates implementing this change by the summer of 2019. In addition, HHS posted guidance on November 14, 2018, stating that the panel tests with billing codes, laboratories should submit claims using the corresponding code rather than the codes for the separate component tests beginning in 2019. To reduce the potential of paying more than necessary, we believe it is important that CMS implement its proposed automated process to allow for these payments as soon as possible. In contrast, for panel tests without billing codes, HHS commented that it is continuing to review its authority and considering other approaches to payment for these panel tests, such as adding codes to the CLFS. We estimate that unbundling the payment for these panel tests could increase Medicare expenditures by $218 million from 2018 through 2020 compared to expenditures based on Medicare’s 2016 utilization, and the actual amount could be higher if utilization increases. For this reason, we believe CMS should implement bundled payment rates for these panel tests to avoid excess payments.

Table 4 below demonstrates the challenges the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) faces in setting accurate Medicare payment rates to the extent it does not collect complete data from laboratories on private-payer rates. Specifically, the table shows the potential effect that collecting additional data for each laboratory test could have on Medicare expenditures and how this effect could vary depending on (1) the amount of additional data collected, (2) payment rates in the additional data, and (3) limits to annual reductions in Medicare payment rates. These limits are in place from 2018 through 2023 to phase in changes to payment rates. In addition to the contact named above, Martin T.

These tests help health care providers prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. PAMA included a provision for GAO to review CMS's implementation of new payment rates for these tests. This report addresses, among other objectives, (1) how CMS developed the new payment rates; (2) challenges CMS faced in setting accurate payment rates and what factors may have mitigated these challenges; and (3) the potential effect of the new payment rates on Medicare expenditures. GAO analyzed 2016 Medicare claims data (the most recent data available when GAO started its work and the year on which new payment rates were based) and private-payer data CMS collected. GAO also interviewed CMS and industry officials. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revised the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for 2018, establishing new Medicare payment rates for laboratory services. Prior to 2018, these rates were based on historical laboratory fees and were typically higher than the rates paid by private payers. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) required CMS to develop a national fee schedule for laboratory tests based on private-payer data. To revise the rates, CMS collected data on private-payer rates from approximately 2,000 laboratories and calculated median payment rates, weighted by volume. GAO found that the median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare's maximum payment rates in 2017 for 88 percent of tests. CMS is gradually phasing in reductions to Medicare payment rates, limited annually at 10 percent over a 3-year period (2018 through 2020), as outlined in PAMA. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements, but agency officials told GAO that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. CMS did not estimate the amount of data it should have received from laboratories that were required to report but did not. CMS took steps to exclude inaccurate private-payer data and estimated how collecting certain types and amounts of additional private-payer data could affect Medicare expenditures. However, it is not known whether CMS's estimates reflect the actual risk of incomplete data resulting in inaccurate Medicare payment rates. GAO found that PAMA's phased in reductions to new Medicare payment rates likely mitigated this risk of inaccurate Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020. However, GAO found that collecting incomplete data could have a larger effect on the accuracy of Medicare payment rates in future years when PAMA allows for greater payment-rate reductions. CMS's implementation of the new payment rates could lead Medicare to pay billions of dollars more than is necessary and result in CLFS expenditures increasing from what Medicare paid prior to 2018 for two reasons. First, CMS used the maximum Medicare payment rates in 2017 as a baseline to start the phase in of payment-rate reductions instead of using actual Medicare payment rates. This resulted in excess payments for some laboratory tests and, in some cases, higher payment rates than those Medicare previously paid, on average. GAO estimated that Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 may be $733 million more than if CMS had phased in payment-rate reductions based on the average payment rates in 2016. Second, CMS stopped paying a bundled payment rate for certain panel tests (groups of laboratory tests generally performed together), as was its practice prior to 2018, because CMS had not yet clarified its authority to do so under PAMA, according to officials. CMS is currently reviewing whether it has the authority to bundle payment rates for panel tests to reflect the efficiency of conducting a group of tests. GAO estimated that if the payment rate for each panel test were unbundled, Medicare expenditures could increase by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020 compared to estimated Medicare expenditures using lower bundled payment rates for panel tests. GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS (1) collect complete private-payer data from all laboratories required to report or address the estimated effects of incomplete data, (2) phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates rather than the maximum payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and (3) use bundled rates for panel tests. HHS concurred with GAO's first recommendation, neither agreed nor disagreed with the other two, and has since issued guidance to help address the third. GAO believes CMS should fully address these recommendations to prevent Medicare from paying more than is necessary."], "length": 7063, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "853f2aeea6f082063fb56b19aed190649d4c860388489296"}
{"input": "", "context": "HHS-OIG has the authority to exclude providers and other entities that have committed certain acts from participation in federal health care programs. According to HHS-OIG guidance, exclusion is a remedial measure designed to protect federal health care programs from any entity whose participation constitutes a risk to the programs or to program beneficiaries. Federal health care programs will not pay for any items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by excluded entities. Exclusions are mandatory under certain circumstances and permissive in others. In particular, mandatory exclusion applies to offenses that result in convictions relating to patient abuse or neglect and other crimes related to federal health care programs. When these offenses occur, but there is no criminal conviction, HHS-OIG may exercise its permissive exclusion authority. In certain circumstances where HHS-OIG can exercise its permissive exclusion authority, it evaluates each situation and decides what action to take based on its assessment of the future risk the entity poses to federal health care programs. Actions that HHS-OIG can consider taking include the following: Exclusion. HHS-OIG will exclude the highest-risk entities from participation in federal health care programs. Require the entity to enter into an agreement. HHS-OIG can require an entity to enter into a CIA or IA in exchange for a release of HHS-OIG’s exclusion authority. According to HHS-OIG guidance, the goals of these agreements are to strengthen an entity’s compliance program and promote compliance so that any issues in the future can be prevented or identified, reported and corrected. Heightened scrutiny. According to HHS-OIG officials, heightened scrutiny is reserved for situations in which the agency determined that an agreement was warranted but the entity was uncooperative. In such situations, HHS-OIG considers what other unilateral monitoring steps it can take to impose greater scrutiny. For example, according to HHS-OIG guidance, the agency has audited, evaluated, or investigated entities after fraud settlements when the entity would not enter into an agreement with HHS-OIG and it has made referrals to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for claims reviews. Reserve exclusion authority. For certain entities, HHS-OIG may reserve its exclusion authority and take “no further action,” meaning that HHS-OIG will not exclude the entity at that time and will not require the entity to enter into an agreement. Release of exclusion authority. In certain circumstances, HHS-OIG will release its exclusion authority without imposing additional requirements. Specifically, HHS-OIG may do this in situations in which the entity has self-disclosed the fraudulent conduct to HHS-OIG or has agreed to integrity obligations with a state or the DOJ that HHS- OIG has determined are sufficient. In situations in which HHS-OIG is evaluating whether to exercise its permissive exclusion authority, DOJ is often separately negotiating a settlement of the civil and/or criminal case against the entity on behalf of the federal government. Typically, such settlements resolve allegations that the entity is liable under the False Claims Act for submitting false claims to federal health care programs. According to both HHS-OIG and DOJ officials, if there is a related DOJ civil or criminal case and HHS-OIG officials are also negotiating an agreement with the entity in lieu of exclusion, the DOJ and HHS-OIG negotiations often occur at the same time or “on a parallel track.” However, according to these officials, while HHS-OIG and DOJ officials share information as needed, each engage in separate negotiations with the entity. According to HHS-OIG officials, there are also situations in which HHS-OIG enters into an agreement when there is not a related DOJ legal settlement. The Office of Counsel to the Inspector General within HHS-OIG is responsible for negotiating agreements and for monitoring them once they take effect. All agreements include provisions that identify the enforcement actions HHS-OIG can take when it finds that an entity has not complied with the terms of its agreement. These enforcement provisions outline the monetary penalties, referred to in the agreements as stipulated penalties, which HHS-OIG will demand if it identifies that the entity has failed to comply with certain agreement terms. The enforcement provisions also outline what constitutes a material breach of the agreement and indicate that exclusion can result if the entity is found to have materially breached its agreement. Examples of a material breach of the agreement include repeated violations of any of the agreement’s obligations and the failure to respond to a demand letter from HHS-OIG concerning the payment of stipulated penalties. From July 2005 through July 2017, HHS-OIG entered into 652 new agreements—an average of about 50 agreements per year—ranging from a high of 83 to a low of 37. The agreements were almost exclusively CIAs, which apply to larger corporations, and IAs, which apply to individual practitioners and entities such as small physician groups. HHS- OIG has used CIAs and IAs exclusively since 2010. From 2010 to July 2017, 74 percent of agreements have been CIAs and 26 percent of agreements have been IAs. See figure 1 for more information on the number and types of agreements since July 2005. HHS-OIG officials said that the agency transitioned away from other agreement types because of certain limitations that made them less useful than CIAs and IAs. For example, one historical agreement type— Certification of Compliance Agreements—did not provide sufficient opportunities for oversight, yet it required significant resources to create, officials said. Another discontinued agreement type—Settlement Agreement with Integrity Provisions—was negotiated as part of the DOJ settlement, such that HHS-OIG needed to work through DOJ if there was a need to take action for noncompliance. Although HHS-OIG and DOJ negotiate their agreements and settlements separately now, the majority of CIAs and IAs, are still associated with a DOJ legal settlement. Of the 652 agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, 619 were paired with a DOJ settlement, while 33 were the result of HHS-OIG independently exercising its exclusion authority. The total number of agreements in effect each year for the period we reviewed, which includes new agreements and ongoing agreements from past years, has decreased. Between 2006 and 2016 (the earliest and latest full years included in HHS-OIG’s database), the number of agreements in effect for any part of the calendar year decreased by 44 percent (see fig. 2). According to HHS-OIG officials, this is because, over time, the agency has increasingly focused its resources on entities that present the highest risk of potential fraud. Specifically, HHS-OIG officials said that in 2006 they first imposed a monetary threshold for damages caused to federal health care programs, above which the agency would pursue an agreement. HHS-OIG officials told us that they initially set this threshold at $100,000, but that in 2014 the agency increased it to $500,000 for smaller entities (i.e., those eligible for IAs) and $1 million for larger entities (i.e., those eligible for CIAs). HHS-OIG officials added that the monetary threshold is one factor that triggers pursuit of an agreement, and that risk of beneficiary harm may also cause the agency to seek an agreement, even when damages are low. HHS-OIG, in using these criteria, said that it is foregoing pursuing agreements with low-damage, lower-risk entities, instead taking no further action but reserving its exclusion authority. HHS-OIG entered into agreements with a wide range of entities, but most were concentrated among a few types of entities. Specifically, HHS-OIG entered into agreements with 30 different types of entities from July 2005 through July 2017, though slightly more than half of the agreements were with 3 types—individual/small group practices, hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities. Another quarter of the agreements were with medical group practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinics, medical device manufacturers, and ambulance companies. (See fig. 3.) HHS-OIG officials stated that it is rare for the agency to enter into multiple agreements with the same entity, adding that the few entities that have had multiple agreements were generally large corporations with multiple divisions or sites, and that the agreements applied to different areas of the firms’ business. Our analysis of HHS-OIG data showed that 15 entities had more than one agreement from July 2005 through July 2017. In other situations, HHS-OIG extended an ongoing agreement, rather than entering a new agreement with the same entity, in light of new allegations that arose during the time the agreement was in effect. From July 2005 through July 2017, the time periods for five agreements were extended beyond the standard five years to reflect new settlements with DOJ. Almost all of the agreements we reviewed were negotiated by HHS-OIG at the same time DOJ was negotiating a legal settlement with the entity to resolve related allegations under the False Claims Act. Many of these allegations resulted from cases filed by a whistleblower under the False Claims Act’s qui tam provisions—commonly referred to as qui tam cases. Slightly more than half of HHS-OIG agreements are with entities who settled qui tam cases. From July 2005 through July 2017, agreements imposed by HHS-OIG as a result of claims alleged by a whistleblower in a qui tam case increased in prevalence compared to agreements that were not associated with a qui tam case. (See fig. 4.) The DOJ-negotiated settlement amounts associated with qui tam cases, among those entities that also entered into an agreement with HHS-OIG, greatly exceeded the settlement amounts negotiated for non-qui tam cases and make up most of the total settlement amounts. From July 2005 through July 2017, total settlement amounts, among those entities that also entered into an agreement with HHS-OIG, were $16.1 billion for qui tam cases and $3.1 billion for all others. A spike in settlement amounts in 2012 reflects two settlements, one of $2 billion and another of $800 million, with two pharmaceutical manufacturers. (See fig. 5.) Although pharmaceutical manufacturers accounted for about 6 percent of entities subject to an agreement with HHS-OIG from July 2005 through July 2017, they represent a large share of the settlement amounts DOJ negotiated with those entities: $11.8 billion out of $19.2 billion (62 percent). The next largest shares of settlement amounts DOJ negotiated were with hospitals at $2.5 billion and medical device manufacturers at almost $900 million. Most of the pharmaceutical settlements associated with HHS-OIG agreements were qui tam cases (31 of 37 agreements), and a third of all qui tam settlement amounts were associated with just 4 pharmaceutical qui tam cases. HHS-OIG guidance includes the criteria that agency officials said they follow to determine whether to exercise the agency’s permissive exclusion authority, or take an alternate action, such as entering into an agreement with an entity. According to HHS-OIG officials and agency guidance, each situation is evaluated on a risk continuum and the course of action chosen is based on the agency’s assessment of the future risk the entity poses to federal health care programs. HHS-OIG has four broad categories of criteria that it applies in deciding where an entity falls on the risk continuum and which action to take. These four categories are (1) the nature and circumstances of the conduct; (2) conduct during the government’s investigation; 3) whether the entity has made efforts to improve its conduct; and 4) the entity’s history of compliance. According to HHS-OIG officials, the agency will exclude the highest-risk entities, and since fiscal year 2011, under its permissive exclusion authority, HHS-OIG has excluded 65 entities that were the subject of a related DOJ legal settlement. However, HHS-OIG guidance states that HHS-OIG often concludes that exclusion is not necessary, so long as the entity will enter into an agreement with the agency. For new agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, our review of HHS-OIG data showed that there were four main types of initial allegations that resulted in the entity entering into an agreement with HHS-OIG. This included: billing for services not rendered - 194 agreements (about 30 percent); provision of medically unnecessary services - 136 agreements (about acts prohibited under the Anti-Kickback statute - 135 agreements (about 21 percent); and misrepresentation of services and/or products – 131 agreements (about 20 percent). The majority of agreements (about 63 percent) were associated with one initial allegation. However, some agreements were associated with more than one initial allegation: about 23 percent of agreements from July 2005 through July 2017 were associated with two initial allegations and about 15 percent were associated with three or more initial allegations. We compared the provisions required in selected agreements to those outlined in HHS-OIG’s current agreement templates and found that the provisions were generally similar. All of HHS-OIG’s templates and the agreements we reviewed were organized into the same broad sections. For example, all of the templates and agreements contained sections detailing the information entities were required to submit to HHS-OIG in an initial implementation report and in annual reports, and all agreements had a section that outlined the enforcement provisions for the agreement. In addition, there generally was a standard term for agreements of either three or five years depending on the type of agreement. All 23 of the CIAs we reviewed had a term of five years, and of the nine IAs we reviewed, five had a 5-year term and four had a 3-year term. The IAs with a longer 5-year term generally were older agreements from 2010 or 2011. According to HHS-OIG officials, the current practice is to negotiate 3-year terms for IAs and 5-year terms for CIAs. HHS-OIG has developed agreement templates that include standard provisions to address the risks an entity’s noncompliance could pose to federal health care programs. Additionally, in some templates, provisions are included to address the specific types of conduct that gave rise to the agreement. HHS-OIG has four templates for use in negotiating CIAs and two for negotiating IAs, and HHS-OIG officials said that they will use one of the six templates as a starting point when drafting an agreement. HHS-OIG officials told us that the terms included in agreements are similar across CIAs and IAs because certain provisions are non- negotiable. For example, officials said that they always include provisions requiring an entity to hire a compliance officer, submit annual reports, and provide HHS-OIG with access to the entity when requested. Across the various types of templates, there are similar standard provisions, and our review of selected agreements found many of the same provisions. For example, among the 32 agreements we reviewed: All 32 agreements required the entity to engage an independent review organization to perform the agreement’s required reviews, including claims reviews. Entities have retained a variety of individuals and businesses as their independent review organization, ranging from small regional consulting firms to large national consulting or accounting firms. For agreements HHS-OIG has entered into from July 2005 through July 2017, our review of the agency’s data found that there were 173 unique associated independent review organizations. All 32 agreements had training and education requirements, although the specifics of the required training, such as the number of hours or the specific topics, varied across agreements. 28 of the 32 agreements reviewed required the entity to have a compliance officer. The four agreements that did not require this were two IAs for small group practices, one for a medical group practice, and one for a clinic that named an individual practitioner as a party to the agreement. Although agreements shared many standard provisions, some provisions were unique to either CIAs or IAs. Many of the CIAs that we reviewed included provisions detailing specific responsibilities for the entity’s board of directors (18 of 23 CIAs) and requirements for certain high-level employees to annually certify that they were in compliance with federal health care program requirements and the provisions of the agreement (12 of 23 CIAs). None of the nine IA’s we reviewed included these provisions. On the other hand, all nine IAs we reviewed (and one CIA) had provisions regarding third-party billing. If the provider subject to the agreement contracted with a third-party billing company to submit claims on the provider’s behalf, these agreements required the provider to certify that they did not have an ownership or controlling interest in the third- party billing company. In addition to agreement type, provisions also varied due to the nature of the conduct that led to the agreement or the type of entity entering into the agreement. For example, some agreements included provisions intended to ensure compliance with the Anti-Kickback statute and Stark law (8 of 32). HHS-OIG officials told us that specific provisions related to the Anti-Kickback statute and Stark law would only be present in agreements when the conduct that had led to the agreement involved acts prohibited under those statutes, such as prohibited kickbacks or improper referral arrangements. Other agreements include provisions specific to monitoring quality of care issues. For example, one of the agreements we reviewed was a quality of care CIA that required the entity to retain an independent monitor to examine, among other things, the entity’s internal quality control systems and its response to quality of care issues. In addition, 2 of the 32 agreements we reviewed were with pharmaceutical manufacturers and contained provisions not in other agreements because they would only be relevant to a pharmaceutical manufacturer. For example, both agreements we reviewed had a requirement that the manufacturers, within 30 days, provide HHS-OIG with a copy of any written communication with the Food and Drug Administration that materially discussed the actual or potential unlawful or improper promotion of the manufacturer’s product. According to HHS-OIG data, most of the 652 agreements entered into from July 2005 through July 2017 (about 95 percent) required the entity to perform at least one review as part of the agreement. The most common types of required reviews captured in HHS-OIG’s database during this time were reviews of health care claims, unallowable costs, and arrangements. Slightly more than half of the agreements (19 of 32) we reviewed required the entity to perform a claims review. Fifteen of these were annual claims reviews and four were quarterly claims reviews. In addition, slightly more than a quarter of agreements we reviewed (9 of 32) required an unallowable costs review. Finally, a quarter of the agreements (8 of 32) required the entity to perform an arrangements review. The eight agreements requiring an arrangements review were the same agreements that included a section with provisions related to compliance with the Anti-Kickback statute and Stark law. A few agreements had required reviews that were not common across the agreements we reviewed and usually related to the types of services that the entity provided. For example, three agreements we reviewed required the entity to conduct a cardiac catheterization procedures review, described as an evaluation and analysis of the medical necessity and appropriateness of interventions performed either in the entity’s cardiac catheterization lab or by the provider. According to HHS-OIG officials, the agency assigns a monitor to each agreement—an HHS-OIG staff attorney or program analyst—who, for the duration of the agreement, oversees the entity’s compliance with the terms of its agreement. Per officials and what is outlined in internal agency documents that describe how to monitor agreements, the monitors’ responsibilities include: Reviewing the information that entities provide in their initial implementation report, annual reports, and any other reports required under the agreement within the time frames established by internal HHS-OIG guidance. Communicating with entities to provide assistance to those who need help in understanding the requirements or to request additional information when a required report has missing or incomplete information. Reviewing and responding to periodic correspondence received from entities, including notifications required by the agreement, reportable event disclosures, and other communications from the entity. Drafting any letters that are sent to the entity, if noncompliance is identified, including letters demanding the payment of penalties— referred to as stipulated penalty demand letters. Conducting site visits to verify that the entities are complying with the agreements properly. According to internal HHS-OIG guidance, monitors are to select sites primarily based on concerns that they may have with specific entities, as well as other factors, such as the type of provider, the size or complexity of the entity, length of the agreement, and the severity or complexity of the offenses that resulted in the agreement. According to internal HHS-OIG guidance regarding site visit protocol and agency officials we spoke to, during site visits, HHS-OIG officials may conduct document reviews of training records, policies and procedures, or other documents; hold meetings with the compliance officer or board members; or tour the facility, among other activities. Officials said that two HHS-OIG officials typically conduct the site visit—the agreement’s monitor and one other official—and the site visits typically last about one day to a day-and-a-half. For agreements entered into from July 2005 through July 2017, we found that HHS-OIG officials conducted 211 site visits that were associated with 155 agreements. Thirty of these agreements were associated with more than one site visit ranging from 2 to 10 visits. The majority of the 211 site visits were for CIAs (about 87 percent). During the full calendar years from 2006 through 2016, HHS- OIG completed an average of 18 site visits each year. Although most entities comply with the provisions of their agreements, according to HHS-OIG officials, when noncompliance occurs, the most common issue is the late submission of required reports or reviews. According to HHS-OIG officials, other types of noncompliance range from falsely certifying the accuracy of reported information to submitting reports that do not include the required elements. According to officials and as outlined in agreements, HHS-OIG addresses noncompliance through a series of escalating steps, which, in rare instances, may result in the HHS-OIG imposing penalties on an entity as laid out in the agreement (stipulated penalties) or even exclusion of an entity from federal health care programs. Steps HHS-OIG takes to address noncompliance may include: Working with the entity before taking official action. For example, officials told us that monitors typically request additional documentation or information from providers when they identify potential issues rather than imposing stipulated penalties immediately. Demanding that the entity pay stipulated penalties. HHS-OIG will send a stipulated penalties demand letter to an entity in accordance with the breach and default terms of the agreement. The stipulated penalty amounts for noncompliance with the different provisions are specified in the agreement. According to officials, the stipulated penalty amounts in agreements are non-negotiable and the amounts associated with noncompliance with specific provisions do not change across agreements. The stipulated penalties in agreements range from $1,000 to $50,000 per violation. For example, for each day an entity fails to submit a complete annual report to HHS-OIG by the submission deadline, the stipulated penalty is $2,500 for CIAs and $1,500 for IAs. In addition, for all agreements, each false certification submitted by or on behalf of the entity results in a stipulated penalty of $50,000. For agreements entered into from July 2005 through July 2017, our review of HHS-OIG data found that HHS-OIG issued 41 letters demanding stipulated penalties (between 0 and 7 letters per year) for actions such as the failure to submit annual reports and employing individuals excluded from participation in federal health care programs. In total, HHS-OIG collected about $5.4 million in stipulated penalties during this time. Penalty amounts demanded in each letter ranged from $1,000 to over $3 million, with a median of $18,000. According to HHS-OIG, the stipulated penalty of over $3 million was a record penalty for failure to comply with an agreement. This penalty, according to HHS-OIG, resulted from the entity’s failure to correct improper billing processes and poor claims submission practices that had led to error rates and overpayments to the company by Medicare for hospice services. These issues were uncovered through the claims reviews required under the agreement and HHS-OIG’s site visits to the company’s facilities. Determining that the entity is in material breach of the agreement. As defined in agreements, this determination may result from repeated or flagrant violations of agreement obligations; failure to notify HHS-OIG of certain reportable events; failure to take corrective actions or make appropriate refunds; failure to respond to a stipulated penalties demand letter; or failure to engage an independent review organization. From July 2005 through July 2017, HHS-OIG issued 10 material breach letters to entities informing them that HHS-OIG intended to exclude them. However, the 10 material breach letters were associated with only 6 agreements, and 5 of the 10 material breach letters issued were to the same entity. These five letters were issued to the entity between March 2012 and January 2014 for a series of alleged material breaches of its agreement including, among other things, a failure to report serious quality of care reportable events or to perform training required under the terms of its agreement. This entity, which was a national chain of clinics that primarily provided dental services to children on Medicaid, was ultimately excluded in September 2014 from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicaid, for a period of five years. Excluding an entity from participation in federal health care programs. For agreements entered into from July 2005 through July 2017, we found that HHS-OIG has issued five exclusion letters to entities for failing to adhere to their agreements. These exclusion letters were associated with four agreements—2 CIAs and 2 IAs. According to HHS-OIG’s data, these exclusions occurred in 2007 (1), 2014 (1), and 2015 (2). The four entities that were excluded included a durable medical equipment provider, a national chain of clinics, a practice management company, and a medical group practice. An agreement affords the entity the opportunity to respond to a material breach letter prior to the issuance of a notice of exclusion. However, an HHS-OIG official said that, given the multiple steps involved in the breach and default process, it is unlikely that a breach would be addressed satisfactorily by the entity at this stage in the process. Of the four entities that HHS-OIG excluded, three had also previously received a notice of material breach from HHS-OIG. We provided a draft of this report to HHS and DOJ for review and comment. These departments provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.

However, HHS-OIG can enter into agreements—CIAs and IAs—with providers and other entities as an alternative to exclusion. HHS-OIG is responsible for negotiating such agreements—which it typically does at the same time the Department of Justice (DOJ) is negotiating a legal settlement to resolve related allegations—and then monitoring the entities' compliance with them. GAO was asked to review HHS-OIG's use of these agreements. This report describes (1) the number of agreements and their general characteristics; (2) the circumstances that may lead to an agreement and the standard provisions of agreements; and (3) monitoring efforts and actions taken, if any, in response to noncompliance with the agreements. GAO examined agreements entered into from July 2005 (when HHS-OIG created its database) through July 2017 (most current at the time of GAO's analyses) and used HHS-OIG data to describe agreements' characteristics and actions to address noncompliance. GAO reviewed HHS-OIG documentation, including agreement templates and a selection of agreements to identify standard provisions. GAO also interviewed HHS-OIG and DOJ officials. GAO provided a draft of this report to HHS and DOJ. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. To help improve adherence to federal health care program requirements by entities that have allegedly engaged in certain acts, such as submitting false or fraudulent claims, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) entered into 652 agreements with those entities from July 2005 to July 2017. Since 2010, two types of agreements have been used: Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIA) and Integrity Agreements (IA). The more commonly used CIAs apply to larger entities, compared to IAs, which apply to individual practitioners or small businesses. From July 2005 through July 2017, about half of all agreements were with 3 types of entities—individual or small group practices, hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities. For new agreements since July 2005, the most common initial allegations that led to an entity entering into an agreement included billing for services not provided and providing medically unnecessary services. When negotiating agreements, HHS-OIG uses one of six templates that address the different types of entities or conduct involved. Across agreements the provisions are generally similar—for example, requirements to provide training on specified topics or to hire a compliance officer. HHS-OIG uses multiple strategies to oversee agreements, such as requiring periodic reports from the entities that demonstrate compliance and assigning a monitor to review these reports and conduct site visits. HHS-OIG can also take certain actions to address noncompliance. For example, for new agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, HHS-OIG imposed monetary penalties 41 times, ranging from $1,000 to more than $3 million (median of $18,000), and excluded 4 entities from participation in federal health care programs."], "length": 4959, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d663d362cf66bb7ff5184a2186df6b6a8ce6c85a7f6091e0"}
{"input": "", "context": "The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). These acts cover workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on the length of their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all-time low of 215,000 workers in January 2010. Recently, railroad employment peaked in April 2015 to 253,000 workers, the highest level since November 1999, and then declined through FY2017, falling to 221,000 workers. The total number of beneficiaries under the RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017, and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries. Almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants. This report explains the programs under RRA and RUIA, including how each program is financed, the eligibility rules, and the types of benefits available to railroad workers and family members. It also discusses how railroad retirement relates to the Social Security system. For a quick overview of this topic, see CRS In Focus IF10481, Railroad Retirement Board: Retirement, Survivor, Disability, Unemployment, and Sickness Benefits . The RRA authorizes retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families. In December 2017, there were a total of 526,100 RRA beneficiaries, decreasing from 672,400 in 2001. This decline might partly result from the decline in railroad employment in the past five decades. The average monthly benefit for each beneficiary was about $1,986 in 2017, which increased from $1,043 in 2001, reflecting the growth in average wages and prices (see Figure 1 ). The railroad retirement, disability, and survivor program is mainly financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) (see Figure 2 ), all of which accounted for 93.9% of the $12.7 billion gross funding of the RRA program during FY2017. The remaining 6.1% of the program was financed by federal income taxes levied on railroad retirement benefits, interest on investment and other revenue, and general appropriations to pay the costs of phasing out vested dual benefits. Payroll taxes, which provided 47.0% of gross RRA funding in FY2017, are the largest funding source for railroad retirement, survivor, and disability benefits. Railroad retirement payroll taxes are divided into two tiers—Tier I and Tier II taxes. The Tier I tax is the same as the Social Security payroll tax: railroad employers and employees each pay 6.2% on earnings up to $132,900 in 2019. The Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In 2019, the Tier II tax is 13.1% for employers and 4.9% for employees on earnings up to $98,700. Tier II taxes are used to finance Tier II benefits, the portion of Tier I benefits in excess of Social Security retirement benefits (such as unreduced early retirement benefits for railroad employees with at least 30 years of railroad service), and supplemental annuities. Tier I payroll taxes are deposited in the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account (SSEBA), which pays the Social Security level of benefits and administrative expenses allocable to those benefits. The SSEBA also receives or pays the financial interchange transfers between the railroad retirement and Social Security systems. The financial interchange with Social Security provided 32.6% of gross RRA funding in FY2017. The purpose of the financial interchange is to place the Social Security trust funds in the same position they would have been in, if railroad employment had been covered under Social Security since that program's inception. Tier II tax revenues that are not needed to pay current benefits or associated administrative costs are held in the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT), which is invested in both government securities and private equities. NRRIT transfers provide another revenue source for railroad benefits, and they were 14.3% of gross RRA funding in FY2017. Prior to the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 ( P.L. 107-90 ), surplus railroad retirement assets could only be invested in U.S. government securities—just as the Social Security trust funds must be invested in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. The 2001 act established the NRRIT to manage and invest the assets in the Railroad Retirement Account in the same way that the assets of private-sector and most state and local government pension plans are invested. The remainder of the railroad retirement system's assets, such as assets in SSEBA, continues to be invested solely in U.S. government-issued or -granted securities. The combined fair market value of Tier II taxes and NRRIT assets is designed to maintain four to six years' worth of RRB benefits and administrative expenses. To maintain this balance, the Railroad Retirement Tier II tax rates automatically adjust as needed. This tax adjustment does not require congressional action, according to Section 204 of the 2001 act. To be insured for railroad benefits, a worker must generally have at least 10 years of covered railroad work or 5 years performed after 1995 and \"insured status\" under Social Security rules (generally 40 earnings credits) based on combined railroad retirement and Social Security-covered earnings. An insured railroad worker's family may be entitled to receive railroad retirement benefits. If a worker does not qualify for railroad retirement benefits, his or her railroad work counts toward Social Security benefits. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments during FY2017, 60.0% (or $7.5 billion) were paid in retirement annuities to retired workers, 8.0% (or $1.0 billion) in disability annuities, 14.4% (or $1.8 billion) in spouse annuities, and 16.8% (or $2.1 billion) in survivor annuities. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits. Tier I annuities are calculated using the Social Security benefit formula and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situation. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. At the full retirement age (FRA), which is gradually increasing from 65 to 67 for Social Security and railroad retirement beneficiaries, insured workers with fewer than 30 years of service may receive full retirement ann uities. Alternatively, workers with fewer than 30 years of service may, starting at the age of 62, receive annuities that have been reduced actuarially for the additional years the worker is expected to spend in retirement. Tier I benefit reductions for early retirement are similar to those in the Social Security system. As the FRA rises, so will the reduction for early retirement. If a railroad employee delays retirement past FRA, Tier I annuities are increased by a certain percentage for each month up until the age of 70, which is identical to the benefit increase provided by Delayed Retirement Credits under the Social Security system. In general, Social Security benefits are subtracted from Tier I annuities, because work covered by Social Security is counted toward Tier I annuities. Beneficiaries insured by both systems receive a single check from the RRB. Railroad retirement annuities may also be reduced for certain pensions earned through federal, state, and local government work that is not covered by Social Security. For early retirees who continue to work for a nonrailroad employer while receiving the retirement benefit during the year prior to FRA, Tier I benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2 earned above an exempt amount ($17,040 in 2018). After Tier I benefits are first paid, they increase annually with a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in the same manner as Social Security benefits. Retirement annuities are not payable to workers who continue to work in a covered railroad job or who return to railroad work after retirement. Tier II retirement annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities and any private pension and retirement saving plans offered by railroad employers. They are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities for current retirees are equal to seven-tenths of 1% of the employee's average monthly earnings in the 60 months of highest earnings, times the total number of years of railroad service. Tier II annuities are increased annually by 32.5% of the Social Security COLA. Tier II annuities are not (in contrast to Tier I annuities) reduced if a worker receives Social Security benefits or a government pension that was not covered by Social Security. For railroad retirees and spouses who work for their last pre-retirement nonrailroad employer while receiving retirement benefits, Tier II annuities are reduced by $1 for every $2 earned, capped at 50% of the Tier II annuity. There is no cap to the earnings-related reduction in railroad Tier I or Social Security benefits. In addition, the earnings-related reduction applies to all Tier II beneficiaries regardless of age, whereas for railroad Tier I and Social Security benefits, the earnings-related reduction applies only until the beneficiary reaches FRA. Tier II payroll taxes also finance a supplemental annuity program. Supplemental annuities are payable to employees first hired before October 1981, aged 60 with at least 30 years of covered railroad service or aged 65 and older with at least 25 years of covered railroad service, and a current connection with the railroad industry. In addition, general revenues finance a vested dual benefit for those who were insured for both railroad retirement and Social Security in 1974 when the two-tier railroad retirement benefit structure was established. Neither supplemental annuities nor vested dual benefits are adjusted for changes in the cost of living during retirement. Supplemental annuities are subject to the same earnings reductions as Tier II benefits; vested dual benefits are subject to the same earnings reductions as Tier I benefits. Railroad workers may be eligible for disability annuities if they become disabled regardless of whether the disability is caused by railroad work. The RRB determines whether a worker is disabled based on the medical evidence provided during the application process. Railroad workers found to be totally and permanently disabled from all work may be eligible for Tier I benefits at any age if the worker has at least 10 years of railroad service. Totally disabled workers may also receive Tier II benefits at the age of 62 if they have 10 or more years of service. Occupational disability annuities are also payable to workers found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations, if the worker is at least 60 years old with 10 years of service (or any age with 20 years of service), and with a current connection to the railroad industry. A five-month waiting period after the onset of disability is required before any disability annuity can be payable. Disability annuities are not payable if a worker is currently employed in a covered railroad job. Disability benefits are suspended if a beneficiary earns more than a certain amount after deducting certain disability-related work expenses. The Tier I portion of disability benefits may be reduced for the receipt of workers compensation or government disability benefits. In any month that a worker collects a railroad retirement or disability annuity, his or her spouse may also be eligible for a spousal annuity equal to or greater than the benefit he or she would have received if the worker's railroad work had been covered by Social Security. A spouse is eligible for a spousal annuity when he or she reaches the same minimum age required for the worker (i.e., either at the age of 60 or 62, depending on years of the worker's service). At any age, a spouse may be eligible for a spousal annuity if he or she cares for the worker's unmarried child under the age of 18 (or a child of any age that was disabled before the age of 22). An individual must have been married to the railroad worker for at least one year before he or she applies for the spousal annuities, with certain exceptions. A qualifying spouse receives 50% of the worker's Tier I benefit before any reductions (or, if higher, a Social Security benefit based on his or her own earnings). Spouses may also receive 45% of the worker's Tier II benefit before any reductions. Divorced spouses of retired or disabled railroad workers may also be eligible for spousal annuities. A divorced spouse may receive 50% of the worker's Tier I benefit before reductions, but no Tier II benefits. To qualify, the former spouse must have been married to the worker for at least 10 years and must not currently be married (remarriages if any must have terminated); both the worker and former spouse must be at least 62 years old. For spouses, as for railroad workers, Social Security benefits are subtracted from Tier I annuities. The Tier I portion of a spouse annuity may also be reduced for receipt of any pension from government employment not covered by Social Security based on the spouse's own earnings. Spouses are subject to reductions based on the primary worker's earnings as well as on their own earnings. For example, for early retirement, spouses are subject to different benefit reductions from workers. Finally, spouse annuities are reduced by the amount of any railroad benefits earned based on their own work. After the worker's death, surviving spouses, former spouses, children, and other dependents may be eligible to receive survivor annuities, which are paid in addition to any private life insurance offered by railroad employers. To be insured for survivor annuities, the worker must have had a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of death. Railroad survivor annuities are generally higher than comparable Social Security benefits because railroad workers' families may be entitled to Tier II annuities as well as Tier I annuities (as noted above, Tier I annuities are equivalent to Social Security benefits). In cases where no monthly survivor annuities are paid, a lump-sum payment may be made to certain survivors. The widows and widowers of railroad workers may be eligible to receive survivor annuities. At FRA, a surviving spouse may be eligible for 100% of the worker's Tier I annuity (or his or her own Social Security or railroad retirement Tier I benefit, if higher). The widow(er) may also receive up to 100% of the worker's Tier II annuity. As early as the age of 60 (or age 50, if disabled), widows and widowers may receive reduced survivor annuities. A qualifying widow(er) must have been married to the deceased railroad worker for at least nine months, with certain exceptions. At any age, a widow(er) caring for a deceased worker's child under the age of 18 may receive a survivor annuity equal to 75% of the worker's Tier I annuity, as well as up to 100% of the worker's Tier II annuity. Widow(er)s who are the natural or adoptive parent of the deceased worker's child do not have to meet the length of marriage requirement. Survivor annuities may also be payable to a surviving divorced spouse or remarried widow(er). To qualify for benefits, a surviving divorced spouse has to be married to the employee for at least 10 years and is unmarried or remarried after age 60 (age 50 for disabled surviving divorced spouse). A surviving divorced spouse who is unmarried can qualify for benefits at any age if caring for the employee's child who is under age 16 or disabled. Benefits are limited to the amounts Social Security would pay (Tier I only) and therefore are less than the amount of the survivor annuity otherwise payable. Railroad workers' children may also receive survivor annuities. To qualify, a child must be unmarried and under the age of 18 (or 19 if still in high school). Disabled adult children may qualify if their disability began before the age of 22. Eligible children receive 75% of the worker's Tier I annuity and 15% of the worker's Tier II annuity. In addition, if a worker's parent was dependent on the worker for at least half of the parent's support, he or she may receive 82.5% of the worker's Tier I annuity and 35% of the worker's Tier II annuity after reaching age 60. Survivor annuities are not payable to a current railroad employee, and survivor annuities are reduced by any railroad retirement benefit the survivor has earned through his or her own railroad work. Survivors receive the same reductions as retired workers for Social Security benefit receipt; they also have reductions from government pension receipts that are not covered by Social Security. A family maximum applies to survivor benefits, usually applicable when three or more survivors receive benefits on a worker's record (not counting divorced spouses). In summary, Table 1 provides data on railroad retirement, survivor, and disability annuities as of June 2018. Railroad workers may qualify for daily unemployment and sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). These monetary benefits are paid in addition to any paid leave or private insurance an employee may have. For sickness benefits, a worker must be unable to work because of illness or injury. Sickness benefits are distinct from disability benefits because they are intended to cover a finite, temporary period of time. Workers may not earn any money while receiving unemployment or sickness benefits. Figure 3 displays the monthly number of beneficiaries with unemployment and sickness benefits from January 2002 to July 2018, respectively. Although the number of sickness beneficiaries stayed relatively stable over time, the number of unemployment insurance beneficiaries increased significantly during and after the most recent economic recession from 2007 to 2009. Railroad unemployment and sickness benefits are financed solely by railroad employers' payroll taxes, based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Employers' tax rates depend on the past rates of unemployment and employees' sickness claims. For calendar year 2018, the employer tax rate ranges from 2.2% to 12.0% on the first $1,560 of each employee's monthly earnings. The payroll tax proceeds not needed immediately for unemployment and sickness insurance benefits or operating expenses are deposited in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account maintained by the Treasury. This account, together with similar unemployment insurance accounts for each state, forms a Federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund whose deposits are invested in U.S. government securities, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account receives interest based on these deposits. During FY2017, payroll tax contributions from railroad employers totaled $126.4 million and interest income was about $4 million. The RUIA provides for employers to pay a surcharge if the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account falls below an indexed threshold amount. The surcharge is added to the employer's tax rate. However, the total tax rate plus the surcharge cannot exceed the maximum rate of 12.0%, unless the surcharge is 3.5%, in which case the maximum tax rate is increased to 12.5%. From 2004 through 2010, the surcharge was 1.5%. The surcharge in 2011 was 2.5% and 1.5% in 2012 with no surcharges in 2013 or 2014. The surcharge in 2018 was 1.5%, the same as the level in the past three years. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The annual benefit year begins on July 1. Eligibility is based on work in the prior year, or the base year. To qualify in the benefit year beginning July 1, 2018, railroad workers must have base year earnings of $3,862.50 in calendar year 2017, counting no more than $1,545 per month. New railroad workers must also have at least five months of covered railroad work in the base year. To receive unemployment benefits, a worker must be ready, willing, and able to work. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770. However, due to sequestration pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 , as amended), the maximum daily benefit of $77 is reduced by 6.2% to $72.23 and the maximum biweekly benefit is reduced by 6.2% to $722.26 through September 30, 2019. Railroad workers receive these benefits only to the extent that they are higher than other benefits they receive under the RRA, the Social Security Act, or certain other public programs, including workers compensation. Unemployment and sickness beneficiaries may receive normal benefits for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year or until the benefits they receive equal their creditable earnings in the base year if sooner. Employees with at least 10 years of covered railroad service may qualify for extended benefits for 13 weeks after they have exhausted normal benefits.

", "answers": ["The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families. During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770. Normal benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year.

{"input": "", "context": "In analyzing the effects of U.S. individual income tax rates, it is important to be clear about which rates are being discussed. Among tax analysts, the three most widely used measures are statutory rates (STRs), marginal effective rates (MERs), and average effective rates (AERs). Each has its own applications. Those interested in how individual income taxes affect the economic behavior of households should have a clear understanding of the ways in which the three rates differ and the implications of these differences for the economic analysis of income taxes. STRs are the rates prescribed by law that apply to specified ranges of taxable income. For any individual, the applicable rate depends on her/his taxable income. Since the federal income tax is progressive in nature, taxpayers with relatively low taxable incomes face lower STRs than do taxpayers with relatively high taxable incomes. Effective rates, by contrast, whether marginal or average, measure how STRs are affected by tax provisions that modify someone's taxable income or tax liability. A taxpayer's MER shows the percentage of an additional dollar of income that is taxed, while her/his AER indicates how much of her/his total income is taxed. In general, someone's average tax rate is lower than her/his marginal tax rate. Still, for many individuals, the interaction between special provisions in the tax code and their specific financial circumstances leads to differences between their effective and statutory rates. Among the provisions that can drive a wedge between the two rates are the earned income tax credit (EITC), the alternative minimum tax (AMT), and personal exemptions and deductions. Personal circumstances that can cause MERs to diverge from STRs include the sources of income, itemized deductions, the number of children (if any) eligible for the child tax credit and the EITC, and filing status. Most economists believe that taxpayers change their economic behavior in response to MERs, not to statutory rates. Drawing on a standard model of consumer behavior, they argue that a person's MER influences important decisions concerning whether and how much to work, how much to spend, and how much to save. For example, someone's MER may help determine whether he takes on an overtime shift, bargains for wages and benefits, takes a second job, or even enters the labor force. The idea that MERs help shape an individual's economic behavior can be extended to an entire tax system, including federal payroll and excise taxes and state and local taxes. A broader analysis along these lines, however, goes beyond the scope of this report. The current income tax is largely a product of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86; P.L. 99-514 ). Among other things, the act reduced the individual tax rate structure to two statutory rates: 15% and 28%. TRA86 also imposed a 5% surcharge on the taxable income of certain upper-income households, effectively adding a third marginal tax rate of 33%. Since the enactment of TRA86, several other major changes in the federal individual income tax rate structure have been made. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90; P.L. 101-508 ) eliminated the 5% surcharge and replaced it with a statutory rate of 31%. In addition, OBRA90 imposed a limit on the amount of itemized deductions upper-income households could claim and accelerated the phaseout of personal exemptions for upper-income households. These provisions had the effect of raising effective tax rates above statutory tax rates for affected taxpayers. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93; P.L. 103-66 ) added two new statutory rates at the upper end of the income scale: 36% and 39.6%. It also delayed the indexation of the two new tax brackets for one year and permanently extended the limitation on itemized deductions and the accelerated phaseout of the personal exemption from OBRA90. Eight years later, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16 ) added a new 10% statutory rate. It also included a phased-in reduction in the top four statutory rates to 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. Several other provisions of the act modified the tax brackets and limitations on personal exemptions and deductions for higher-income taxpayers. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA; P.L. 108-27 ), the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 (WFTRA; P.L. 108-311 ), and the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA; P.L. 109-222 ) collectively accelerated and extended the tax rate reductions enacted under EGTRRA through 2010. Under a last-minute agreement between President Obama and congressional leaders from both parties, Congress extended the Bush-era individual income tax cuts through 2012 under the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (TRUC; P.L. 111-312 ). Facing the unwanted prospect of an across-the-board increase in all STRs, the 112 th Congress permanently extended (through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 [ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ]) each of the Bush-era STRs, with one exception: the top rate increased from 35% to 39.6%. Six years passed before Congress made another significant change in individual income tax rates. Through P.L. 115-97 , often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress temporarily reduced five of the seven individual income tax rates under prior law. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, individual income tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%; they are set to return to the levels that applied in 2017, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026. Each act is described in greater detail below. Among its many changes, TRA86 simplified the individual income tax rate structure for tax years after 1987 by replacing the 14 nonzero statutory rates that applied to the 1985 and 1986 tax years with two such rates: 15% and 28%. Table 3 shows the key elements of the 1988 tax rate structure. These rates applied to capital income as well as to labor income. Although TRA86 established only two statutory individual marginal income tax rates, it included a 5% surcharge on the taxable income of certain upper-income households. This surcharge effectively created a third statutory tax rate of 33% (a 28% statutory tax rate plus a 5% surcharge). Because the surcharge phased in over a certain range of income and then phased out as income increased, statutory tax rates rose to 33% but then fell back to 28%, producing what was known as an income tax rate \"bubble.\" The intent of the surcharge was two-fold: (1) to prevent TRA86 from changing the distribution of the income tax burden among income groups, relative to the distribution under pre-1986 tax law, and (2) to meet specific revenue targets. More specifically, the surcharge was designed to eliminate the tax benefits of both the 15% tax bracket and the personal exemption for upper-income households. For joint returns in 1988, the phaseout of the 15% tax rate started when taxable income exceeded $71,900 and ended when it reached $149,250. For single returns, the 15% tax bracket phased out when taxable income was between $47,050 and $97,620. For heads of households, the phaseout occurred when taxable income fell in the range of $67,200 to $134,930. The phaseout of the personal exemption started immediately after the phaseout of the 15% tax bracket and occurred sequentially for each exemption. This meant that the taxable income range over which the 5% surcharge offset personal exemptions depended on the number of personal exemptions claimed on the tax return. For example, on a joint return claiming two personal exemptions, the 5% surcharge would apply to taxable income between $149,250 and $171,090 ($149,250 plus two times $10,920). On a joint return with four personal exemptions, the 5% surcharge would apply to taxable income between $149,250 and $192,930 ($149,250 plus four times $10,920). To demonstrate how the 5% surcharge worked to \"phase out\" the tax benefits of the 15% tax bracket, consider the following example based on joint returns for 1988. The difference between taxing the first $29,750 of taxable income at 28% instead of 15% was $3,867.50 (obtained as $29,750 multiplied by 13%, the difference between 28% and 15%). Five percent of the difference between the upper and lower phaseout limits also equaled $3,867.50 ($149,250 less $71,900 multiplied by 5%). Hence, assessing the 5% surcharge on taxable income between $78,400 and $162,770 was equivalent to taxing the first $32,450 of taxable income at 28% rather than 15%. OBRA90 created a three-tiered statutory marginal income tax rate structure. The rates were 15%, 28%, and 31% and applied to tax years beginning in 1991 and thereafter (see Table 5 ). OBRA90 eliminated the tax rate bubble created by TRA86, and replaced it with a limitation on itemized deductions and a new approach to phasing out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upper-income households. OBRA90 also reintroduced a tax-rate differential for capital gains income. The act limited the tax on capital gains income to a maximum of 28%, starting in 1991. Under TRA86, capital gains was treated as ordinary income and taxed at regular rates that peaked at 33%. OBRA90's limitation on itemized deductions was based on a taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI). For tax years starting in 1991 to 1995, allowable deductions were reduced by 3% of the amount by which a taxpayer's AGI exceeded $100,000 (or $50,000 in the case of married couples filing separate returns). For example, if a taxpayer's AGI in 1991 was $110,000, then his itemized deductions would have been reduced by $300 ($110,000 less $100,000 multiplied by .03). This provision effectively raised the marginal income tax rate of affected taxpayers by approximately one percentage point. A dollar of income in excess of $100,000 was taxed as if it were $1.03, since in addition to the tax on an extra dollar of income, the taxpayer lost a tax deduction by giving up $0.03 of itemized deductions. This limitation was scheduled to expire after tax year 1995 under OBRA90, but was later extended. Allowable deductions for medical expenses, casualty and theft losses, and investment interest were not subject to this limitation. For tax years after 1991, the $100,000 threshold was indexed for inflation. OBRA90 phased out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for higher-income households. Each personal exemption was phased out by a factor of 2% for each $2,500 (or fraction thereof) by which a taxpayer's AGI exceeded a given threshold amount. In 1991, the threshold amounts were $150,000 for a joint return, $100,000 for a single return, and $125,000 for a head-of- household return. Starting in 1992, these amounts were indexed for inflation. The phaseout provision was scheduled to expire at the end of 1995. A simple example illustrated how the personal exemption phaseout increased the tax burden on affected taxpayers. In 1991, a joint household whose AGI was $183,000 would have lost 28% of their total personal exemptions. The AGI amount in excess of the threshold in this instance would have been $33,000, or $183,000 AGI minus the $150,000 threshold limit. The $33,000 excess divided by $2,500 would produce a factor of 13.2, which when rounded up would equal 14. This figure is multiplied by 2% to arrive at the final disallowance amount of 28%. Hence, if the family had claimed two personal exemptions, which at $2,150 each would have totaled $4,300, they would have been allowed to deduct $3,096 ($4,300 total personal exemptions less the $1,204 disallowance, which is 28% of the total). OBRA93 made several changes in the individual marginal income tax rate structure. First, it added two new marginal tax rates, 36% and 39.6%, at the upper end of the income spectrum. The 39.6% tax bracket was the result of adding a 10% surtax to the 36% rate for taxpayers with taxable incomes over $250,000 in 1993. Although OBRA93 was enacted in August 1993, the increase in the top marginal tax rates was made effective retroactively to January 1, 1993. Affected taxpayers, however, were not assessed penalties for underpayment of 1993 taxes resulting from the tax rate increase. Taxpayers were also allowed to pay any additional 1993 taxes in three equal installments over a two-year period. Second, OBRA93 delayed indexation of the new top marginal income tax brackets for one year. Hence, the nominal dollar tax brackets for the 36% and 39.6% marginal tax rates remained at the same level for both tax years 1993 and 1994. Finally, OBRA93 made permanent both the itemized deduction limitation and the phaseout of the tax benefits from personal exemptions. EGTRRA made several major changes to the marginal tax rate structure. Many of the act's provisions were set to phase in over a period of time, but subsequent legislation, described in the next section, overrode the schedule originally set by EGTRRA. All of the EGTRRA provisions, as amended, were set to expire at the end of 2010. First, the 2001 act created a new 10% bracket. It applied, beginning in tax year 2002, to the first $12,000 of taxable income for married couples filing jointly, the first $10,000 of taxable income for heads of households, and the first $6,000 of taxable income for single individuals. For tax year 2001, the act created a \"rate reduction tax credit,\" mimicking the effects of the 10% tax rate bracket for most taxpayers. EGTRRA gradually phased in and expanded the bracket over several years, but in 2003-2007, these provisions of EGTRRA were accelerated by subsequent legislation. In 2008, EGTRRA became effective again, setting the 10% marginal tax rate bracket at $7,000 for single filers and $14,000 for joint filers. Starting with tax year 2009, these bracket amounts were indexed for inflation. Second, the 2001 act gradually reduced the top four marginal income tax rates. Under prior income tax law, the top four marginal tax rates were 28%, 31%, 36%, and 39.6%. When fully phased in, the 2001 act reduced the top four marginal income tax rates to 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. Once again, under EGTRRA the reductions were scheduled to take place in 2001 through 2006, but subsequent legislation accelerated the EGTRRA phase-in schedule. Third, EGTRRA also repealed the limitation on itemized deductions and personal exemptions for high-income taxpayers. The repeal was phased in between 2006 and 2009. The limitation was completely repealed for 2010, but it was scheduled to reappear again in 2011, once the EGTRRA's tax cuts expire. Fourth, some of the act's measures designed to reduce the marriage penalty affected the rate bracket structure. The act increased the income range of the 15% tax bracket for married couples filing joint returns to twice the income range of the 15% tax bracket for single returns. Under EGTRRA, this provision was scheduled to phase in from 2005 to 2008, but subsequent legislation accelerated the phase-in. Under EGTRRA, the upper dollar limit of the 15% tax bracket for joint returns was set at 180% of the upper dollar limit of the 15% tax bracket for single returns in 2005, 187% of that limit in 2006, 193% of that limit in 2007, and 200% of that limit in 2008 and subsequent years. Finally, the 2001 act increased the standard deduction for joint returns to twice the size of the standard deduction for single returns. The change was scheduled to be phased in over a five-year period, 2005 to 2009, but it was accelerated by the subsequent bills as well. This had the effect of raising the lower income threshold of the lowest tax bracket for married taxpayers. JGTRRA accelerated several changes to the individual income tax rate structure that were first enacted under EGTRRA. It moved forward to 2003 the tax rate reductions, the expansion of the 10% tax bracket, and the widening of the 15% tax bracket for joint returns to make it double the width of the 15% tax bracket for single returns. Under EGTRRA, some of these changes would not have been fully phased in until 2009. JGTRRA also lowered the tax rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. It reduced the top rate to 15%, and allowed a rate of 0% for certain low-income taxpayers. WFTRA extended several tax provisions of JGTRRA that were scheduled to expire at the end of 2004. It extended the expansion of the 10% income tax bracket through 2007, at which point EGTRRA's relevant provisions would be fully phased in, maintaining a constant amount of tax relief. WFTRA also extended marriage penalty relief under EGTRRA from 2005 to 2008. The standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly was set to be equal to double the standard deduction for an unmarried single filer over that period. In addition, the act made the size of the 15% tax bracket for joint filers double that of the tax bracket for single filers from 2005 to 2007. As a result, in both cases, the marriage penalty relief extended from 2005 to 2010, before ending under the EGTRRA sunset provision. The reductions in tax rates for long-term capital gains and dividends under JGTRRA were set to expire at the end of 2008; TIPRA extended them through the end of 2010. A last-minute agreement in 2010 between President Obama and congressional leaders of both parties cleared the way for an extension of all the Bush-era individual tax cuts through the end of 2012. TRUC served as the legislative vehicle for the extension. Facing a reversion of each statutory individual income tax rate to its level before the enactment of EGTRRA starting January 1, 2013, Congress and President Obama agreed on legislation (ATRA) to extend permanently each of the Bush-era rates and restore the top marginal tax rate to its pre-EGTRRA level of 39.6%. The act also permanently extended the repeal of the phaseout of the personal exemption included in EGTRRA, but it restricted the repeal of the phaseout to taxpayers with AGIs of $250,000 or less for single filers and $300,000 or less for married couples filing jointly. Taxpayers with AGIs above these inflation-adjusted amounts were subject to the phaseout. The same rule applied to the repeal under EGTRRA of the Pease limitation on the amount of itemized deductions an upper-income taxpayer could take. Individual marginal income tax rates did not change after ATRA until the enactment of P.L. 115-97 in December 2017. The act made significant changes to a number of individual income tax provisions, including individual tax rates and the standard deduction. For tax years beginning in 2018 and ending before 2027, the individual income tax rate structure consists of seven brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. (The rates are scheduled to revert to their levels in 2017 starting in 2026.) For individuals receiving income from passthrough businesses (i.e., partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships), the current rates can be adjusted downward as a result of a new deduction under Section 199A; the deduction is equal to up to 20% of a noncorporate business owner's qualified income from a qualified trade or business. The 2017 tax revision also made the following changes in these key elements of the individual income tax for the 2018 to 2025 tax years: It terminated the personal exemption (which was $4,050 in 2017). It increased the standard deduction (which is indexed for inflation using the chained consumer price index for urban consumers) for nonitemizers to $24,000 for joint filers and $18,000 for head-of-household filers, and $12,000 for single filers, from 2018 to 2025. It eliminated the deduction for miscellaneous expenses from 2018 through 2025. It suspended the overall limit on itemized deductions for certain high-income taxpayers. During periods of relatively high inflation, a progressive income tax based on tax brackets set in nominal dollars can lead to automatic tax increases, and these increases can lead to unintended changes in the overall distribution of the tax burden by income class. This is because nominal incomes rise faster than real incomes, all other things being equal. As a result, tax burdens for taxpayers become larger than what lawmakers had intended when they established existing statutory tax rates. In the absence of indexation of the elements of the tax code determining the tax burdens of individuals, an increasing share of taxpayers will face growing tax liabilities because their nominal incomes are rising, irrespective of what happens to their real incomes. The effects of inflation on income tax liabilities can be substantial, even in periods of low inflation, such as the last two decades. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $1,000 in November 1988 had the buying power of $2,095.08 in November 2018. Year-to-year changes can be negligible, but over a decade or so, those changes can add up to make a substantial difference through the power of compounding. A simplified hypothetical example illustrates the impact that a lack of indexation can have over time for the tax burdens (as measured by the average income tax rate) of individual taxpayers. The results are summarized in Table 1 . Assume that the individual income tax structure from 1988 applied without indexation (or any other changes) in 2017. Also assume that a household with a husband, wife, and two children had an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $35,000 in 1988, was eligible for no tax credits, and filed a joint tax return. If the family took the standard deduction, then its taxable income would have been $22,200 ($35,000 minus the standard deduction of $5,000 and four personal exemptions at $1,950 apiece), and its tax liability would have been $3,330. As a result, the household's average tax rate was 9.5% ($3,330 divided by $35,000 income) in 1988. Next consider what would happen to the household's tax burden in 2017 if the family's income had kept up with inflation but the 1988 tax structure had remained in place, with no indexation for inflation. The family's AGI would have been $71,766: $35,000 x 2.05 (the rise in the general price level as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from 1988 to 2017). Its taxable income would have been $58,966; its tax liability would have totaled $12,643; and its average tax rate would have reached 17.6%. So in the absence of the indexation of the key income tax elements when the family's AGI rose in step with the rate of consumer inflation, keeping the buying power of its income constant, the family's income tax burden increased by 85% from 1988 to 2017. This difference exemplifies what is known as \"bracket creep,\" an effect that is accelerated during periods of high inflation. Under an indexed individual income tax, however, the household would have experienced no change in their tax burden. With an inflation adjustment equal to the rise in the CPI-U, the value of the standard deduction for a joint return would have increased from $5,000 in 1988 to $10,252 in 2017, and the personal exemption for each family member would have increased from $1,950 to $3,998. Under these circumstances, the family's 2017 taxable income would have been $45,522 ($71,766 in income less the inflation-adjusted standard deduction and four personal exemptions). Tax brackets would have adjusted as well. Based on this taxable income and the adjusted brackets, their income tax liability would have been $6,828, yielding an average tax rate of 9.5%, the same as in 1988. While the nominal household's amount of income and tax owed rose, the value of both in 1988 dollars stayed approximately the same. Congress added indexation to the individual income tax as a part of the package of statutory tax rate reductions included in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. The U.S. rate of inflation was exceptionally high at the time, and this condition influenced congressional deliberations on the benefits of tax indexation. As the Joint Committee on Taxation noted in its explanation of the act: The Congress believed that \"automatic\" tax increases resulting from the effects of inflation were unfair to taxpayers, since their tax burden as a percentage of income could increase during intervals between tax reduction legislation, with an adverse effect on incentives to work and invest. In addition, the Federal Government was provided with an automatic increase in its aggregate revenue, which in turn created pressure for further spending. Since 1981, the list of indexed elements has gradually expanded and now includes more than three dozen tax items. TRA86 extended indexation to some newly created tax provisions, including the standard deductions for the elderly and the blind and the EITC. EGTRRA indexed the phaseout amounts for the EITC, starting in 2008. Table 2 lists the major indexed tax items and notes the first year of the adjustment. Indexing may compound the complexity of the individual income tax, but, given its benefits to taxpayers over time, this effect is arguably a minor matter. The year-to-year changes in dollar amounts are usually small, so taxpayers seldom, if ever, face unexpected changes that might materially affect them. On the revenue side, of course, indexing results in lower government receipts. But some key elements of the tax remain unadjusted for inflation. One such element is the child tax credit. Under current law, the amount of the credit itself and the phaseout thresholds for higher-income taxpayers are not adjusted for inflation. But the earned income threshold used in calculating the credit's refundable amount has been adjusted for inflation since 2001. Consequently, under current law, inflation erodes the value of the credit and reduces the number of eligible taxpayers over time. Another element not indexed for inflation is the threshold amounts for determining who pays the 3.8% tax on net investment income that was added in 2013. Most elements are indexed using the technical calculation described below. In some instances, the calculation methodology differs somewhat. Examples include the EITC or transportation benefits. The variations are insignificant, as long as they do not lead to systematic deviations from the actual rate of inflation. The adjustment for tax years before 2019 was based on the percentage by which the average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the 12 months ending on August 31 of the preceding year exceeded the average CPI-U during a 12-month base period. Not all indexed tax elements used the same base period, as shown in Table 2 . With the exception of the EITC, inflation adjustments were rounded down to the nearest multiple of $50. Although rounding down affected the accuracy of any given year's inflation adjustment, the effect was not cumulative since each year's adjustment reflected the total inflation that occurred between the adjustment year and the base period. For example, the adjustment factor for the personal exemption in 2017 was calculated as follows. By law, the base period for this factor was September 1987 through August 1988, when the average CPI-U was 116.6. The average CPI-U for September 2015 through August 2016, on which the 2017 value is based, was 238.6. Thus, the inflation adjustment factor in 2017 was 2.05 (238.6/116.6). This factor was then applied to $2,000, the value of the exemption in 1989, resulting in a personal exemption of $4,080 for the 2017 tax year. Rounding this number down to the nearest multiple of $50 produced the final value of the exemption in 2017: $4,050. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2018, a different consumer price index will be used to adjust the values of income tax elements subject to indexation. Under a provision of P.L. 115-97 , the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) replaces the CPI-U for this purpose. Both indices were designed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to measure price changes faced by the average urban consumer. Each of them tracks the prices of about 80,000 goods and services each month in cities throughout the United States. The BLS bases the indices on a fixed basket of goods and services obtained from a survey of the spending patterns of 7,000 American families. The survey determines which goods and services go into the basket and how much weight should be assigned to each item in calculating the overall change in prices. The market basket for the CPI-U is revised every two years. Many analysts have argued that the CPI-U overstates rises in the cost of living because it does not fully account for the changes consumers make in their buying patterns when the price of one item in the market basket goes up or the price of another goes down. When this tendency to substitute lower-priced items for other items whose prices have increased is ignored, the impact on consumers of inflation is overstated. The chained CPI-U is better at capturing changes in consumer spending patterns tied to price increases or decreases. This is because it compares details about what a consumer buys in the period before a price change with details about what he/she buys in the period after the change. In essence, the BLS calculates one measure of inflation for the first-period basket and a second measure of inflation for the second-period basket and then takes the average. The basket after the price change may contain different amounts of some items, as consumers respond to increases or decreases in the prices of other items in the same categories. For instance, the second-period basket may include more chicken than the first-period basket did when the price of beef increases while the price of chicken remains unchanged. This substitution softens the impact of the price rise for beef on the overall measure of inflation. The chained CPI-U does this every month, creating an index that links these changes from month to month. As a result, the index reflects shifts in consumer buying patterns between months and between basket items. It also leads to lower estimates of the rate of increase in the cost of living over time, since the chained CPI-U is built around the tendency of consumers in general to purchase lower-priced items that can be substituted for items whose prices have risen. From 2000 to 2012, the annual average for the chained CPI-U rose by 29.4%. In the same period, the CPI-U's annual average increased by 33.3%. Many analysts have noted that using the chained CPI-U to adjust the amount of individual income tax elements for inflation has one significant drawback: the index is revised several times, while the CPI-U is never revised. A final reading for the chained CPI-U is released between 10 and 16 months after its initial release. Consequently, starting in 2018, tax elements that are adjusted for inflation are indexed to a preliminary estimate that could be significantly revised. Switching to the chained CPI-U to adjust key tax elements for inflation is likely to result in more bracket creep than would occur if the elements were still adjusted for inflation using the CPI-U. Since the chained CPI-U increases more slowly than the CPI-U, tax bracket thresholds are likely to rise by smaller amounts from one year to the next. More individual taxpayers will be pushed into higher tax brackets than they would be if the CPI-U were still used for inflation adjustment. One significant result is an increase in federal tax revenue over time. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that the revenue gain from switching to the chained CPI-U will total $134 billion from FY2018 to FY2027. Since the onset of the Great Recession in late 2007, the annual U.S. inflation rate has fluctuated between -0.4% and 3.2%, as measured by the CPI-U. Negative inflation, or deflation, occurred in 2009 relative to 2008. Deflation denotes a decrease in the general price level. As a result, the inflation adjustments in 2010 were very small or nonexistent. Several other federal programs experienced similar situations, even though they do not use the same indexing methodology. For example, there was no cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits in 2010. If the United States were to experience a period of sustained deflation, the income tax elements could decline in constant dollars. By law, however, the elements cannot fall below their base-year values. Since their current values are much higher than their base values, which were established years ago in some cases, and the near-term outlook for inflation is projecting rates below 3%, this limitation is unlikely to come into play anytime soon for most indexed elements. The following tables present the personal exemption amounts, standard deductions, and statutory marginal tax rates schedules for each tax year from 1988 through 2019.", "answers": ["Statutory individual income tax rates are the tax rates that apply by law to various amounts of taxable income. Statutory rates form the basis of marginal effective and average effective tax rates, which most economists believe have a greater impact on the economic behavior of companies and individuals than do statutory rates. Marginal effective rates capture the net effect of special tax provisions on statutory rates. They differ from average effective rates, which measure someone's overall income tax burden. Current statutory and effective individual tax rates are the result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86; P.L. 99-514) and several tax laws that have been enacted since then. Of particular importance among the latter are the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90; P.L. 101-508), the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93; P.L. 103-66), the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16), the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (TRUC; P.L. 111-312), the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA, P.L. 112-240), and the tax rate changes contained in the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97). TRA86 altered the income tax rate structure. EGTRRA established what are referred to as the Bush-era tax cuts for individuals. TRUC extended those cuts for another two years, through 2012. ATRA permanently extended the Bush-era tax rates for taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000 for single filers and $450,000 for joint filers but reinstated the 39.6% top rate established by OBRA93 for taxpayers with taxable incomes equal to or above those amounts. And P.L. 115-97 lowered individual tax rates for all income groups except those subject to the 10% and 35% brackets under previous law. Ordinary income is taxed at seven statutory individual income tax rates, from 2018 to 2026: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. (Starting in 2026, these rates will revert to their levels in 2017.) Income from long-term capital gains and dividends is taxed at 0% for single filers with capital gains below $39,375 (below $78,750 for joint filers), 15% for single filers with capital gains between $39,375 and $434,550 (between $78,750 and $488,850 for joint filers), and 20% for single filers with capital gains above $434,550 (above $488,850 for joint filers). Since 2013, a 3.8% tax has been imposed on the lesser of net investment income received by individuals, estates, or trusts, or the amount of their modified adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 for joint filers and $125,000 for single filers. In addition, the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT), which functions like a separate income tax in that its rate structure is narrower and tax base broader than those of the regular income tax, applies to income above exemption amounts in 2019 of $111,700 for joint filers and $71,700 for single filers; the AMT taxes income at two rates: 26% and 28%. Tax rates and the income brackets to which they apply are not the only elements of the individual income tax that determine the tax liabilities of taxpayers. Personal exemptions, exclusions, deductions, credits, and certain other elements have an effect as well. Some of these elements are indexed for inflation. Congress added annual indexation to the individual income tax in 1981, using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. Such a mechanism helps prevent tax increases and unintended shifts in the distribution of the tax burden that are driven by inflation alone. The indexed elements are tax rate brackets, personal exemptions and their phaseout threshold, standard deductions, the itemized deduction limitation threshold, and the exemption amounts for the AMT. Starting in 2018, these items are indexed for inflation with the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. This report summarizes the tax brackets and other key elements of the individual income tax that help determine taxpayers' marginal and average effective tax rates going back to 1988. It will be updated to reflect indexation adjustments and changes in the taxation of individual income."], "length": 6032, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6072c66babdeec69117aaa8acb79ce5d5e35269f2031c8a8"}
{"input": "", "context": "The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), as amended, establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration. The act also generally defines the federal government’s role during the response and recovery after a disaster and establishes the programs and process through which the federal government provides disaster assistance to state, local governments, tribal entities and individuals. In addition to its central role in recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster, FEMA has primary responsibility for coordinating the federal response when a disaster is declared as well as recovery, which typically consists of providing grants to assist state and tribal entities to alleviate the damage resulting from such disasters. Once a disaster is declared, FEMA provides assistance through the IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. For instance, some declarations may provide grants only for IA and others only for Public Assistance. Hazard Mitigation Assistance grants, on the other hand, are available for all declarations if the affected area has a FEMA-approved Hazard Mitigation plan. The process for requesting assistance is the same for the three types of assistance. Under the Stafford Act, states’ governors or tribal chief executives may request federal assistance, if state and tribal resources are overwhelmed after a disaster. As part of the request to the President, a governor or tribal chief executive must affirm that the state or tribe has implemented an emergency plan and that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state or tribal entity, among other things. After a state or tribe submits a request for disaster declaration through FEMA’s regional office, the regional office is to evaluate the request and make a regional recommendation through the RVAR, which is submitted to FEMA headquarters for further review. The FEMA administrator then is to review the state’s or tribe’s request and the RVAR, and recommend to the President whether a disaster declaration is warranted. Figure 1 shows the process for a disaster declaration from the time a disaster occurs until the President approves or denies a declaration request. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. The IA comprises five different programs as shown below. When states or tribal entities request disaster declarations, they may request assistance under any or all of the five programs. Likewise, when the President makes a disaster declaration, the declaration may authorize IA which may also include any or all of the five IA programs. 1. Individuals and Households Program provides assistance to eligible disaster survivors with necessary expenses and serious needs which they are unable to meet through other means, such as insurance. According to FEMA headquarter officials, direct assistance is provided to individuals to meet housing needs. 2. Crisis Counseling Program assists individuals and communities by providing community-based outreach and psycho-educational services. 3. Disaster Legal Services provides assistance through an agreement with the Young Lawyers Division of the American Bar Association for free legal help to survivors who are unable to secure legal services adequate to meet their disaster-related needs. 4. Disaster Case Management Program involves a partnership between a FEMA disaster case manager and a survivor to develop and carry out a Disaster Recovery Plan. 5. Disaster Unemployment Assistance provides unemployment benefits and reemployment services to individuals who have become unemployed as a result of a major disaster and who are not eligible for regular state unemployment insurance. In accordance with its responsibilities under the Stafford Act, FEMA issued a regulation in 1999 that outlines the six factors regional and headquarters officials are to consider when assessing requests for a disaster declaration and when developing a recommendation to the President for a federal disaster declaration. The regulation states that FEMA considers the six factors not only to evaluate the need for IA but also to measure the severity, magnitude, and impact of the disaster. The state or tribe provides information on these factors when submitting its disaster declaration request. The six factors for IA include the following: 1. Concentration of Damages—characterizes the density of the damage in individual communities. The regulation states that highly concentrated damages “generally indicate a greater need for federal assistance than widespread and scattered damages throughout a state.” For example, concentration of damage data includes the numbers of homes destroyed, homes with major or minor damages, and homes affected. 2. Trauma—the regulation provides conditions that might cause trauma including large numbers of injuries and deaths, large-scale disruption of normal community functions, and emergency needs such as extended loss of power or water. 3. Special Populations—FEMA considers the impact of the disaster on special populations, such as low-income populations, the elderly, or the unemployed. 4. Voluntary Agency Assistance—involves the availability and capabilities of voluntary, faith, and community-based organizations, and state and local programs to help meet both the emergency and recovery needs of individuals affected by disasters. 5. Insurance Coverage—addresses the level of insurance coverage among those affected by disasters. Because disaster assistance cannot duplicate insurance coverage, as recognized in the regulation, if a disaster occurred where almost all of the damaged dwellings were fully insured for the damage that was sustained, FEMA could conclude that a disaster declaration by the President was not necessary in accordance with this factor. 6. Average Amount of Individual Assistance by State—according to the regulation, there is no set threshold for recommending IA. However, it states that the averages, depicted in table 1, may prove useful to states and voluntary agencies as they develop plans and programs to meet the needs of disaster victims. The inference is that these averages generally indicate the amount of damages that could be expected for a state based on its size (small, medium, and large). The averages contained within the regulation and depicted in table 1 are based on disasters that occurred between July of 1994 and July of 1999. The President declared 57 percent of all IA declaration requests from calendars years 2008 through 2016, with total IA obligations of approximately $8.6 billion. FEMA received 294 IA declaration requests from calendar years 2008 through 2016. Of these, the President declared 168 requests (57 percent), and 51 percent of these declarations were from Regions IV and VI, as shown in table 2. Additionally, of the 126 IA declaration requests denied by the President, Regions X and IX had the highest percentage of denials, at 71 percent (10 out of 14) and 67 percent (12 out of 18), respectively, and Region I had the lowest percentage of denials at 13 percent (2 out of 15), as shown in table 3. See appendix I for the number of IA declarations requested, declared, and denied by states and tribes from each FEMA region for disaster declarations requested from calendar years 2008 through 2016. According to a FEMA headquarters official, when a disaster declaration is denied, FEMA sends a denial letter to states or tribes based on the review of all the information available. The letter generally states that the damage was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies, and accordingly the supplemental federal assistance is not necessary. Of the emergency management officials we interviewed in 11 states, officials in five states reported that FEMA provided a rationale behind the denial, while officials in three states reported that no rationale was provided. Among the various types of disasters for which IA declaration requests were received, severe storms, flooding, and tornados accounted for the highest number of IA requests, with drought, fishery closure, and contaminated water being the least common, as shown in table 4. FEMA obligated a total of approximately $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016. These actual obligations were provided to 46 states and they ranged from less than $1 million to more than $1 billion as shown in figure 2. See appendix II for FEMA’s IA actual obligations by state and type of disasters for disaster declarations made from calendars years 2008 through 2016. Additionally, actual obligations for IA declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016 varied greatly by FEMA region, as also shown in figure 3. For example, FEMA Region VI had the highest obligations at around $3.3 billion. Region X had the lowest obligations at $24.8 million. As shown in table 5, the amount of obligations for disasters declarations also varied greatly by state. For example, Louisiana had the highest obligations at approximately $2 billion, followed by New York and Texas at about $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The state with the lowest obligations was the U.S. Virgin Islands at about $2,100. Six of FEMA’s 10 regional offices reported using all six regulatory factors when evaluating states’ or tribes’ IA declaration requests. Officials from the other 4 regions reported using five of the six factors, with the exception being the average amount of individual assistance by state factor. These officials noted that they do not use this factor because FEMA considers the factor to be outdated or they consider all of the factors holistically. Officials from FEMA’s regional offices also generally reported that the extent to which they consider the six IA regulatory factors equally in all cases varies, depending on the circumstances of the related disaster. Specifically, officials from 7 of the 10 regions stated that they use the regulatory factors on a case-by-case basis as certain factors are more relevant than others based on the disaster. For example, if a tornado hits a rural community and completely destroys all properties within the community with no death or injury, then the regulatory factor for trauma may not be as applicable, while the concentration of damages regulatory factor would have greater relevance. On the other hand, if a tornado hits the center of a town resulting in damages with death and injuries, then the trauma regulatory factor would become more important to consider. Additionally, officials in 3 of the 10 regions reported that in addition to the six regulatory factors, they also take into account institutional knowledge and staff experience when evaluating the regulatory factors. For example, officials in one region stated that their staff have more than 10 years of IA declaration experience, and as such, they are familiar with the extent of the information needed and collect the information accordingly. Based on our analysis of RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016 used to recommend approving or denying IA requests, FEMA regional offices did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the IA regulatory factors. As described earlier, FEMA regions are to use the RVAR to document information on the IA factors and to recommend to the FEMA administrator whether a disaster should be declared. According to FEMA headquarters officials, FEMA developed the RVAR template in June 2012 to help ensure consistency across regions when making recommendations to headquarters on IA declaration requests. Officials stated that prior to the template, information on the six factors was mainly provided in narrative format. The new template listed the various elements found within each of the six regulatory factors, guiding the regional offices to provide information based on those elements. For example, instead of providing a general narrative on the trauma factor, the new template listed the elements to be provided under trauma, such as the number of injuries and deaths, as well as information on power outages and disruption of other community functions and services. Also, instead of summarizing the concentration of damages factor, the template allowed regional offices to categorize the damage concentration as low, medium, high, or extreme. Furthermore, the template also provided a uniform format to present quantitative information such as the number of homes destroyed; whether home damages are major or minor; the number of homes affected; and level of home ownership. See appendix III for a sample RVAR template. We analyzed 81 RVARs developed by the 10 FEMA regions from July 2012 through December 2016 and found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements related to each of the six regulatory factors in their RVARs. As shown in table 6, all 81 RVARs had at least some elements documented but not all for each of the IA regulatory factors. For example, for the IA concentration of damages regulatory factor, the six elements to be addressed include the number of homes destroyed, damaged or affected, damage concentration, and damage to critical facilities. While 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all of the six elements, 37 documented some but not all of the elements. Similarly, for the trauma regulatory factor, the four elements to be addressed include injuries, death, power outages, and disruption of community functions. While 30 of the 81 RVARs documented all of the four elements, 51 documented some but not all of the elements. For the insurance coverage factor, while five RVARs documented all of the elements, 73 RVARs documented some but not all of the elements. Elements under this factor include home ownership, insurance, and flood insurance, when applicable. None of the six regulatory factors were fully documented across all RVARs. See appendix IV for detailed information on the extent to which all of the elements of the six regulatory factors were documented in the RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016. FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged that information related to all the elements for each of the IA regulatory factors were missing from the RVARs. They stated that they had not collected all information on all factors because one factor may have more weight than another based on the specific incident that has occurred. However, they also indicated that they do not fully know and have not evaluated all of the reasons why a region may have omitted information on an element of a factor. FEMA headquarters officials agreed that having complete information on all elements of the regulatory factors in the RVARs would assist in their recommendation process. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government suggest that agencies should establish and operate monitoring activities to ensure that internal controls—such as the documentation of all of the elements of the IA regulatory factors FEMA regions considered—are effective, and to take corrective actions as appropriate. Because it is unclear why regions are not completely documenting all elements related to the current six regulatory factors, such an evaluation could help FEMA identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Doing so could help FEMA ensure it is achieving its stated goals in providing consistency in the evaluation process and in the types of factors it considers. Officials we interviewed in 9 of the 10 FEMA regions and state emergency management offices in all 11 states reported the positive relationship they maintain with each other as a strength in the IA declaration process. For example, both FEMA regional officials and state emergency management officials stated that they have a good working relationship and are in regular communication via telephone or in-person meetings with each other. Also, state emergency management officials we spoke to stated that whenever they are in need of assistance, they know they can reach out to FEMA regional officials for assistance. However, FEMA regional and state emergency management officials we spoke to also reported various challenges with the process. These include the subjective nature of the IA regulatory factors given the lack of eligibility thresholds, the lack of transparency in the decision-making process, and difficulty gathering information on IA regulatory factors. Subjective nature of the IA factors and lack of eligibility thresholds. Officials from 9 of 10 FEMA regions stated the subjective nature of the IA program is a challenge; and officials in 6 of the 10 regions also said they found the lack of eligibility thresholds a challenge. An official in one region stated that unlike FEMA’s Public Assistance program, which has minimum thresholds for eligibility, it is unclear when states should apply for IA funds. Under the Public Assistance program, for example, for states or tribes to qualify for assistance, they must demonstrate that they have sustained a minimum of $1 million in damages and the impact of damages must amount to $1.00 per capita in the state. An official in another region explained that although the subjectivity of the IA factors provides flexibility in determining the type of IA program needed, having some quantifiable criteria could help officials explain to states why their requests were denied or approved. Similarly, officials we interviewed in 7 of the 11 states said they found the subjective nature of the factors with no threshold to be a challenge. A state emergency management official in one state said this subjectivity makes it difficult to determine whether or not the state should make an IA request. A state emergency management official in another state reported that the subjectivity can cause the IA declaration process to be inconsistent, and it is not always clear how or why certain declarations were approved and others were not. Further, a state emergency management official in an additional state also pointed to the subjective nature of the factors with no threshold as a reason for not being able to provide a more detailed rationale behind a declaration denial. To illustrate this, table 7 shows how four states requested IA declarations related to the same tornado in 2012 and varied in what they reported across the six IA factors, such as the levels of damages incurred, special populations among their residents, and insurance coverage. Two of these four states—Kentucky and Indiana—received IA declarations and the other two—Ohio and Illinois—were denied. Lack of transparency. Another challenge reported by FEMA regional and state emergency management officials was the lack of transparency in how FEMA evaluates and provides a recommendation to the President on whether a declaration is warranted. For example, officials we interviewed in 4 of 10 regions indicated the lack of transparency as a challenge. A FEMA official in one region stated that the region would like more transparency regarding what FEMA headquarters recommends to the President and whether the President’s decision aligns with FEMA’s recommendation. State emergency management officials we interviewed in 10 of 11 states also reported that lack of transparency with the IA process is a challenge. For example, an emergency management official in one state said it is not clear how or if FEMA considers all of the factors. Also, an emergency management official in another state reported that it was unclear to him why his state’s declaration request was denied while the requests of other states with similar incidents were declared. Difficulty gathering information on IA regulatory factors. Officials in 4 of 10 FEMA regions reported difficulty gathering information, such as income or insurance coverage, as a challenge. An official in one region stated that it is difficult to obtain information related to IA factors from states. For example, the official said that calculating the concentration of damages is difficult absent technical guidance from FEMA headquarters, as the current guidance only accounts for the number of structure damage but not the impact of damage. Further, officials in two FEMA regions stated that states lack a dedicated IA official, making it difficult for state officials, who play multiple roles, to provide the necessary information related to the IA factors in their IA declaration request. Additionally, a state emergency management official in one state also reported that lack of staff resources in her state makes it difficult to verify all the local damage assessments prior to making a declaration request. Pursuant to the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, in November 2015, FEMA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise the six current IA regulatory factors to the following proposed factors: state fiscal capacity and resource availability; uninsured home and personal property losses; disaster-impacted population profile; impact to community infrastructure; casualties; and disaster-related unemployment. According to FEMA headquarters officials, the revisions aim to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed the declaration. The officials said the proposed rule also seeks to provide additional clarity and guidance for all the established factors. Table 8 shows FEMA’s description of current and proposed IA factors. FEMA received public comments from 14 states in the Federal Register during the comment period for the proposed rule and proposed guidance. The 14 states expressed concern about the proposed factor for state fiscal capacity and resource availability, including the reliability and relevance of data sources such as total taxable resources. These states expressed concern that the data collection necessary to meet the new requirements would fall upon them, adding to the cost burden of completing an IA disaster declaration request. They also explained that the use of total taxable resources and other similar data is not an effective way to assess a state’s current ability to provide resources following a disaster. Also, these states indicated that the data points such as total taxable resources and per capita personal income that would be used to evaluate state fiscal capacity are outdated and inaccurate and would be an inefficient way to evaluate a state’s true fiscal capacity to respond to a disaster. Regarding the other five proposed factors, several states in their comments raised questions about ambiguities in interpreting the factors or the feasibility and cost of gathering related data. For example, in regards to the factor on disaster impacted population, five states expressed concern that the data required for the disaster-impacted population factor would be a cost burden to the state or that the data would be inappropriate for evaluation. Additionally, two states said unemployment related to a disaster incident for the disaster-related unemployment factor would be hard to quantify in the first 30 days following a disaster. They stated that this was especially an issue given that states work to submit an IA disaster declaration request as soon as possible following a disaster. According to the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website, the projected date for finalization of the proposed rule is September 2018; however, as of April 2018, FEMA officials stated that they were not certain whether that timeframe would be met. Until the proposed rule is finalized, we will not know the extent to which the various challenges FEMA regions and state officials raised in our interviews and in comments on the proposed rule will be addressed. FEMA has obligated over $8.6 billion nationwide in IA from calendar years 2008 through 2016, highlighting the importance of FEMA’s evaluation of states’ and tribes’ IA declaration requests. FEMA’s regional offices evaluate the request and make a regional recommendation through the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation, which documents information on all relevant IA regulatory factors. FEMA has developed the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation to ensure regions consistently obtain and document the information needed by FEMA to make a disaster declaration recommendation to the President based on the IA regulatory factors. However, FEMA’s regional offices do not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the current IA regulatory factors. Because it is unclear why regions are not always documenting all of the elements related to these factors, evaluating the reasons why could help FEMA identify if any corrective steps are needed. Doing so could also help FEMA ensure it is meeting its stated goals in providing consistency in the evaluation process and in the types of factors it considers. We recommend that the Administrator of FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendations for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. We provided a draft of this report to DHS for its review and comment. DHS provided written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in full in appendix V. DHS concurred with the recommendation and described planned actions to address it. In addition, DHS provided written technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. DHS concurred with our recommendation that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendations for each element of the IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. DHS stated that a FEMA working group consisting of headquarters stakeholders will draft survey questions for FEMA region officials to identify the common reasons why an element of an IA regulatory factor may not be addressed within a RVAR. According to DHS, the working group will also analyze, assess, and present the findings of the survey responses to FEMA senior leadership, and if needed, FEMA will develop and send a memorandum to the regions with additional guidance regarding the appropriate preparation of RVARs. DHS stated that the estimated completion date is in the fall of 2018. These actions, if implemented effectively, should address the intent of our recommendation. We will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the FEMA Administrator, and the appropriate congressional committees.

Table 9 provides the total number of Individual Assistance declaration requests made, declared, and denied, by region, state, and tribe for disaster declarations requested from calendar years 2008 through 2016. Table 10 provides Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Individual Assistance (IA) actual obligations for declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016 by state and type of disaster. As part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) declaration process, FEMA’s regional offices are to evaluate states’ or tribes’ declaration requests, including the IA declaration request, and make a recommendation called the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation (RVAR) and submit the RVAR to FEMA headquarters. In June 2012, FEMA headquarters issued a template for FEMA regional offices to use in developing the RVAR as identified in figure 3. Tables 11 through 16 provide information on each element of the 6 Individual Assistance (IA) regulatory factors documented in the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation (RVAR) from July 2012 through December 2016 by the Federal Emergency Management Agency region. In addition to the contact named above, Aditi Archer (Assistant Director), Su Jin Yon (Analyst-In-Charge), Hiwotte Amare, Eric Hauswirth, Susan Hsu, Jun S. (Joyce) Kang, Christopher Keisling, Heidi Nielson, Hadley Nobles, Anne Rhodes-Kline, and Jerome (Jerry) Sandau made significant contributions to this report.", "answers": ["FEMA's IA program provides help to individuals to meet their immediate needs after a disaster, such as shelter and medical expenses. When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. DHS concurred with the recommendation."], "length": 5031, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e1c3cc7ce5dcbe10bb907e13bf9c2f669f27e5549a8a6f90"}
{"input": "", "context": "U.S. taxpayers who earn income abroad may be subject to U.S. taxes on that income. Firms incorporated in the United States can earn income from their own foreign activities or through their ownership of foreign subsidiaries. In such cases, income is subject to tax in both the country where it was earned and in the United States. In this report, we focus on U.S. corporations with operations in foreign countries. Countries have generally adopted one of two alternative approaches to taxing corporations’ foreign income. Prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97—commonly referred to by the President and many administrative documents as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)—the U.S. government taxed U.S. corporations largely on a worldwide basis, meaning that the United States taxed both the domestic and foreign earned income of corporations. Most other countries, including most OECD member countries, use a largely territorial approach that taxes income earned within their borders, and exempts certain foreign-earned income of their resident corporations from taxation. However, under both a worldwide and a territorial system, income earned by foreign entities from operations within a country is taxed by that country. As such, the corporation or its subsidiary must file a tax return in that country, and the country’s tax authority can audit the tax return and adjust taxable income and taxes due. Countries have adopted measures to limit the potential for double taxation, which occurs when two or more countries levy taxes on the same income due to differences in the tax jurisdictions and tax systems. To avoid double taxation, countries—including the United States—that tax on a worldwide basis provide a credit for foreign taxes paid that reduces the MNC’s domestic tax liability. In addition, countries maintain tax treaties with each other that cover a wide range of tax issues but have two primary purposes: (1) avoiding double taxation, and (2) preventing tax evasion. Despite these efforts to limit disputes, a U.S. MNC may disagree with an adjustment made to its taxable income. In such cases, an MNC can go directly to the country’s tax authority to try to resolve the dispute. According to tax experts we spoke with, if, however, a U.S. MNC views this process as unlikely to be successful or if it was unsuccessful and believes the adjustment would result in double taxation, the corporation can ask USCA for assistance in resolving the dispute. In the United States, the designated USCA is the commissioner of the Large Business and International Division of the IRS. The USCA office is made up of two groups: the Advance Pricing and Mutual Agreement Program (APMA) and the Treaty Assistance and Interpretation Team. According to USCA officials, most disputes involving U.S. MNCs—the focus of this report—are resolved through APMA. TJCA significantly changed the way in which the United States taxes MNC’s income but some experts have pointed out that the law is unlikely to end profit shifting. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in April 2018 that TCJA would reduce profit shifting by about $65 billion per year out of an estimated $300 billion of profit shifting per year prior to the act. For U.S. corporations earning income directly through foreign subsidiaries, the act moved the United States from a system that generally taxed worldwide income and provided a credit for taxes paid abroad to a system that generally does not tax foreign-sourced income. However, the new ‘territorial’ system created by the act included a number of provisions designed to protect the United States’ corporate tax base by taxing some foreign income. It included (1) a lower worldwide tax on global intangible low-taxed income, and (2) a corresponding tax on intangible income earned abroad based on assets in the United States (foreign-derived intangible income). The act also added a corporate tax base erosion and antiabuse tax. It is not clear how these provisions will affect corporations’ allocation of profits and business activity. The process of resolving a dispute through MAP usually begins when a U.S. MNC requests assistance from USCA to resolve disputes over an adjustment in either its foreign-filed or its U.S. tax return. According to IRS, the number of active MAP cases, as of October 2017, was 686 and covered $26 billion of income subject to potential double taxation. It should be noted that a single U.S. taxpayer can be involved in multiple MAP cases because disputes are resolved bi-laterally. For example, if a U.S. MNC had a dispute involving the allocation of overhead costs across multiple subsidiaries in different countries, then there would be separate dispute cases for each country involved. According to IRS data, the number of MAP cases filed each year has been growing, more than doubling in 5 years from 100 in 2010 to 286 in 2014. As noted earlier, when a U.S. MNC disputes a foreign tax authority’s adjustment to a tax return, the U.S. MNC can try to resolve the issue through the appeals process within the taxing jurisdiction. However, according to tax experts we spoke with, if the U.S. MNC is unsuccessful or if the U.S. MNC believes the local appeal will be less successful than the MAP process, it can request assistance from USCA. Once a taxpayer has requested assistance through MAP, USCA conducts an initial review to determine if it will accept the request. For example, USCA analysts would ensure that the request involves potential double taxation and that the foreign country was a treaty partner. If USCA accepts the MAP request for assistance, it reviews the technical facts of the dispute and prepares its position prior to negotiating on a resolution with the foreign competent authority. When IRS, rather than the foreign tax authority, initiates the adjustment, USCA will discuss the facts of the case with the IRS examiner who proposed the adjustment, but determines on its own how much of the adjustment is justified. In the case of foreign-initiated adjustments, USCA will contact the foreign competent authority while developing its position to provide updates and obtain any needed information. According to USCA officials, based on its review, the USCA determines whether it considers the adjustment valid and the amount of the adjustment that should be withdrawn by the initiating tax authority, and what amount of relief USCA may provide. USCA can also unilaterally decide to fully withdraw the IRS adjustment or provide full correlative relief for a foreign-initiated adjustment that USCA considers valid. USCA resolves disputes brought to it by MNCs according to MAP specified in the tax treaties. Under the treaties, international tax disputes that may result in double taxation can be resolved in the following five ways: The country that initiated the adjustment to taxable income can fully withdraw the adjustment, leaving the taxpayer’s reportable taxable income unchanged. USCA can provide correlative relief to the MNC. This relief usually takes the form of a corresponding adjustment, which relieves double taxation caused by the other country’s adjustment. USCA and the foreign country can agree to a combination of withdrawing some of the adjustment to taxable income and providing relief for the remaining adjustment to provide full relief of double taxation to the taxpayer. USCA and the foreign country can agree on some combination of withdrawal and relief that results in partial relief to the taxpayer. No relief from adjustment. Figure 1 provides an overview of the basic process of a MAP request for assistance. Appendix III provides illustrative examples of dispute resolution cases and resolutions. Once USCA has determined its position, it begins negotiating with the foreign competent authority to resolve the dispute. These cases can take several years to resolve with some taking much longer than the average, particularly if there is a fundamental disagreement. For example, USCA’s APMA inventory data from 2013 to 2017 indicate the average processing time was around 2 years, but cases ranged from as little as a few months to 5 years to resolve, with a few cases taking even longer. In addition, the inventory data show that disputes are generally over taxable income from prior years. For example, a MAP case resolved in 2017 could have been filed in 2008 for a dispute over 2005 taxable income. However, cases may be shorter when the tax treaties include provisions for binding arbitration. The United States has treaties with four counties that include provisions for binding arbitration. If the two countries are unable to resolve the dispute within 2 years, the taxpayer can request that the case go to arbitration for a decision. Throughout the entire process, the taxpayer has a right to withdraw the request and accept the tax authority’s adjustment which may entail double taxation. According to tax experts that we interviewed, if the adjustment is small, a taxpayer may prefer to accept the double taxation rather than incur the cost of going through the MAP process. These costs can include direct costs of retaining tax advisors as well as the indirect costs of listing the amount of funds that are in dispute on their financial statement as an unresolved tax issue. The taxpayer can also refuse the negotiated or arbitrated resolution and appeal the case to the IRS office of appeals or foreign tax authority. USCA provides information about the MAP process through an IRS web page on competent authority assistance. The webpage includes contact information for USCA offices and a link to a document that describes the process for requesting assistance. The document is in the form of a Revenue Procedure—an official statement of a procedure based on the Internal Revenue Code, related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations. Our analysis of the information on the website found a number of issues that limit its accessibility: The website does not include an overview or high-level description of the MAP process. The website lacked elements such as frequently asked questions or fact sheets that IRS has developed for similar processes that help promote understanding of complex tax issues. The website does not explain in clear language what constitutes a tax dispute eligible for the MAP resolution process. Other IRS websites provide more detailed information for other issues relevant to U.S. MNCs. For example, the IRS website for country-by-country reporting provides a detailed page explaining the new reporting guidance with multiple links for additional guidance. In addition, USCA’s guidance for requesting MAP assistance is an 87- page revenue procedure. While this document is complete, it is highly technical and may not be easily understood by taxpayers seeking relief from double taxation. IRS requires information for taxpayers to be clear and accessible. IRS’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights states that taxpayers have the right to clear explanations of tax laws and IRS procedures. In addition, the federal internal control standards, the Plain Writing Act of 2010, and Office of Management and Budget plain writing guidance state that agencies should, for example, communicate the necessary quality information externally. Moreover, accessibility is consistent with the criteria we have previously identified for a good tax system. IRS’s Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022 notes that the agency faces a business environment that is becoming more global, dynamic, and digital, further underscoring the importance of taxpayers having accessible, plain language guidance on MAP. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also assessed the accessibility of USCA’s guidance and found that it met OECD’s minimum standards. As part of its base erosion and profit-shifting project, the OECD has been reviewing countries’ administrations of the mutual agreement processes. In its review of the United States’ process, the OECD concluded that while U.S. MAP guidance is comprehensive and available, and fully met the OECD’s minimum standards, some further clarity could be provided. The OECD review offered examples of how other countries provide taxpayers with overview information they can use before accessing more detailed technical guidance. For example, Canada publishes an annual MAP Program Report on its website that includes background information on its process, as well as general information on the steps in the process and high-level information on timeframes. Singapore’s MAP web page includes basic information on the MAP process, an example of a case that would be suitable for MAP, and a link for users to provide feedback on the usefulness of the information. USCA officials said that they have not improved the information provided on their website because they believe the current guidance to be sufficient. However, USCA officials told us that they are engaged in some efforts that may improve the information they provide to taxpayers. USCA officials stated that USCA is close to finalizing a “practice unit” explaining the competent authority process. According to USCA officials, this unit uses plain language to walk taxpayers step by step through MAP and the competent authority process. The unit also highlights the roles and responsibilities of all the stakeholders in the process, including the taxpayers. USCA officials said they intend to make the practice unit available on USCA’s public website and the United States’ OECD MAP Profile. APMA officials also said they expect that the additional information on the requirements of MAP and Revenue Procedure 2015-40 will be useful to those unfamiliar with the processes. USCA officials did not provide a date for when this practice unit would be completed. Providing taxpayers with a clear overview and accessible guidance on the MAP process would help ensure that taxpayers who might benefit from entering the MAP process are aware of the process, know how to navigate it, and understand the general time frames for relief. Providing information that helps facilitate this process could help reduce taxpayer burden. USCA may contact taxpayers about their cases for various reasons. Officials in the APMA office stated that they send acknowledgement letters when the MAP request is accepted, and routinely gather additional information from taxpayers to fully develop a MAP case. They said that an analyst generally will communicate with a taxpayer before and after APMA has substantive discussions with its foreign counterparts regarding the taxpayer’s case. While officials stated they provide regular contact, they do not have a process to systematically record or track these contacts, other than in the case file. Regular contact with taxpayers may help make the process more transparent and help ensure that they are informed about their cases. One of the criteria we have previously identified for a good tax system is transparency. A transparent tax system reduces uncertainty for taxpayers, allowing them to better plan their decisions about employment and investment. According to IRS officials, APMA provides general guidance on when a taxpayer should be notified of developments in the case or its status. APMA officials stated that contact will vary depending on the facts and circumstances of the case such as its complexity and frequency of communications with the foreign competent authority. However, the guidance is focused on taxpayer expectations and does not address any requirements of officials to track or record contacts. Contacts with taxpayers could affect perceptions of the transparency and fairness of the MAP process. Tracking and recording contact with taxpayers would help provide APMA with assurance that taxpayers are being kept aware of the status of their MAP case in a timely manner. Monitoring such information would help APMA to evaluate the transparency and fairness of its MAP administration. It would also help assure APMA there is consistency in contacting taxpayers. APMA maintains an inventory database that tracks some information on MAP cases. These data include how many months it took to resolve the case, the analyst assigned to the case, and whether an economist was assigned. According to APMA officials, each MAP case is assigned an analyst and, for complex cases, an economist. APMA groups analysts into teams that work on MAP cases from different geographic regions. Three teams consist of economists that are assigned to cases managed by other teams. APMA data on how staff are deployed are shown in table 1. While these data provide some information on workload, they do not provide information on how many hours or staff days are associated with a particular case. This information would be useful to know because it could provide insight about the resources needed for different cases based on differences in complexity and other factors. Standards for internal control state that management should establish and operate monitoring activities that can be used to evaluate results and ensure that objectives are met with minimum wasted resources. However, according to APMA officials, their tracking system is not set up to track hours or staff days spent on each case. Instead, according to APMA officials, their staffing process accounts for differences in complexity in other ways. Officials explained that when APMA receives a MAP request, it ranks the request according to complexity using a scale that runs from 1 to 5. The more complex cases, those ranked 3 or higher, are assigned an economist which can increase the cost of working the more complex cases. In our review of a generalizable sample of MAP case files we found a number of inconsistencies between the amount of adjustment recorded in APMA’s inventory database, the amount recorded in the original MAP request, and the amount recorded in the resolution letter provided to taxpayers and the foreign competent authority. We also found inconsistencies between the request letter and the resolution letter amounts. On the basis of our sample, we estimate that about 30 percent of the entries in the inventory database had these types of discrepancies. The cause of some of these discrepancies was relatively easy to identify and correct, such as transcription errors, which could have been detected if APMA had a more robust inventory management system in place. Other inconsistencies in the data were more difficult to resolve. According to IRS officials, some discrepancies could be explained by changes in exchange rates over time. However other inconsistencies could be not be as easily explained. These inconsistencies exist because APMA does not have controls in place to systematically and routinely evaluate the quality of the data in its inventory of cases. As a result, the accuracy of program measures that USCA might develop based on these data may be uncertain. Having controls in place to ensure the accuracy of data in the inventory database would also help APMA meet OECD’s minimum standards. The OECD has called for countries to provide MAP case statistics by country and published these statistics for the first time in 2018. According to APMA officials, APMA is currently working on implementing an upgraded inventory management system that should help APMA meet this goal. Development and full implementation of this project has been underway for 4 years. APMA’s inventory data-base includes data on both pending and resolved MAP cases that can help management monitor program operations and potentially identify areas to improve the management of MAP cases. However, APMA does not systematically analyze data to identify areas for improvement. For example, analysis of trends and comparisons of certain case characteristics—such as the country initiating the adjustment, the elapsed time on the case, whether an economist was assigned to the case, and the negotiated outcome—can help to identify how these characteristics may be related. According to APMA officials they do not undertake this kind of data analysis because they use the data as needed to manage current resources and to achieve their primary goal of satisfying the OECD’s minimum standards. These minimum standards include such goals as countries ensuring that adequate resources are provided to the MAP function and ensuring that both competent authorities should be made aware of MAP requests and given an opportunity to share their views on whether the request should be accepted. According to federal internal control standards, management should design information systems to provide information to meet the entity’s objectives and respond to risks. Information and analysis that helps APMA understand changes in international environment and complexity of U.S. MNCs would better enable it to identify future resource needs by evaluating trends in case characteristics. In the absence of quantifiable analysis conducted by APMA, we used information from its existing inventory data to illustrate the types of analysis that may be possible. For example, figure 2 shows that the volume of cases can vary greatly by country over time. The figure shows that the number of cases resulting from an adjustment by IRS ranged from a low of 22 in 2015 to high of 85 in 2017. Conducting similar analysis of trends in volume may help APMA better plan for allocating its limited resources to different teams in anticipation of increased case volume. In addition, because APMA allocates staff across teams that focus on particular countries, tracking trends in case load by country could help USCA prepare to anticipate spikes in cases and allocate resources more effectively across country teams. By conducting regular trend analyses, APMA could also identify areas for further analysis to determine what may be driving variations in case load by country. Similarly, figure 3 shows our analysis of the average time to resolve a case. Average case time ranged between 15 and 40 months, with the average case time exceeding the OECD-recommended 24-month period for a number of countries and years. By conducting similar analysis of the trends and differences in processing time across MAP cases, APMA would be better able to identify areas meriting additional review for ways to improve timeliness. We also used inventory data to analyze outcomes in terms of the determinations reached through MAP negotiations. One analysis included an examination of the share of cases in which the United States provided some relief to the taxpayer. As can be seen in figure 4, most foreign cases in most years resulted in relief being shared between the two countries involved in a dispute. As shown in figure 4, in 2017, approximately two-thirds of all foreign cases were resolved with both countries providing some relief compared to less than 10 percent of U.S. cases. However, as shown in figure 5, USCA in most years fully withdrew a large percentage of adjustments made by IRS. In 2017, 74 percent of IRS adjustments were withdrawn. The data show that U.S.-initiated cases were more often resolved entirely by the United States than with the foreign country providing some of the relief. However, these data on case resolutions need to be interpreted with caution. For example, as pointed out by IRS officials, a measure like the percent withdrawn may be misinterpreted if it concerns a small number of large MNCs with operations in many countries, and the adjustments are small unless this information is provided as context. Nonetheless, the case resolution data can be useful for guiding further analysis by helping to identify areas that would merit further analysis of the reasons for withdrawing cases or the reasons IRS examiners are making adjustments that are not upheld by USCA. Analyzing trends in outcomes would help to ensure that APMA is not missing opportunities to protect the U.S. corporate tax base and that IRS examiners are cognizant of tax treaty treatment of foreign source income of U.S. MNCs. Additional examples of MAP case data analysis are provided in appendix IV. While APMA must work all MAP cases, developing quality data on MAP cases would help to ensure effective management of the program. Analyzing trends in case data could help identify and manage evolving demands and priorities—such as the challenges present in a changing global tax environment. According to federal internal control standards, as a part of management controls, management should design information systems to obtain and process information to meet operational needs. Because APMA cannot alter its workload, it is all the more important to effectively manage staff and time. Reliable information systems are essential for effective management. Without assessing APMAs’ current and past performance, APMA may be less able to identify areas for improvement. Conducting analysis and improving the quality of data could help inform APMA’s allocation of resources and inform other parts of the agency concerning international tax issues. For example, IRS exams may be better able to judge the appropriateness of its tax adjustments when it is informed about how USCA has viewed similar adjustments governed by tax treaties. The APMA inventory database contains select characteristics of resolved cases, such as the time it took to resolve the case and the country that initiated the adjustment in dispute. However, it does not contain information on the tax issue that was in dispute. Without tracking the tax issue in dispute, APMA is unable to analyze trends in tax issues which could be used to determine if there are systemic issues that could be solved through means such as changes in IRS regulations, treaty, or statute. USCA officials told us that there are additional costs to tracking tax issues and that defining the type of tax issue involved in complex international tax cases could be difficult. However, IRS tracks issues in other similar areas. For example, IRS’s Office of Appeals, which handles a wide range of tax controversies covering both international and domestic issues, tracks the tax issue in dispute. Furthermore, APMA includes categories of tax transactions in its annual statutory reports. The categories are used in Advanced Pricing Agreements (APA) to distinguish between a U.S. entity and non-U.S. entity, and to determine whether a transaction covered by an agreement involved the sale of tangible property, use of intangible property or the provision of services. APAs are agreements between IRS and MNCs on how transactions among related entities of the MNC should be priced. APAs can prevent potential disputes by having agreement on the transaction prior to filing a tax return with IRS. These categories or alternative categories that APMA has already developed could be added to the inventory database to provide additional information on the tax issue in dispute. To illustrate how the additional information on tax issues can help inform management decisions, we categorized the tax issues in our sample of MAP cases using APA categories. As shown in figures 6 and 7, we compared the estimated percentage of certain tax issues in all MAP cases between 2015 and 2017 with those in APA cases in 2014. We also compared tax issues with other characteristics of the MAP cases. As figure 6 shows, an estimated 37 percent of MAP cases involved disputes over a tax adjustment related to services provided by a non-US entity such as a foreign corporation. Figure 6 also shows that disputes concerning the provision of services (both U.S. and non-U.S.) are estimated to account for 61 percent of cases, which far exceeded disputes over the use of intangible property, at 17 percent or the sale of tangible property at 15 percent. Conducting similar reviews of this type of information could help APMA better match its resources in terms of experience with different types of tax issues. We also compared tax issues identified in MAP cases with the transactions covered in APAs. The results illustrate how tracking tax issues could be useful for improving the administration of both programs. For example, as shown in figure 7, 23 percent of APA transactions covered sales of tangible property into the United States in 2014. Our categorization of MAP cases reported in figure 6 shows sales of tangible property into the United States as a disputed issue in only an estimated 8 percent of those cases. This difference in relative frequencies may suggest a connection between the programs, as tax practitioners have suggested increasing the use of APAs as a way of reducing international tax disputes. However, some of the differences in percentages between figure 6 and 7 could arise from differences in years covered and in categorization of tax issues. We also categorized the information to illustrate how tracking tax issues and other characteristics, such as location and the outcomes of the dispute resolution process could help with administration. For example, as shown in table 2, the tax issue with the largest estimated share of foreign MAP cases (67 percent) involved the provision of services. U.S. MAP cases, in contrast, were spread more evenly across tax issues, with no single tax category having an estimated share greater than 50 percent. Conducting a similar review of this type of information could help APMA match its resource allocations in terms of staff experience with different types of tax issues within its country-focused teams. Additionally, table 3 shows when we tracked outcomes of the dispute resolution process, we found that an estimated 69 percent of cases resolved by a combination of withdrawal and correlative relief involved the provision of services. For other outcomes, this tax issue of provision of services is estimated to occur 49 percent of the time. Further research on how outcomes and tax issues may be related could also inform how APMA trains and assigns staff. Other analyses could examine the tax issue and whether an economist was assigned or the average processing time. These statistics may help identify insights into complex cases. Undertaking similar reviews across tax issues may help identify areas for increased scrutiny to ensure effective administration. Federal internal controls standards state that as part of an effective internal control system, management should establish activities to monitor program performance. Reliable information on program operations requires the collection of quality data. Collecting key characteristics and conducting relevant analyses would help ensure effective internal control and could help improve USCA’s management of MAP cases. In a world with a growing number of international transactions, the United States needs an efficient and effective dispute resolution process to ensure that it is protecting the U.S. taxpayer and the U.S. corporate tax base. The MAP processes adopted by countries—including the United States—in their tax treaties are in place to prevent double taxation and ensure the accurate application of treaty provisions. USCA plays a key role in resolving disputes over double taxation but the agency has weaknesses in its processes that hamper its efforts. First, USCA has not provided clear guidance to taxpayers on how the MAP process works. As a result, taxpayers may be unaware of the process and not fully understand what to expect when they undergo it. Furthermore, USCA does not record when and for what reason there is contact between the taxpayer and USCA, therefore making it difficult for USCA to ensure that taxpayers are informed about the progress of their case. Second, USCA does not track the hours that analysts spend on cases and the milestones of cases. As a result, USCA does not have a full understanding of the efficiency of the MAP process, including ways to improve it. It also does not have processes to ensure the quality of the data it collects, therefore cannot ensure accurate performance measurement. While APMA aims to meet the minimum standards of the OECD, it does not analyze the data to identify areas for improvement. Analyses of USCA’s data could more fully inform its management decisions. A number of potential analyses are available of how cases are resolved. By forgoing these types of analyses, USCA may be unaware of certain trends, possible explanations for them, or any need to adjust guidance or resources to address these issues. Finally, many of APMA’s tasks depend on factors beyond its control (for example, the volume of taxpayer requests), but management of the processes could benefit from the collection and analysis of well-defined measures and quality data. We are making the following eight recommendations to the IRS. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to provide an overview of the MAP process that is more accessible and transparent than the Revenue Procedure. (Recommendation 1) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to ensure that APMA staff record and track contact with taxpayers. (Recommendation 2) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to ensure that APMA staff record and track the hours they spend on MAP cases. (Recommendation 3) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to ensure that APMA identify and record the dates of key milestones throughout MAP case resolutions. (Recommendation 4) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to ensure that APMA puts procedures in place to review the quality of inventory data. (Recommendation 5) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to ensure that APMA records the dollar amounts of MAP case outcomes in its database. (Recommendation 6) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to ensure that APMA analyzes trends in case characteristics as part of routine program management activities. (Recommendation 7) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should direct USCA to ensure that APMA identify and record categories of the tax issue relevant in the dispute. (Recommendation 8) We provided a draft of this report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for review and comment. In its written comments, reprinted in appendix II, IRS agreed with our eight recommendations and will provide detailed corrective action plans in its 60-day letter response to Congress. IRS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and other interested parties.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. As noted earlier, to assess the extent to which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) evaluates management of dispute resolution cases, we interview IRS officials. Having determined that the Advanced Pricing Mutual Agreement Program (APMA) does not conduct analysis of mutual agreement procedure (MAP) case data, we used information from its existing inventory data to illustrate the types of analysis that may be possible. The inventory database APMA provided us contained all MAP cases that were closed from 2013 to 2017, as well as the current stock of open MAP cases. Because of a change in the method of recording the outcome variable between 2013 and 2014, we restricted our analysis of outcomes to 2014 to 2017. The inventory database did not include a variable for the tax issue in dispute. To illustrate the type of analysis that could be conducted if the tax issue were recorded we collected a sample of MAP case files. To estimate features such as tax issue and outcome for the inventory database, we selected a generalizable random sample of 84 cases that was proportionally allocated across four strata described in table 4. The strata included wither the initiating country was U.S. or Non-U.S. and whether an Economist was involved. This sample was selected from the population frame that consists of all files from APMA 2013-2017 Resolved and 2017 Pending inventory for cases resolved in years 2015 to 2017. Overall, this sample was designed to produce 95 percent confidence intervals for percentage estimates that are within approximately +/- 10 percentage points. The sample is not designed to provide estimates for other reporting groups at the same level of precision, and all margins of error are reported along with estimates. To create a tax issue variable, we reviewed the summary of competent authority issues required by Rev.Proc. 2015-40 to be included in the MAP request letter. We then allocated the tax issue described in the narrative to APMA’s advanced pricing agreement transaction categories. Some case files included multiple tax issues, but these cases accounted for less than 18 percent of the sample. The illustrations provided rely on the first tax issue noted in the narrative. Table 5 provides the estimates and margins of error for the categories. The following tables illustrate how a resolution can be reached in different types of disputes. Table 6 provides a hypothetical example of U.S.- initiated adjustment to a transfer price and a resolution that provides full relief from double taxation through a combination of partial withdrawal and correlative relief. In this example, the U.S. multinational corporation (MNC) parent sells a product to its subsidiary incorporated in a foreign country for $1,000. The U.S. parent is taxed on the income of $1,000 from the sale and the subsidiary is able to deduct that payment. The U.S. tax authority audits the parent’s return and determines that the price the parent sold the product for was too low and adjusts to price up from $1,000 to $2,000, resulting in an increase in taxable income. The U.S. MNC parent disputes the adjustment and requests assistance from the U.S. Competent Authority (USCA). The new adjusted transfer price results in $1,000 that is subject to double taxation because the foreign subsidiary has not deducted the additional $1,000 as the price paid to the U.S. parent, while the U.S. tax authority is now considering that income taxable. USCA negotiates with the foreign competent authority and the two parties agree on a revised transfer price of $1,600. The negotiated resolution results in USCA agreeing to withdraw $400 of the original adjusted amount of the transfer price. In turn, the foreign competent authority agrees to correlative relief in the form of an increased deduction of $600 of the additional price that the foreign subsidiary will pay the U.S. parent. The taxpayer receives full relief from double taxation since the total of the withdrawal and the correlative relief erases the $1,000 of double-taxed income that resulted from the increased adjustment. Alternatively, foreign tax authorities can make adjustments that affect a U.S. taxpayer. Table 7 provides a hypothetical example of a foreign initiated adjustment to a cost-sharing arrangement, and a resolution that provides full relief from double taxation, again, through a combination of partial withdrawal and correlative relief. In this scenario, the U.S. parent and its foreign subsidiary agree to share the costs of developing a product that will yield income of $10,000. As part of the agreement, the subsidiary will receive 10 percent of the income yield while the parent will receive 90 percent. The foreign tax authority audits the subsidiary’s tax return and determines that the amount of income assigned to the subsidiary is too low. It then adjusts the percentage to 50 percent, increasing the income allocated to the subsidiary from $1,000 to $5,000. This adjustment results in a potential $4,000 of income that is now subject to double taxation. The subsidiary decides that resolving this dispute locally is unlikely and through the U.S. parent requests assistance from USCA. USCA and the foreign competent authority negotiate a new allocation of 35 percent resulting in new income allocated to the subsidiary of $3,500. This resolution results in a combination of withdrawal and correlative relief. The competent authority agrees to withdraw $1,500 of the adjustment as income to the subsidiary, and the U.S. competent authority agrees to reduce the amount taxable to the parent by $2,500. The taxpayer receives full relief from double taxation since the total of the withdrawal and the correlative relief erases the $4,000 of double-taxed income that resulted from the increased adjustment. All mutual agreement procedure (MAP) cases are not the same in terms of complexity. One possible indicator of complexity is whether an economist was assigned to a case. United States Competent Authority (USCA) ranks the cases in order of complexity and assigns economists to the more complex cases. Our analysis of Advanced Pricing and Mutual Agreement Program (APMA) data in figure 8 shows how the use of economists varies by source of MAP cases. For most years, APMA assigned economists to a higher percentage of cases that involved U.S. than Canadian initiated adjustments. For most years, the share of economists assigned to foreign initiated cases was similar to U.S. initiated cases. However, in 2015 and 2016 the share of U.S. cases receiving an economist was more than double that of all foreign initiated cases. For most years, an economist was assigned to less than a quarter of foreign and U.S. MAP cases. We also analyzed USCA inventory data to compare the percentage of cases that were assigned an economist and the average time it took to resolve cases. As figure 9 shows, the average time a case was in processing tends to decrease when the percentage of cases that are assigned an economist increases. This relationship suggests that assigning economists to a case may reduce the time it takes to resolve it despite the greater complexity of the case. However, there may be many other factors that could influence processing time. APMA officials noted that many these factors include the readiness of the foreign competent authority to discuss the case in a timely fashion. Further analysis would be necessary to isolate the effects of specific resource allocation changes on process efficiency.

Stephens made significant contributions to this report.", "answers": ["With increasing globalization, multinational corporations can take advantage of differences in countries' corporate tax systems to reduce their overall tax liabilities. However, globalization can also lead to disputes about the correct tax liability for U.S. MNCs in different countries. GAO was asked to review how the United States administers the process for resolving international tax disputes when a U.S. MNC disagrees with a tax determination of another country. This report (1) describes IRS's dispute resolution process, (2) assesses the information IRS provides to taxpayers about the process, and (3) assesses the extent to which IRS evaluates its management of dispute resolutions cases. GAO reviewed IRS guidance on the MAP process, interviewed IRS officials and compared IRS actions to federal standards for internal control and GAO's criteria for a good tax system. GAO analyzed MAP data for cases closed from 2013 to 2017 as well as a stratified random sample of MAP case files. A U.S. multinational corporation (MNC) operating in a foreign country is subject to taxes in that country as well as in the United States. The U.S. MNC's tax return may be audited by the United States or the other country. Such audits can result in an adjustment to the U.S. MNC's taxable income that may result in income being subject to tax in both countries. If the U.S. MNC disagrees with the adjustment, it can ask the United States Competent Authority (USCA) within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to help resolve the dispute through the mutual agreement procedure (MAP). Generally, disputes are resolved by one country withdrawing some or all of the adjustment and the other country providing other relief to the MNC to address double taxation of income. The following figure provides an overview of the dispute resolution process. Dispute resolution assistance is available to U.S.MNCs that need it and USCA provides comprehensive technical information on its website on how to request assistance. However, because USCA's website does not provide an overview or plain language guidance on the MAP process U.S. MNCs may not have clear information on how to navigate the process. USCA has taken a number of steps to ensure efficient management of MAP cases including assigning staff with requisite background and skills to cases according to their complexity and organizing staff into teams that specialize by countries. However, GAO identified a number of weaknesses that impact USCA's management of MAP cases. These include the following key data are not tracked and existing data are not used to assess the effective allocation of resources for the program, few controls have been established to monitor and ensure the reliability of the data in the case management database, and lack of trend analyses on dispute case characteristics that could help inform management decision making and the more efficient operation of the program. GAO is making a total of eight recommendations, including that IRS improve the clarity of information on the dispute resolution process, track and use dispute resolution case data, ensure the quality of case data, and analyze trends in dispute case characteristics. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations and said it will provide detailed corrective action plans."], "length": 7350, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d29b6ac32a7607a085562f87143a9bad41b7f2338a81a2c5"}
{"input": "", "context": "Radiological material is used throughout the world for medical and industrial purposes. Possession of this material within the United States requires a license from NRC or from one of the 37 Agreement States to which NRC has relinquished regulatory responsibility. NRC and Agreement States issue two types of licenses authorizing the possession and use of radiological materials: specific licenses and general licenses. Specific licenses are issued for devices that typically contain larger quantities of radiological material, such as medical equipment used to treat cancer, cameras used for industrial radiography, and moisture and density gauges used in construction. Devices approved for use under a general license, by contrast, such as luminous exit signs, normally contain relatively small quantities of radiological material. Such devices are designed with inherent safety features, are widely available commercially, and do not require NRC or Agreement State approval to possess. Not all radiological material requires an NRC license for possession. For example, there is naturally occurring radioactive material in ceramics, fertilizers, and granite tile that does not require a license. This report focuses on radiological material that requires specific licenses for possession and use. Beyond requiring specific licenses for possession of radiological material, NRC may also require a general or specific license to import such material. Generally, NRC will issue an import license when the recipient of the material is authorized to receive and possess the material being imported. When issuing licenses for the possession of radiological material, NRC and Agreement States take steps to ensure companies are legitimate. Specifically, NRC and Agreement State officials are to conduct pre- licensing visits with all unknown applicants, using detailed screening criteria. According to NRC, the purpose of the site visit is to have a face- to-face meeting with the applicant to determine whether there is a basis for confidence that the applicant will use the radiological materials sought as represented in the application when the applicant receives the license. NRC has established a 14-point checklist to guide pre-licensing site visits and has developed a list of questions and activities related to each applicant’s business operations, facility, radiation safety operations, and personnel qualifications, to scrutinize the applicant and provide a basis for confidence that the applicant will use the radiological material as specified in the license. In 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency published a system— which NRC adopted in 2004—that ranks quantities of individual radionuclides into one of five categories on the basis of their potential to harm human health. Under this system, a given radionuclide is considered dangerous when gathered in sufficient quantity and in close enough proximity to people to cause direct human health effects. A category 1 quantity, if not safely managed or securely protected, is likely to cause permanent injury to a person who handles or is otherwise in contact with it for more than a few minutes. Being close to this amount of unshielded material for a period of a few minutes to an hour will probably be fatal. A category 2 quantity, if not safely managed or securely protected, can cause permanent injury to a person who handles or is otherwise in contact with it for a short time (minutes to hours). Being close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of hours to days can be fatal. A category 3 quantity, if not safely managed or securely protected, can cause permanent injury to a person who handles or is otherwise in contact with it for some hours. Being close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of days to weeks can be fatal. Category 4 and 5 quantities are unlikely to cause permanent injury. In addition to categorizing radionuclides on the basis of their potential to harm human health, NRC has identified 16 radionuclides that are sufficiently attractive for use in a dirty bomb or for other malicious purposes. These 16 radionuclides of concern, shown in table 1, warrant enhanced security and protection measures—such as cameras, alarms, and other physical security measures—under NRC regulations. Radiological material is imported into the United States by both express consignment couriers arriving by air and air cargo carriers. Express consignment couriers, such as FedEx, move cargo for the public under express commercial services and provide door-to-door delivery. Air cargo carriers transport radiological material in cargo containers on commercial airlines. We have previously reported on the disparity in portal monitor deployment between the express consignment and air cargo environments. There are dozens of portal monitors in U.S. airports servicing express couriers, but few servicing air cargo carriers. According to CBP officials, handheld monitors are used to scan radioactive material at airports where portal monitors are not available. The CBP mission includes the border enforcement of the customs, immigration, and agriculture laws and regulations of the United States and enforcement on behalf of numerous federal agencies. The mission includes enforcement of the laws relating to the importation and exportation of merchandise into and out of the United States. In addition, the agency’s mission includes denying entry to terrorists and their weapons and criminals and their contraband. CBP’s Office of Field Operations is responsible for passenger and cargo processing activities related to border security, trade, immigration, and agricultural inspection at the nation’s air, sea, and land ports of entry. Prior to importing goods into the United States, information is submitted to CBP declaring the contents of shipments. This information includes, among other things, a description of goods, the name of the recipient, the port of entry, and a tariff code that classifies goods. CBP uses various data systems to track shipments into the United States and identify shipments for license verification. According to CBP, the Automated Commercial Environment is the primary system for processing shipments entering the United States, and it enables the government to make determinations about whether to admit goods into the country. The data stored in the Automated Commercial Environment are also used to ensure proper duty is collected for imported goods. CBP officials also view Automated Commercial Environment data in CBP’s Automated Targeting System, which is a decision support tool that analyzes shipment data to assess risk and identify potential violations. The Automated Targeting System includes automated alerts, which notify CBP officials when they need to take additional actions before shipments can be released. Information about NRC and Agreement State licenses for radiological material is included in NRC’s Web-Based Licensing System, which includes information about NRC and Agreement State licenses for category 1 and 2 quantities of radiological material. In addition, the Web-Based Licensing System includes up-to-date information on all NRC and six Agreement States’ specific licenses, including licenses that authorize possession of radiological material below the category 2 threshold. However, licenses for quantities of material below the category 2 threshold issued by 31 Agreement States are not kept in the system. The CBP data systems used to identify shipments for license verification are listed in table 2. CBP has implemented a policy and procedures requiring CBP officials at airports to contact experts within a centralized CBP office to verify licenses for radiological material being shipped into the United States. Specifically, CBP issued its “Radiation Detection Standard Operating Procedures Directive” policy in March 2014, outlining when CBP officials at ports of entry are required to contact internal experts at CBP’s Teleforensic Center who possess the technical expertise to verify that NRC and Agreement State licenses for radiological materials are legitimate. The function of the Teleforensic Center is to provide field CBP officials with assistance in resolving scientific and technological questions, including detection, isolation, and control of potential threats that may result from the presence of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear materials. The Teleforensic Center is staffed with scientists with expertise in a range of scientific disciplines, including chemistry, biology, explosives, radiological science, and nuclear science. The Teleforensic Center has established a hotline to receive requests for license verification, among other things, and the experts are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. CBP’s 2014 policy requires CBP personnel to verify the legitimacy of NRC and Agreement State licenses for all commercial imports of industrial and medical radionuclides that require a license from NRC or one of the 37 Agreement States. To implement this policy, CBP has established procedures for private-sector entities and CBP. These procedures, which apply equally to all quantities and types of licensable radiological material, can be broken down into three parts: submission of paperwork, identification of material, and verification of the license by experts in the Teleforensic Center, as outlined in figure 1. Once the shipment information is entered into the Automated Commercial Environment, CBP data systems identify which shipments of radiological material require license verification. Specifically, CBP’s Automated Targeting System uses certain information to identify shipments requiring license verification. Details about this information are omitted from this report because they were deemed to be sensitive by CBP. Once shipments are flagged as containing licensable radiological material, an alert is sent to CBP officials at the airport informing them that the material requires a license from NRC or an Agreement State. The alert outlines the steps the officials need to take to verify that the license is legitimate. Among other things, the alert explicitly states the phone number for contacting the Teleforensic Center and includes instructions for handling the material. According to CBP procedures, CBP officials are not allowed to release the shipment until they receive approval from the Teleforensic Center. Officials at the Teleforensic Center primarily use NRC’s Web-Based Licensing database to verify the legitimacy of licenses granted by NRC. However, as we’ve previously reported, licenses for some radiological material that are granted by Agreement States are not kept in that database, requiring the center’s experts to also call specific points of contacts at Agreement States to verify these licenses. CBP officials told us that Agreement State offices typically are not open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, occasionally requiring CBP to hold shipments until an official can be reached. In addition to consulting the Web-Based Licensing database and contacting Agreement State officials to verify licenses, experts at the Teleforensic Center can also request additional information from CBP officials at the airports. After the experts verify that a license is legitimate, they give approval to the CBP officials at the airport to release the shipment. CBP officials at the airport then document the release. CBP officials at the four airports we visited and experts at the Teleforensic Center told us that it typically takes 30 to 90 minutes to verify a license, but it can take longer if the experts have to consult with an Agreement State. If a license cannot be verified, the shipment is returned to the sender or, in the case of an illegal shipment, seized and referred to proper law enforcement officials, as outlined in the policy. CBP has not verified all licenses for radiological materials as required in its policy and procedures. During the 21-month period we reviewed, CBP personnel at airports across the country did not verify the legitimacy of a significant number of shipments CBP considered as containing potentially dangerous radiological material. CBP officials at two of the four airports we visited may not have verified the legitimacy of licenses for many of the shipments of radiological material imported during the 21-month period, which was not consistent with CBP policy. After we brought this issue to CBP’s attention, it issued additional guidance. However, this guidance was not clear and caused confusion at the two airports we visited where actions continued to be taken that were not consistent with CBP policy. CBP officials did not verify the legitimacy of licenses for many of the shipments of radiological material imported from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016. We found that during this time frame, CBP officials stationed at airports nationwide did not make the required calls to verify licenses for a significant number of shipments of radiological material identified by CBP as requiring license verification—leaving many licenses unverified over this 21-month period. These shipments came through airports across the United States and, according to CBP officials we interviewed, arrived by both express courier and air cargo companies. At two of the four airports we visited, we observed that CBP officials were taking actions that were consistent with CBP policy. Specifically, we noted the following: At one airport, officials responsible for reviewing shipments of imported radiological material told us that they call the Teleforensic Center whenever they receive an alert from CBP’s data system, consistent with CBP policy. In addition, the officials said that they send any requested information to the Teleforensic Center and wait for approval from the center before releasing shipments. At another airport, officials responsible for reviewing shipments of imported radiological material told us that they also call the Teleforensic Center whenever they receive an alert and only release shipments upon receiving approval. However, at the remaining two airports we visited, officials responsible for reviewing shipments of imported radiological material took actions that were not consistent with CBP policy to verify the legitimacy of radiological shipments entering the country. As a result, officials at these airports had not verified hundreds of licenses as required under CBP’s policy because the officials misunderstood what they were required to do. In discussions with these officials, some described taking actions that were not consistent with the license verification requirements. Details about the extent of verification are omitted from this report because the information was deemed to be sensitive by CBP. At one airport, CBP officials told us they typically verify licenses on- site without calling the Teleforensic Center. This airport had more than 100 shipments of licensable radiological material during the 21-month period for which CBP provided data, but officials only made a few calls to the Teleforensic Center to verify licenses during this time, leaving many shipments of material unverified. Instead of calling the Teleforensic Center as required, the CBP officials said that they reviewed the shipment paperwork and looked for anomalies. CBP officials said that they undertake this paperwork review regardless of the risk of the radiological material in the shipment. For example, they said they would use this approach to verify licenses for category 1 materials, which NRC and the International Atomic Energy Agency classify as likely to cause permanent injury to a person who comes into contact with them. The officials told us that they call the Teleforensic Center only when there is something wrong with the shipment. Officials at CBP headquarters told us that this procedure does not comply with their verification policy and would not be effective. At the second airport, CBP officials we interviewed told us that license verification was conducted by private-sector express couriers overseas, negating the need for officials at the port of entry to call the Teleforensic Center. The CBP officials at the airport believed that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between CBP and private companies delegates responsibility to express couriers to scan material with radiation detection equipment. These CBP airport officials said that express couriers also verify licenses as part of this process. However, the MOU between CBP and express couriers does not address the verification of licenses for radiological shipments. CBP headquarters officials we interviewed told us that the airport’s practice does not comply with the agency’s verification policy and confirmed that the Teleforensic Center is the only entity that can verify licenses. The headquarters officials also reiterated to us that license verification is not conducted by overseas private-sector companies. Officials we interviewed from an express courier that ships radiological material also told us that they do not verify licenses. This airport made few calls to the Teleforensic Center to verify licenses during the 21-month period, according to the data provided to us by CBP. In February 2017, we briefed CBP headquarters officials on our findings from the site visits to the four airports. We included in our briefing a summary of findings from our site visits and information on the number of calls made by CBP officials to verify licenses. At this meeting, CBP headquarters officials indicated that they would look into why calls were not made. Subsequently, in March 2017, in response to this briefing, CBP headquarters issued additional guidance to remind all field officials of CBP’s license verification policy. The guidance states that CBP officials must contact the Teleforensic Center to verify the license for all shipments of licensable radiological material. In addition, the guidance states that shipments may not be released from the airport until experts at the Teleforensic Center have completed verification of the license. The guidance was issued in the form of a “muster”—a type of memorandum addressed to all CBP field offices to emphasize CBP policy. Once such a memorandum is issued, CBP relies on local officials to interpret and pass along this information to those working directly with the shipments. According to CBP officials, the guidance was communicated to managers and then the managers communicated this information to front-line staff through weekly meetings and informal discussions. However, the muster was not successful in correcting previous misconceptions at the two airports we visited where officials’ actions were not consistent with CBP policy and the muster did not fully resolve their noncompliance with CBP policy. In part this was because, according to officials, they found the muster confusing. In April and May 2017, several weeks after CBP issued the muster, we contacted officials at the four airports we previously visited. Based on interviews with CBP officials at the two airports where actions were not consistent with CBP policy before the muster, we determined that they were continuing to take actions that were not consistent with CBP policy after they received the muster. For example, CBP officials at one of the two airports said they were continuing to conduct license verification without the assistance of the Teleforensic Center. Officials at this airport told us that they believed their actions were consistent with the policy, even though they had not altered their actions in response to the muster. Similarly, at the other airport where actions were not consistent with the CBP policy before the muster, officials told us again that license verification can be conducted overseas by express couriers, citing the MOU allowing express couriers to scan material with radiation detection equipment. When we discussed the content of the muster with CBP officials in headquarters in June 2017, they acknowledged the muster was confusing and stated it needed to be further clarified. Subsequent to our June 2017 meeting with CBP officials, they provided additional data that suggested an increase in calls to the Teleforensic Center. In July 2017, CBP officials told us they planned to issue additional clarifications. Subsequently, in November 2017, CBP issued an additional muster emphasizing its policy to call the Teleforensic Center for all shipments of licensable radiological material. CBP headquarters officials told us that they were unaware, until we informed them, that selected airports were not calling the Teleforensic Center to verify licenses and that licenses were not being verified for some imported radiological material. This is because CBP does not have a mechanism, such as a monitoring system, to ensure that all required license verifications are occurring. Such a system could also conduct checks to ensure CBP officials are following agency policy. The challenge to creating such a system is that CBP houses the data necessary to create it in separate systems that do not communicate with each other, and these systems are currently run by different offices with differing missions within CBP. Federal standards for internal control state that management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results. Until CBP develops a monitoring system to help ensure that CBP officials comply with the license verification policy, the agency will not have reasonable assurance that it can identify activities that are inconsistent with its policy and take corrective action as necessary. CBP policies and procedures are not effective at ensuring that only properly licensed radiological material is imported into the United States. Specifically, CBP’s procedures for identifying licensable radiological material do not ensure that all shipments of radiological material are identified and verified, resulting in the exclusion of a significant number of shipments that possibly contained radioactive material during the 21- month period we reviewed. Moreover, CBP’s current policy and procedures treat all radiological shipments with the same level of scrutiny and do not target resources based on the risk of the material. Details about these issues are omitted from this report because the information was deemed to be sensitive by CBP. CBP procedures for identifying licensable radiological material do not effectively implement its policy to verify the license for all shipments of licensable radiological material. We identified the following issues that result in limitations in CBP’s procedures. Specifically, the data system that CBP uses to implement its procedures does not sufficiently identify all shipments of potentially dangerous radiological materials. To implement its procedures, the agency chose to use an existing data system designed to process all types of imports into the United States. This system uses general customs information to identify the contents of shipments. Consequently, of the 44,152 shipments that could contain licensable radiological material, the system alerted CBP officials that they were required to verify relatively few licenses from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016. In addition, CBP’s license verification procedures do not currently target the higher-risk radiological materials. CBP’s method for identifying the contents of shipments does not include information that describes the quantity of radiological material. Specifically, categories 1, 2, and 3 quantities of radiological material can cause permanent injury or death to a person in contact with them for some period of time. As a result, according to a senior CBP official, it is safer to assume all shipments of radiological material are dangerous until proven otherwise. Federal standards for internal control recommend that agencies design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Until CBP develops a robust system that can identify all shipments of radiological material that pose risk, it will not have reasonable assurance that it has the appropriate policies and procedures necessary to verify licenses for these shipments. Furthermore, as we reported in December 2016, an essential element of enterprise risk management is to examine risks considering both the likelihood of the risk and the impact of the risk on the mission, in order to help prioritize risk response. Although CBP officials recognize that their current system and procedures have limitations and do not allow them to fully implement the agency policy to verify all shipments of radiological material that enter the United States, we found that they have not developed a system nor revised their procedures to address the issues we identified. Of particular concern is that CBP has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of (1) the information not currently included in the automated alert to determine what additional information would indicate shipments that may contain dangerous material or (2) how to create a more risk-based approach that distinguishes between higher- and lower-risk categories of radiological materials. Until it conducts such an assessment, CBP will not know how to adjust its current procedures to ensure that it is identifying all shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material and targeting its limited resources to those that pose the greatest risk. CBP has implemented a policy and procedures intended to ensure that the tens of thousands of shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material imported through U.S. airports each year are properly licensed. However, CBP’s procedures do not effectively implement CBP’s policy of ensuring that only properly licensed radiological material gains entry to the United States. This is because CBP does not have a monitoring system to help ensure that CBP officials at airports nationwide are complying with the license verification policy. Until CBP develops such a system, the agency will not have reasonable assurance that it can identify activities that are inconsistent with its policy and take corrective action as necessary. In addition, CBP’s procedures for identifying licensable radiological material do not ensure that all shipments of radiological material are identified and verified. This is the result of CBP’s automated alert, which currently does not include all relevant information needed to identify such shipments. Additionally, CBP procedures do not distinguish between high-risk categories of radiological materials and lower-risk categories; therefore CBP cannot target its limited resources to the shipments that pose the greatest risk. CBP has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the information not currently included in the automated alert and does not know which shipments pose the greatest risk. A comprehensive assessment could help CBP gain a better understanding of information not currently included in the automated alert, and it could better position the agency to make appropriate changes to its existing system and procedures, as well as target its limited resources toward the quantities of material that pose the greatest risk. We are making the following three recommendations to CBP: The Commissioner of CBP should develop a monitoring system to help ensure that CBP officials comply with license verification policies and procedures. (Recommendation 1) The Commissioner of CBP should conduct a comprehensive assessment of information not included in the automated alert to determine what information is needed to identify licensable radiological material. (Recommendation 2) The Commissioner of CBP should develop a system that better identifies shipments of radiological material that pose the greatest risk and revise CBP’s policies and procedures as necessary to verify licenses for these shipments. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this product to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and NRC for review and comment. DHS provided written comments, reproduced in appendix I, in which it concurred with our three recommendations. DHS stated that it will take the following actions, among others, to address our recommendations: (1) include a monitoring process in an updated version of its policy addressing license verification, (2) conduct a comprehensive assessment of information not included in the automated alert to determine what information is associated with dangerous material, and (3) develop an intelligence-driven process that identifies shipments of radiological materials that pose the greatest threat. In addition, DHS and NRC provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions concerning this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or trimbled@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made significant contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. In addition to the individual named above, Ned Woodward, Assistant Director; Jeffrey Barron; Richard Burkard; Kendall Childers; Cindy Gilbert; Cynthia Norris; Danny Royer; Jerry Sandau; Travis Schwartz; and Kiki Theodoropoulos made key contributions to this report.", "answers": ["Thousands of shipments containing radiological material enter the United States each year through airports across the country. Radiological material is used in various medical and industrial applications, and possession requires a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or one of the 37 states to which NRC has relinquished licensing authority. Failure to verify the licenses could allow terrorists to acquire radiological material for a dirty bomb, which uses explosives to disperse the material. GAO was asked to review CBP policies and procedures related to license verification. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which CBP follows its policies and procedures, and (2) the effectiveness of these policies and procedures. GAO reviewed relevant policies and procedures, analyzed CBP data related to radiological material shipments and license verification, interviewed CBP and NRC officials, and selected four airports to visit based on expected traffic of radiological shipments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency officials at U.S. airports have not verified the legitimacy of all licenses for imported radiological materials as required by CBP's policy. The policy requires CBP officials, when alerted, to verify licenses by calling experts in a centralized CBP office. CBP officials at two of four airports GAO visited said they were calling as required. However, CBP officials at the other two airports did not verify many licenses from January 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016, and headquarters officials were unaware of non-compliance with CBP policy. Also, GAO found that during this time frame nationwide, CBP officials were alerted to verify licenses for a significant number of shipments of licensable radiological material for all U.S. airports, but they did not make all the required calls—leaving numerous shipments potentially unverified over this 21-month period. This situation occurred because CBP does not have a monitoring system to ensure that officials make license verification calls as required. Until CBP develops a monitoring system for license verification, it will not have reasonable assurance that it can identify activities inconsistent with its policy and take corrective action. CBP procedures cannot effectively implement the agency's policy that its officials verify all radiological material shipments imported into the United States. The procedures are not effective for this policy in part because they rely on automated alerts that are based on some but not all relevant information that could indicate potentially dangerous radiological material. Consequently, CBP's current system and procedures cannot ensure that all such materials will be identified. Under federal internal control standards, agencies are to design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. However, CBP does not have the information it needs to develop a robust system or revise its procedures because it has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the information not included in its automated alert system. In particular, CBP has not assessed relevant information not currently included in the automated alert or how to create a more risk-based approach that distinguishes between higher- and lower-risk quantities of radiological materials. Without such an assessment, CBP may be unable to develop a system or procedures that best support its policy for verifying imported radiological materials. This is a public version of a sensitive report GAO issued in September 2017. Information CBP deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends that CBP develop a monitoring system to help ensure that CBP officials comply with the agency's license verification policy, conduct an assessment to determine relevant information that is not included in the automated alerts, and develop a system that allows it to identify shipments of greatest risk. CBP concurred with GAO's three recommendations and outlined actions to implement those recommendations."], "length": 5096, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "909c4c1ec52c09ac4e2bda864eecef21e6ead9b2a605bb77"}
{"input": "", "context": "USMS mission areas include fugitive apprehension, witness protection, and federal prisoner transportation, among others. There are 94 U.S. Marshals—one for each federal judicial district—who are presidentially appointed and direct agency operations in each district. U.S. Marshals are considered to generally operate autonomously from headquarter offices and divisions. USMS’s current workforce consists of roughly 3,709 Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators, and approximately 1,435 Detention Enforcement Officers and administrative employees. In general, a cadre of Deputy U.S. Marshals in each district collectively conducts various activities associated with the USMS mission areas. In addition, Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators who are assigned to headquarter operational divisions are located in district offices and work collectively with district employees across the 94 districts to carry out division functions. Deputy U.S. Marshals are categorized into two federal government occupational series – 0082 and 1811. USMS typically hires entry-level Deputy U.S. Marshals in the 0082 series at the GS-5 or GS-7 level. At the GS-11 level, deputies automatically convert to the 1811 series and receive non-competitive career ladder promotions through GS-12 if they complete the required waiting period for advancement to the next grade level and maintain an acceptable level of performance. For GS-13 and above, deputies must compete for promotions through the operational merit promotion process. USMS’s Human Resources Division (HRD) is responsible for issuing and implementing policy guidelines, revisions, and supplements in accordance with appropriate regulations and merit system principles. HRD also periodically assesses the effectiveness of merit promotion policy, assists in filling division and district vacancies, and reports officials who inappropriately discriminate against candidates, and candidates who engage in improper behavior, such as willful exaggeration, misstatements, or other abuses of the application process. USMS’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) oversees the internal compliance review of USMS staff, division, and district offices, which assess compliance with DOJ and USMS policies and procedures, and ensures the integrity of the agency’s internal controls. Congress passed the Pendleton Act in 1883, establishing that federal employment should be based on merit. The nine merit system principles established by the Pendleton Act were later codified as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The first merit principle indicates that federal personnel management should be implemented consistent with certain merit system principles, including that selection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity. Title 5 of the United States Code refers to the government-wide personnel management laws and related provisions generally applicable to federal employment. While title 5 of the United States Code generally outlines the rules agencies must follow to make appointments in the competitive service, excepted service, and the senior executive service, agencies have significant discretion to design and implement internal merit promotion policies and processes. Title 5 also states that federal personnel management should be implemented consistent with merit system principles that protect federal employees against “personal favoritism.” According to MSPB, personal favoritism occurs when a supervisor or selecting official grants an advantage to one employee or candidate but not another similarly situated employee or candidate based on friendship or other affinity rather than a legitimate merit-based reason. Favoritism is distinct from discrimination on legally protected bases and is frequently more difficult to clearly identify when it occurs. OPM is responsible for overseeing all policy created to support Federal human resources departments as well as for ensuring that these policies are properly implemented and continue to be correctly carried out. OPM delegates many personnel decisions to federal agencies, but is responsible for establishing and maintaining an oversight program ensuring that the personnel management functions it delegates to agencies are in accordance with merit system principles and the standards established by OPM for conducting those functions. OPM has also established minimum qualification requirements for hiring or promoting individual employees under the competitive process. In addition, OPM allows agencies to make minimum qualification requirements more specific by adding selective placement factors. According to OPM, selective placement factors identify any qualifications that are important for the job and are required when an individual starts the job. Candidates who do not meet selective placement factors are ineligible for further consideration. OPM generally allows agencies to establish selective placement factors for any position without prior OPM approval, but requires agencies to establish and document selective placement factors through the job analysis process. OPM guidance also states that selective placement factors have four characteristics: extensive training or experience to develop; essential for successful performance on the job (i.e., if individuals do not have the selective factor, they cannot perform the job); almost always are geared toward a specific technical competency; cannot be learned on the job in a reasonable amount of time. We determined that the USMS merit promotion policy aligns with relevant provisions of title 5 of the United States Code, and title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Specifically, the most recent version of the USMS Merit Promotion Plan, which was revised in November 2016, outlines the mechanisms for affording merit staffing and promotional opportunities to competitive status candidates for GS-13, GS-14, and GS-15 1811 operational law enforcement positions. The plan states that it is the policy of the USMS to maintain a sound staffing program that will ensure that USMS fills positions from among the best qualified candidates and that the selection, assignment, and promotion of employees are on the basis of job-related criteria. The Merit Promotion Plan cites parts of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations as the governing authority under which the plan was developed and aligns with key provisions of title 5 of the United States Code and title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Agencies must design and administer merit promotion programs to ensure a systematic means of selection for promotion based on merit. These programs must conform to five requirements outlined in title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Table 1 describes the five requirements and how key provisions in the USMS Merit Promotion Plan align with these requirements. USMS has developed a multi-step process based on the USMS Merit Promotion Plan to assess and select eligible candidates for promotion. To be considered eligible for promotion to GS-13, GS-14, or GS-15 law enforcement positions, candidates must (1) serve one year in an operational position at the next lower grade than the position desired; (2) take the most recent USMS merit promotion examination, which is administered every two years; and (3) submit required documents, including the promotion application package, during an annual open season submission process. Once candidates have met these prerequisites, they may apply to individual position vacancy announcements, which are advertised electronically to all USMS employees. Figure 1 depicts the multiple steps in the USMS merit promotion process. Table 2 provides a detailed description of the multiple steps in the USMS merit promotion process. USMS does not monitor the implementation of the scoring component of its rating process or compliance with its temporary promotion policy, but is taking steps to improve these aspects. We found that raters may directly compete with candidates whose merit promotion packages they score. For example, for an open GS-13 position, a GS-12 employee may promote into the position or a GS-13 employee may be laterally reassigned to the position. Employees seeking a lateral reassignment to another district or division are not required to submit a merit promotion application package during the open season, but instead submit documentation to the merit promotion staff to confirm their eligibility for a lateral reassignment. Thus, a GS-13 employee who serves as a rater may directly compete as a lateral candidate with a GS-12 employee seeking a promotion to the same position. Some USMS employees in our discussion groups expressed the view that the rating process is biased due to this potential conflict of interest. Specifically, seven employees across multiple districts, including four who had served as raters, expressed the view that raters may have personal incentives to score strong candidates lower because they may compete with these candidates for the same positions. The Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control (A-123) explains that an agency should have processes in place to detect and mitigate potential employee conflicts of interest to demonstrate a commitment to integrity and ethical values. We found that USMS does not have a process in place to eliminate potential rater conflicts of interest. USMS stated that it would be difficult to detect situations where raters who might be seeking a lateral reassignment would be scoring a potential competitor, but acknowledged that to the extent this is occurring, it would be a conflict of interest. USMS also does not monitor the implementation of the rating component of its process to ensure that raters complied with a key merit promotion process requirement. Specifically, USMS guidance states that raters are expected to decline to score a candidate’s application if there is a conflict of interest with the candidate, for example, a former employee or supervisor relationship or a close personal relationship. USMS officials explained that using two raters to score each merit promotion application is intended to mitigate personal bias. However, during our discussion groups, 4 employees who had served as raters said they had directly observed raters scoring applications for employees with whom there existed possible conflicts of interest. Additionally, 18 employees in our discussion groups told us they had heard from colleagues who served on rating panels that raters have used personal knowledge of candidates to influence their scoring. Another 16 employees expressed a related concern that raters can see the names of the applicants they are scoring. According to HRD officials, they relied on raters to decline to score applications of candidates for which they may have personal knowledge and only use the information in the package to determine candidate scores. Although USMS does not monitor the implementation of key aspects of its rating process to mitigate potential rater conflicts of interest or bias, USMS has begun to implement changes that could address these deficiencies. In February 2017, during the course of our review, USMS announced a planned change to the process the agency uses to assess the experience component of candidate applications. Under the existing process, USMS raters collectively score the experience narrative component, which helps determine the overall merit promotion score. The planned change entails having a third-party contractor, rather than USMS employees, determine candidates’ competency scores using a scenario- based competency assessment. As part of the new process, USMS also updated the scoring rubric based on the new competency assessment, which includes the elimination of the experience category (see table 3). USMS started to implement this change to the process during the summer 2017 promotion cycle for GS-13 promotions. USMS plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the new process during the fall of 2017 and determine whether the new process is ready to be implemented for GS- 14 and GS-15 promotions during the next promotion cycle. If USMS effectively implements these planned changes, these actions could address the deficiencies we identified by reducing the potential for rater conflict of interest and bias because independent, third-party raters will assess candidate qualifications, rather than USMS employees evaluating their colleagues. We reviewed USMS compliance with federal guidelines for noncompetitive temporary promotions and found, in a few instances, that USMS violated federal guidelines and its merit promotion policy by extending some noncompetitive temporary promotions beyond the regulatory limit of 120 days. According to USMS officials, they typically use temporary promotions to fill open positions between merit promotion cycles. A temporary promotion may also be used to temporarily promote a GS-14 employee to the Chief Deputy position in the event a U.S. Marshal resigns and the Chief Deputy becomes the acting U.S. Marshal. According to title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the USMS Merit Promotion Plan, individual employees may receive noncompetitive temporary promotions or details to a higher-graded position, or a position with known promotion potential, if the total time spent in any noncompetitive position is 120 days or less within a 12-month timeframe. USMS may also fill open positions between cycles using another type of temporary promotion for up to one year; however, employees are required to compete for temporary promotions beyond 120 days through the merit promotion process. These requirements help USMS use a systematic process of selection according to merit. We analyzed all 844 noncompetitive temporary promotion selections (of 120 days or less) from October 2015 through February 2017 and found 9 instances in which the USMS exceeded the regulatory limit of 120 days for individual employees. These 9 instances exceeded the statutory limit by approximately 30 days on average, while ranging from 5 days to 103 days. USMS officials acknowledged that because they manually enter the noncompetitive temporary promotion end dates into the system that contains the temporary promotions data, they have made errors in reviewing these dates, such as incorrectly adding dates for candidates who have received multiple noncompetitive temporary promotions that exceeded a 12-month timeframe. According to HRD, this system has internal checks and controls to ensure an employee’s temporary promotion does not go beyond the not-to-exceed date. For example, the system does not allow an employee who received a noncompetitive temporary promotion to a higher grade level to continue to be paid at the higher level beyond the date the temporary promotion is set to expire unless HRD processes an action to extend the promotion. Otherwise, to ensure the employee continues to be paid, HRD must process an action to revert the employee back to their original grade level. USMS officials explained that they must manually review instances in which employees receive multiple noncompetitive temporary promotions within a year, to ensure the total time spent serving in these positions does not exceed 120 days during any 12-month period. Despite having identified relatively infrequent instances of non- compliance, we note that agencies are required to comply with federal regulations. As a result of our review, USMS took immediate steps to strengthen its internal controls to ensure its compliance with these temporary promotion regulations. Specifically, USMS reported to us that they developed a spreadsheet to help staffing specialists correctly calculate the number of days the employee is eligible for a temporary promotion. Moreover, USMS has developed training on how to use the new tool and on the federal regulations that guide temporary promotions, which it plans to provide to staffing specialists in October 2017. Finally, USMS plans to incorporate a regular review of temporary promotion actions into the HRD standard operating procedure. USMS provides verbal guidance to instruct raters on how to score the experience category of merit promotion packages, which may result in inconsistent application of the guidance. USMS Merit Promotion Procedures generally state that raters assign a numerical grade to each experience category—such as problem-solving or leadership—by comparing how the experience described in the application relates to the established benchmarks. The benchmarks, which are provided to raters, contain descriptions of relevant experience that are designed to guide the raters as they assign scores to specific knowledge, skills and abilities, such as supervising staff and working with databases. At the beginning of the scoring process, each rating panel receives verbal guidance from merit promotion staff, which entails using actual candidate applications as examples and verbally discussing how to use professional judgment to apply the benchmarks. Some employees in our discussion groups expressed the opinion that the guidance provided to raters to score candidate experience narratives is unclear, which results in inconsistent scoring. Specifically, during our discussion groups, 39 employees across multiple districts, including 7 employees who had served as a rater, stated that raters often had different interpretations of HRD’s expectations for how to apply the benchmarks. For example, they stated that some raters determined scores based on whether a candidate’s narrative contained the specific language in the benchmark. Other raters, by contrast, determined scores based on whether the candidate met the intent of the benchmark, regardless of whether the candidate included the specific language in the benchmark. As a result, employees in our discussion groups explained that highly qualified candidates with relevant management and supervisory experience may receive a low experience score if a rater determines that the candidate did not use the exact language appearing in the benchmarks. Furthermore, 70 of 85 employees (82 percent) expressed the view that inconsistent scoring of similarly qualified candidates creates the perception that the rating process is unfairly subjective. Specifically, they asserted that comparable candidates with similar types of experience have received vastly different scores depending on which raters scored their applications. Two employees in different districts also said that they re-submitted the same experience narrative as the prior year, and received a significantly different score each year. Additionally, approximately 20 employees contended that raters may be influenced by their own professional experiences. For example, raters who have operational experiences that are different from candidates’ experiences may not sufficiently understand the duties or professional experiences described by candidates. Consequently, they argued, these raters may be limited in their ability to fairly rate some candidates’ experiences. Although USMS is implementing a new competency assessment process for GS-13 merit promotions, it is not clear at this time whether the new process will address concerns about inconsistent rater scoring because the agency plans to use new benchmarks that were developed by a third- party contractor in collaboration with USMS subject matter experts to determine candidate scores. According to USMS officials, the new process will entail professionally trained assessors using evaluation guidelines to assess how well USMS promotion candidates respond to scenario-based questions. In collaboration with the contractor, USMS also developed evaluation guidelines that include plans for monitoring quality assurance over the rating process. For example, according to USMS officials, the third-party contractor will conduct random spot checks to assess the consistency with which raters apply the new benchmarks and will provide USMS a report on the results of the quality assurance monitoring. However, given that USMS implemented these changes near the end of our review, we did not assess the implementation of the new process or the related quality assurance monitoring. Furthermore, until USMS determines a timeframe for implementing the new competency assessment at the GS-14 and GS-15 levels, the current rating process will remain in effect. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for agency management to determine the consistency with which controls are applied. Furthermore, it states management should document policies in the appropriate level of detail to allow management to effectively monitor the control activity. While USMS provides raters with benchmarks and verbal guidance on how to apply the benchmarks when scoring applications, USMS has not documented guidance for raters. Six employees who had served as raters said the rating guidance provided was insufficient or the guidance could be improved. By developing clear and specific documented guidance on how raters should interpret and apply the benchmark guidelines, USMS could minimize rater subjectivity and scoring inconsistency for both the current rating process and the forthcoming competency-based assessment. According to an OPM report summarizing 2016 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) data, about one-third of USMS employees who answered the survey indicated they agree that promotions are based on merit. Specifically, in response to the survey statement, promotions in my work unit are based on merit, an estimated 41 percent of USMS respondents strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement, while 34 percent strongly agreed or agreed, and 25 percent neither agreed nor disagreed. Based on our review of an agency report examining district and division-level USMS 2016 FEVS scores, district and division scores varied greatly among those employees who responded to the FEVS. For example, across the 10 districts with the lowest reported ratings in 2016, we found that 63 percent to 78 percent of respondents disagreed that promotions are based on merit. By comparison, across the 10 districts with the highest reported satisfaction ratings in 2016, 7 percent to 16 percent of respondents disagreed that promotions are based on merit. Most of the USMS employees at four district locations who met with us and answered our questions viewed the merit promotion process unfavorably, citing concerns primarily related to favoritism in the process. For example, 57 of 82 employees (70 percent) indicated that they had low or no trust that the merit promotion process is fair and based on merit. Employees in lower grade levels expressed a greater degree of mistrust than did those in higher grades (see table 4). Specifically, 45 of 53 GS-12 employees (85 percent) indicated that they had low or no trust in the merit promotion process, while just less than half of GS-13 employees (10 of 22) and relatively few GS-14 employees (2 of 7) said they had low or no trust in the merit promotion process. While most employees (51 of 70, or 73 percent) answered that sometimes qualified candidates get promoted; several explained during our discussion groups that they believe the promotion of less qualified—or unqualified—employees occurs frequently enough to affect morale. Further, 47 of 84 employees (56 percent) noted that morale has deteriorated as a result of merit promotion processes or selections. Finally, most of the employees (66 of 85, or 78 percent) answered that USMS has not taken any steps to understand or improve employee morale or they were unsure of whether any steps had been taken. In addition, USMS employees we talked with during our discussion groups expressed concerns about the USMS merit promotion process. The prevalent themes that emerged during these groups were concerns that (1) promotions are based on favoritism, (2) the promotion process lacks transparency, and (3) promotion guidance is unclear and promotion candidates do not receive feedback. Employees in our discussion groups expressed the view that many promotion decisions are based on personal relationships over individual merit. Notably, 51 of 85 employees in our discussion groups cited examples of qualified candidates who were passed over for promotion by those whom they believed were less-qualified due to favoritism. From their perspective, there have been instances where candidates with high promotion package scores and good reputations as supervisors have not been promoted, while lower scoring candidates with poor reputations as supervisors who have personal relationships with decision-makers have been promoted. Further, 36 employees in our discussion groups said they believed that career-enhancing opportunities, such as temporary promotions, which improve employees’ promotion potential by providing them with directly related experience in positions for which they may be competing, are often provided unfairly to employees based on personal relationships. Employees in our discussion groups also expressed the view that some employees receive more guidance on their application from supervisors than do others, which they attributed to favoritism. As part of the merit promotion process, supervisors are required to verify the experience statements submitted by candidates. We found that among the limited number of supervisors with whom we met, there were varying interpretations of their responsibility in meeting this requirement. Specifically, 1 supervisor viewed his role as strictly verifying the experience and providing no further input. However, 7 other supervisors viewed their role as providing guidance and mentorship to employees by offering advice for improving candidate applications. Finally, 5 additional supervisors said they provided additional guidance to employees only when specifically requested. Of the 85 employees in our discussion groups, 28 indicated that they believed supervisors helped certain candidates develop their merit promotion packages, which provides an unfair advantage over candidates who do not receive such guidance. Additionally, nine employees raised concerns that USMS has sometimes expanded certificate of eligibles lists inconsistent with USMS policy to include preselected, favored candidates. According to the USMS Merit Promotion Plan, if there are more than five candidates applying for a position, at least the top five scoring candidates will generally be included on the list and subsequently referred for candidate selection. In some circumstances, more than five eligible candidates are allowed to be placed on the list. For example, if there is a tie for the last position on the list, all candidates with that score will be included. Additionally, candidates with a score within one point from the fifth highest scoring candidate would also be included on the list. Finally, if there are multiple vacancies for the same position (same series, grade, title, and location), one additional name for each vacancy may be added to the list. To examine USMS compliance with this policy, we analyzed certificate of eligibles lists and the corresponding candidate scores for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For fiscal year 2015, we examined all 213 position vacancies and found 2 instances where additional candidates were included on the list inconsistent with USMS’ established policy. Specifically, these 2 lists contained the names of candidates with scores that were more than one point below the fifth highest-scoring candidate, and of these 2 instances, 1 candidate was promoted. For fiscal year 2016, we examined all 224 position vacancies and did not find any inconsistencies with USMS’ established policy. Whistleblowers who raised concerns about improper promotion practices to Congress had alleged that USMS managers used selective placement factors to limit competition for certain positions or to tailor vacancy announcements for preselected, favored candidates. Similarly, five employees in our discussion groups expressed the view that USMS used selective placement factors to limit competition or pre-select certain candidates. In this regard, we reviewed USMS compliance with OPM requirements for the use of selective placement factors. Specifically, OPM requires that agencies document the justification for using selective placement factors through a job analysis process. We reviewed all job vacancy announcements for fiscal year 2015, fiscal year 2016, and part of fiscal year 2017 (October 2016 through April 2017) to determine if a job analysis had been performed when selective placement factors were included in the announcement. In fiscal year 2015, there were 213 vacancy announcement positions, and 12 contained selective placement factors. We found USMS had not completed a job analysis justification for any one of these 12 announcements. In fiscal year 2016, there were 224 vacancy announcements, and 15 contained selective placement factors. USMS completed a job analysis justification for all 15. For part of fiscal year 2017, there were 171 vacancy announcements, and 23 contained selective placement factors, each of which had a justification. HRD officials acknowledged that in the past they did not consistently document the agency’s use of selective placement factors by conducting job analysis justifications, as required by OPM, but have consistently complied with this requirement since April 2016. Employees in our discussion groups also expressed the view that poor communication and limited transparency about the merit promotion process and certain management decisions further contribute to employees’ negative perceptions of the merit promotion process. For example, among the 85 employees in our discussion groups: Sixty-three employees expressed the view that the merit promotion process lacks transparency because HRD does not effectively communicate with employees about procedural steps or process changes, contributing to a lack of understanding about the process. Forty-eight employees expressed the view that they have a limited understanding of the rating and ranking process or that there is no mechanism to dispute or appeal their score if they do not believe they were fairly rated. Nineteen employees stated that HRD does not provide information about policy or process changes until the changes have been implemented and that they initially learn about forthcoming process changes through other employees and hearsay, causing confusion and frustration. Twenty-five employees expressed the perspective that USMS management cancels vacancy announcements when preselected or favored candidates do not appear on the certificate of eligibles list. According to USMS officials, the agency cancels an announcement when the announcement posting was made in error (i.e., the position was not actually available) or when they need to reassign an employee to a different location. We found vacancy cancellations were infrequent—9 of 437 announcements—during fiscal years 2015 and 2016; however, we noted that USMS canceled 5 of the 9 announcements after final certificate of eligibles were issued, which may have contributed to employees’ concerns. Another prevalent theme that emerged during our discussion groups was that the merit promotion process is unclear, and that employees do not receive feedback when they do not get promoted. Notably, among the 85 employees in our discussion groups: Forty-six employees described the merit promotion process as unclear. Fifty-nine employees stated that the merit promotion application package does not reflect their qualifications to perform specific jobs or their readiness to be promoted. Thirty-seven employees told us they are not notified of key steps in the merit promotion process, such as whether they make the certificate of eligibles list. Thirty-eight employees stated that because they are not provided feedback when they are not selected for a promotion, they do not have a clear understanding of how the USMS promotion process assesses the extent to which candidates are ready for promotion. While there is no formal mechanism for providing specific feedback, HRD officials explained, they may provide general feedback about the process to candidates who proactively request feedback. However, as part of the promotion process, HRD officials do not provide employees with specific feedback at that time about their performance or readiness for promotion. HRD officials also noted that as part of the new competency-based assessment process, candidates will receive detailed instructions and guidance on how candidates will be assessed for each competency. HRD officials acknowledged that informing candidates about key merit promotion steps, such as making the certificate of eligibles, would help improve transparency and employee morale. They further explained that while they do not directly inform candidates about making the certificate of eligibles, in 2016 during the course of our review, they began posting the cutoff scores for each job so candidates are now able to determine whether they made the certificate of eligibles by comparing their final score to the cutoff score for each position. Federal guidance notes that perceptions of favoritism, particularly when combined with unclear guidance, a lack of transparency, and limited feedback, negatively impact employee morale. According to MSPB, perceptions of favoritism are damaging to employee morale regardless of their basis in fact, because employees’ perceptions are their reality. Moreover, MSPB noted that providing honest feedback from selecting officials can help employees improve their readiness for future opportunities, and provide transparency to decrease perceptions of favoritism. The report further noted that to achieve the goals of fair and effective management of the federal workforce, organizations must establish clear expectations for supervisors, and supervisors must be aware of employees’ perceptions and exercise sound judgment when making a variety of decisions such as promotion selections, work assignments, training, performance management, and providing workplace flexibilities. In addition, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should communicate quality information down and across reporting lines to enable personnel to perform key roles in achieving objectives, addressing risks, and supporting the internal control system. Providing specific and consistent information to employees about key steps in the merit promotion process and internal management decisions, and constructive feedback to employees on the results of the promotion process, including employee readiness for promotion, would improve transparency and help mitigate employee perceptions of favoritism that have negatively impacted employee morale. USMS has taken limited steps to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion process. Specifically, after analyzing the results of the 2016 FEVS responses, USMS headquarters staff acknowledged employees’ negative perceptions of the merit promotion process as an internal agency challenge. In an update provided to DOJ on plans for addressing employee engagement challenges identified in the FEVS, USMS reported that the primary employee engagement challenges are the geographical dispersal and management structure of district offices (since USMS districts are led by political appointees, who have different management styles). To address this challenge, USMS disseminated an agency-wide memorandum emphasizing to all employees that each employee and manager has an individual responsibility to take action to improve engagement at the local level. Also, USMS encouraged local managers to evaluate their FEVS results and formulate an action plan that fits their individual district or division. USMS does not track the extent to which district and divisions complete action plans and does not require district or division offices to submit their action plans to HRD. We found that none of the four districts we visited had developed a written action plan in response to the 2016 FEVS results. At three of these districts, the Chief Deputy U.S. Marshals indicated to us that no steps were being taken to develop an action plan because they did not consider it a required or necessary step. However, the Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal in one district explained that while he did not document an action plan, he took steps to better understand employee engagement challenges identified in the FEVS for his district. Specifically, he facilitated small discussion groups to better understand low employee agreement with two FEVS survey statements, including promotions in my work unit are based on merit. During these discussions, he said that he aimed to clarify areas where employees’ negative perspectives were based on a lack of understanding about the merit promotion process. While USMS has taken some positive steps, having a better understanding of the basis for these concerns, and how to address them, will likely require that USMS take additional steps. Most of the employees we interviewed said they were unaware of whether USMS has taken any steps to understand or improve employee morale related to merit promotions, and some feared raising concerns to management. Specifically, 25 of 85 (29 percent) employees in our discussion groups said no steps were taken to understand or improve employee morale, while an additional 41 employees (48 percent) were unsure that any steps were taken. Further, 24 of 85 employees in our discussion groups expressed fears of raising concerns to USMS district or headquarters management, citing allegations of district management intimidating or retaliating against employees who raise issues, such as not selecting those employees for career-enhancing opportunities or promotions. To the extent that employees fear they will not get promoted if they raise concerns to management and management does not have sufficient information to understand the nature and causes of employee concerns about the merit promotion process, taking meaningful and effective steps to address the concerns will be difficult. OMB and OPM intend for agency managers to use the findings in the FEVS to develop policies and action plans for improving agency performance, including the enhancement of employee engagement and satisfaction. According to OPM, action plans should be developed at multiple levels; agency-wide, by subcomponent, and several levels down in the agency. Also, many agencies have found it beneficial to conduct focus groups after reviewing survey results to better understand the underlying causes of employee engagement scores and get employee suggestions for how to improve. OPM’s action planning guidance also suggests that agencies specify time frames for accomplishing the actions, who will be responsible for implementing the actions, who will be affected by the actions, the resources required, and a plan to communicate these actions to managers and employees. Although HRD disseminated a memorandum requesting district and division managers to develop action plans, it has not developed an agency-wide action plan, nor has it taken steps to ensure that all districts and divisions develop action plans. By delegating responsibility for developing action plans to individual districts and divisions, HRD does not have consistent or adequate information to understand the nature and causes of employee concerns across districts and divisions. Without this information, USMS is unable to address employee concerns about its merit promotion process and remains vulnerable to adverse effects, such as decreased employee satisfaction and engagement, and decreased agency performance. USMS management stated that they take employee concerns and feedback into consideration as appropriate, but are primarily concerned with ensuring the process is implemented in accordance with legal requirements. They further stated that they generally believe the USMS merit promotion process to be fair, and attributed some employee concerns with the merit promotion process to a lack of available positions relative to the number of employees who are ready for promotion. Nevertheless, we believe an agency-wide action plan would help USMS more fully understand and address areas where employees express negative perceptions of the merit promotion process. Selecting candidates based on their qualifications instead of patronage has been the foundation of the federal hiring system for more than 130 years. Federal guidelines give agencies significant discretion to design and implement their merit promotion processes to best meet their needs. Since 2016, USMS has been implementing changes to its merit promotion process in response to multiple internal and external investigations, which substantiated allegations made by whistleblowers. While the new competency assessment process has the potential to reduce the risk of rater conflicts of interest and bias, USMS could still do more to further improve its process. Developing specific guidance to help raters more consistently score candidate applications would minimize scoring subjectivity. Continuing to take steps to improve this process would better position USMS to improve employee engagement. In light of the significant distrust in the merit promotion practices we heard from employees, USMS management can also take further action to better understand and appropriately address employee concerns, such as providing employees specific feedback on the results of the promotion process, including their readiness for promotion and developing an agency-wide action plan to more fully understand and address areas where employees express negative perceptions of the merit promotion process. More actively engaging employees could also bolster ongoing USMS efforts to improve the promotion process and enhance agency performance. We recommend that the Director of the USMS take the following actions: Develop specific documented guidance—both for the current and new processes—to enhance raters’ ability to consistently interpret and apply experience-based benchmarks for GS-14 and GS-15 positions and competency-based benchmarks for GS-13 positions when evaluating candidate qualifications. (Recommendation 1) Develop and implement a mechanism to provide specific feedback to employees on the results of the promotion process, including their readiness for promotion. (Recommendation 2) Develop and implement an agency-wide action plan to more fully understand and address areas where employees express negative perceptions of the merit promotion process. Consistent with OPM guidance in this area, the plan should specify time frames for accomplishing the actions, who will be responsible for implementing the actions, who will be affected by the actions, the resources required, and a plan to communicate these actions to managers and employees. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to DOJ and USMS for review and comment. Liaisons from DOJ and USMS responded in an email that DOJ had no formal comments on the report. In addition, the USMS liaison concurred with the recommendations and provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to DOJ, the Director of the USMS, appropriate congressional committees and members, and other interested parties.

GAO staff that made significant contributions to this report are listed in appendix I. In addition to the contact named above, Brett Fallavollita (Assistant Director), Carissa Bryant (Analyst-in-Charge), Jessica Du, and Kelsey Hawley made key contributions to this report, along with David Alexander, Willie Commons III, Dominick Dale, and Eric Hauswirth.", "answers": ["USMS mission areas include fugitive apprehension, witness protection, and federal prisoner transportation, among others. USMS whistleblowers recently alleged that USMS officials engaged in improper promotion practices—such as routinely preselecting favored candidates. Investigations have substantiated multiple whistleblower allegations which has raised questions about the integrity of USMS's merit promotion process. USMS announces about 260 law enforcement promotion opportunities annually. GAO was asked to review USMS's promotion processes and policies and effects that USMS promotion practices have on employee morale. This report examines (1) the extent to which the USMS's merit promotion policies are aligned with federal guidelines; (2) the extent to which USMS monitors its merit promotion processes; and (3) the steps, if any, USMS has taken to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion policies and processes. GAO analyzed data and documents on USMS promotions from October 2015 through April 2017, and found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of GAO's study. GAO also analyzed USMS documentation, and interviewed USMS officials and non-generalizable groups of employees (85 in total) in four district locations. The U.S. Marshals Service's (USMS) merit promotion policy aligns with relevant provisions in title 5 of the United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations, which are the government-wide laws and related provisions agencies must follow to make federal appointments. Agencies must design and administer merit promotion programs to ensure a systematic means of selection for promotion based on merit and these programs must conform to five key requirements outlined in title 5. GAO found that the USMS merit promotion plan, as revised in November 2016, aligned with each of these five requirements. For example, the first requirement states that agencies must establish merit-based procedures for promoting employees that are available in writing to candidates. The USMS merit promotion plan, which is available to employees, outlines such procedures. USMS is taking steps to improve how it monitors the implementation of the scoring component of its process to rate promotion applications, but lacks documented guidance to ensure consistent compliance with its merit promotion policy. GAO found that USMS does not adequately monitor the rating process, which allowed for conflicts of interest with raters who may compete with candidates whose applications they score. USMS also does not monitor the rating process to ensure that raters complied with a key requirement—that raters decline to score applications of candidates with whom there is a conflict of interest, such as a supervisor-employee relationship. USMS is implementing a process change that, if implemented effectively, can address these two deficiencies. The new process entails having a third-party contractor, rather than USMS employees, determine candidates' scores. Finally, GAO found that USMS lacks documented guidance on rater scoring. USMS only provides verbal guidance to instruct raters on how to score the experience category of merit promotion packages, creating inconsistent application of the guidelines. Employees GAO met with expressed the view that such discrepancies create the perception that the rating process is unfairly subjective. Developing clear and specific documented guidance on how raters should apply the benchmark guidelines could minimize scoring inconsistency and potential rater subjectivity for both the current rating process and the new competency-based assessment. USMS has taken limited steps to understand and address employee concerns about the promotion process. An estimated 41 percent of USMS respondents to the 2016 Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey strongly disagreed or disagreed that USMS promotions are merit-based, while 34 percent strongly agreed or agreed, and 25 percent neither agreed nor disagreed. During discussion groups GAO held at four USMS district locations across the U.S., employees frequently expressed negative views and many indicated low or no trust that the process is fair and merit-based. Although USMS has acknowledged employees' negative perceptions of the promotion process, it has not developed an agency-wide action plan in accordance with federal guidance to better understand the nature and causes of employee concerns across districts and divisions. Providing specific and consistent information to employees about key steps in the merit promotion process and internal management decisions could improve transparency and help mitigate employee perceptions of favoritism that have negatively impacted employee morale. GAO recommends that USMS develop specific rater guidance and develop and implement an agency-wide action plan to better understand and address employee concerns, among other steps. USMS concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 7304, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6dfde0e263206eb1653c11474298bbc3a9c4d1d2baab95b8"}
{"input": "", "context": "The purpose of federal banking supervision is to help ensure that banks throughout the financial system are operating in a safe and sound manner and are complying with banking laws and regulations in the provision of financial services. Banks in the United States are supervised by one of the following three federal regulators: FDIC supervises all FDIC-insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System and insured state savings associations and insured state chartered branches of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve supervises commercial banks that are state- chartered and members of the Federal Reserve System. OCC supervises federally chartered national banks and savings associations (also known as federal thrifts). FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC are required to conduct a full- scope, on-site examination of each of their supervised banks at least once during each 12-month period. The regulators may extend the examination interval to 18 months, generally for banks and thrifts that have less than $1 billion in total assets and that meet certain conditions, such as satisfactory ratings, are well capitalized, and are not being subject to a formal enforcement action. As part of a full-scope examination, examiners review a bank’s risk exposure within a number of components using the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, which also is referred to as the CAMELS rating system (capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk). Evaluations of CAMELS components consider a bank’s size and sophistication, the nature and complexity of its activities, and its risk profile. The end result of a full-scope, on-site examination is a report of examination, which includes the CAMELS ratings and other findings and is provided to the bank’s management and board of directors. A report of examination may include deficiencies or other issues that examiners found and that a bank is expected to address within specific time frames. Such issues generally are called supervisory recommendations by FDIC, supervisory findings by the Federal Reserve, and supervisory concerns by OCC. For purposes of this report, we collectively refer to such issues as supervisory concerns. Supervisory concerns may be designed to correct practices that deviate from sound risk management principles or noncompliance with laws and regulations. Supervisory concerns that involve more significant issues are brought to the attention of a bank’s board of directors and senior management in the report of examination as matters requiring immediate attention (MRIA) or matters requiring attention (MRA) under the Federal Reserve’s policies, matters requiring board attention (MRBA) under FDIC’s policies, and MRAs under OCC’s policies. If a bank were to fail to address a supervisory concern, its regulator could subject the bank to enhanced supervision, downgrade of a component or composite rating, or other supervisory actions, such as informal or formal enforcement actions. Under their 2006 guidance, regulators define CRE loans to include construction loans, loans to finance CRE that are not secured by CRE, loans secured by multifamily property, and loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential property in which the primary source of repayment derives from the rental income associated with the property or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. CRE loans in which the primary source of repayment is not the property itself are called owner-occupied loans and can include loans to businesses for working capital purposes that use real estate as collateral. For example, a line of credit for a business’s operating expenses might be secured in part by commercial property, such as an office. Construction and land development (CLD) loans generally are considered to be the riskiest class of CRE, due to their long development times and because they can include properties (such as housing developments or retail space in a shopping mall) that are built before having firm commitments from buyers or lessees. In addition, by the time the construction phase is completed, market demand may have fallen, putting downward pressure on sales prices or rents—making this type of loan more risky. Based on concerns about the increase in CRE concentrations at community banks and the risks associated with such concentrations, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC jointly issued guidance in December 2006 on CRE concentrations and sound risk management practices. The guidance described the regulators’ expectations for sound risk management practices for banks with concentrations in CRE loans. Specifically, the guidance identified seven key elements, or internal control areas, that a bank’s risk management practices should address to identify, monitor, and control its CRE concentration risk (see fig. 1). The 2006 CRE guidance also sets forth three criteria to identify banks with CRE loan concentrations that could be subject to greater supervisory scrutiny. According to the guidance, a bank that has experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, or is approaching or exceeds the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk: CLD concentration threshold: CLD loans represent 100 percent or more of a bank’s total capital. Total CRE concentration threshold: Total nonowner-occupied CRE loans (including CLD loans) represent 300 percent or more of a bank’s total capital and total CRE lending increased by 50 percent or more during the previous 36 months. According to the guidance, the CLD and CRE thresholds do not constitute limits on a bank’s CRE lending activity but rather serve as high-level indicators to identify banks potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. In 2011, we reported on how the federal banking regulators had responded to the potential risks of growing CRE concentrations at community banks, including by jointly issuing the 2006 CRE concentration guidance. We recommended that the regulators should enhance or supplement the 2006 CRE guidance and take steps to better ensure that such guidance is consistently applied. The regulators have taken steps to address our recommendation. Out of the approximately 5,900 banks that had a CRE loan portfolio as of the end of June 2017, a total of 504 banks exceeded either 100 percent in CLD loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital, or 300 percent in CRE loans as a percentage of total-risk based capital and had seen 50 percent CRE portfolio growth during the previous 36 months. Of these 504 banks, a total of 69 banks exceeded both the CLD criteria and the total CRE criteria (including the growth component). In December 2015, federal banking regulators issued a joint statement to remind banks of the 2006 regulatory guidance on prudent risk management practices for CRE lending activity through economic cycles. The regulators noted, among other trends, that many banks’ CRE concentration levels had been rising. According to the statement, regulators would continue to pay special attention to potential risks associated with CRE lending during 2016. Specifically, the regulators stated that when conducting examinations that include a review of CRE lending activities, they would focus on banks’ implementation of the prudent principles in the 2006 CRE guidance and other applicable guidance relative to identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing concentration risk in CRE lending activities. According to officials from FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC, their agencies use a variety of formal and informal processes to monitor the condition of banks and identify risks, including CRE concentration risk. For example, The Federal Reserve has a National Risk Council and FDIC and OCC have National Risk Committees that meet routinely to identify and evaluate risks facing banks and are supported by a number of other committees or other groups. FDIC officials told us that analysis done by FDIC’s Regional Risk Committees identified growth in CRE concentrations in 2015 and brought the issue to the National Risk Committee’s attention. OCC began actively monitoring CRE loan growth in the middle of 2014 and began focusing on CRE concentration risk management during bank examinations in 2015. OCC officials also stated that CRE concentration risk has been a key risk issue for the agency’s National Risk Committee since early 2016. Federal Reserve officials told us that the agency, including the Federal Reserve banks, began to monitor bank CRE concentrations more closely around mid-2013 after identifying an increase in CRE concentrations. According to FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC officials, they met together in early 2015 to discuss CRE lending growth and the rise in bank CRE loan concentrations and held subsequent meetings throughout the year, in part to discuss policy options for helping to ensure that banks were appropriately managing their CRE concentration risks. One of the outcomes of such interagency coordination was the December 2015 joint statement on CRE concentrations. Although the CRE sector has recovered since the 2007–2009 financial crisis, our trend and econometric analyses generally indicate that credit and other risks related to bank CRE lending have increased over the past several years. Based on indicators of CRE market conditions and loan performance, the CRE sector has recovered from the 2007–2009 financial crisis. For example, spending on CRE construction projects—a source of demand for bank financing—has rebounded. Vacancy rates for apartments, office buildings, and other CRE properties have declined. Similarly, as shown in figure 2, delinquency and charge-off rates on bank CRE loans have fallen from their post-crisis peaks and are at or below their lowest levels since 2002. Although these rates provide information on the current performance of bank CRE loans, they provide little or no information about potential future risks faced by banks. For example, high-risk loans made to less creditworthy borrowers could perform well when property markets and the economy are doing well but may perform poorly when property markets or the economy begin to slow. At the same time, our analyses of other market, underwriting, and lending data and forecasts from predictive econometric models we developed suggest that banks’ credit and concentration risks related to their CRE lending have increased. As shown in figure 3, according to a Federal Reserve survey, banks lowered their CRE loan underwriting standards— terms and conditions under which banks extend loans—after the financial crisis, but more banks began to tighten their underwriting standards since late 2015. In general, tightening underwriting standards may indicate that loan officers are reevaluating the degree of risk in CRE markets served by banks. According to Federal Reserve data, a larger share of banks has tightened underwriting standards on multifamily properties, such as apartments. CRE property prices, particularly for multifamily properties, have increased rapidly in recent years, and CRE property valuations have similarly increased. For example, as shown in figure 4, capitalization rates (the ratio of income generated by a property to the property’s price) on CRE properties have trended downward since around 2010—indicating that borrowers (i.e., property owners) may be earning less of a return on their CRE properties. Capitalization rates can be indicative of expected future price changes—for example, low capitalization rates may reflect expectations of future price increase, but can also be driven by investor sentiment not associated with fundamental aspects of properties. In addition, as shown in figure 5, the number of banks with concentrated portfolios in CLD or total CRE loans has been gradually increasing since around 2014. Greater concentrations in a particular lending sector (e.g., commercial real estate, residential real estate, or business lending) leave banks more vulnerable to a sectoral downturn, all else equal. To further assess risk in bank CRE lending, we developed and estimated several predictive models of aggregate losses on bank CRE loans. The models incorporate measures of CRE property prices, bank lending, and underwriting standards. The models generally found that, historically, higher future losses are predicted when CRE lending and prices are simultaneously high relative to gross domestic product, and when banks are tightening underwriting standards. Based largely on the simultaneous increase in bank CRE lending and CRE prices observed over the last several years, these models suggest that credit risk has increased, though it remains lower than the level of risk associated with the 2007– 2009 financial crisis. As we noted earlier, high property valuations and substantial increases in lending can simultaneously weaken collateral protections and indicate lower borrower quality, both of which can raise the risk of losses should the economy or CRE sector weaken. (See app. II for additional information on our models.) We found that regulators generally subjected banks with relatively high concentrations in CRE loans to greater supervisory scrutiny in comparison to banks with relatively lower concentrations in CRE loans in our review of 54 examinations for 40 banks conducted from 2013 through 2016. In all of these examinations, the regulators specifically assessed whether each bank had adequate risk management practices and capital for managing its CRE concentration risk and generally found that the banks had adequate risk management practices and capital. In a few examinations, regulators differed in how they addressed supervisory concerns about a bank’s CRE-related risk management practices. In our review of a nongeneralizable sample of 54 examinations conducted from 2013 through 2016, we found that FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC subjected banks with relatively high concentrations in CRE loans to greater supervisory scrutiny. In both their 2006 CRE guidance and 2015 CRE statement, the regulators indicated that banks with relatively high CLD or total CRE concentrations should maintain risk management practices commensurate with the level and nature of their concentration risk. The 2006 CRE guidance recognized that the sophistication of a bank’s CRE risk management practices depends on, among other things, the level and nature of its CRE concentrations and associated risk. As noted earlier, the guidance notes that a bank’s risk management practices should address seven internal control areas: (1) board and management oversight; (2) portfolio management; (3) management information systems; (4) market analysis; (5) credit underwriting standards; (6) portfolio stress testing and sensitivity analysis; and (7) credit risk review function. Based on our analyses, we found that the 2006 CRE guidance’s risk management framework is adequately designed to help ensure that banks effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control their CRE concentration risk. For example, the guidance is consistent with credit and concentration risk principles issued by international standard- setting bodies. Of the 54 reports of examination that we reviewed, 41 of them covered banks whose CLD or total CRE concentrations exceeded the CLD concentration threshold, total CRE concentration threshold, or both thresholds set forth in the 2006 guidance. In all of these examinations, we found that FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC examiners generally assessed whether each bank had implemented adequate risk management practices to manage their concentration risk. As shown in figure 6, in 26 of the 41 examinations, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC examiners did not find any weaknesses in the banks’ CRE risk management practices across the seven internal control areas, but did find weaknesses in the remaining 15 examinations. In 15 of the 41 examinations we reviewed, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC examiners found the banks had CRE-related risk management weaknesses in at least one of the seven internal control areas. Examiners most frequently found risk management weakness in three internal control areas: board and management oversight (11 instances), management information systems (8 instances), and stress testing (7 instances). To a slightly lesser extent, examiners found weaknesses in portfolio management, credit underwriting standards, and credit risk review function. Examiners communicated their supervisory concerns to these 15 banks in their reports of examinations. In 12 of the examinations, examiners included MRAs, MRBAs, or MRIAs in their reports of examination that directed the banks to correct their risk management weaknesses. In the other three examinations, examiners included recommendations or other notes in their reports of examination that generally directed the banks to correct their risk management weaknesses. Consistent with the 2006 CRE guidance, we found that examiners generally did not use the CLD or total CRE concentration thresholds as limits on bank CRE lending. With two exceptions, examiners did not direct banks that exceeded the CLD or CRE threshold to reduce their concentrations but rather focused on ensuring that the banks’ risk management practices were commensurate with the nature and level of their concentration risk. In the two exceptions, examiners found the banks’ practices and capital inadequate for managing their CLD or CRE concentration risk and directed the banks to reduce their concentrations and improve their risk management practices. We found that FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC examiners varied in the extent to which they documented—in the reports of examination and supporting workpapers—the scope of their review of banks’ CRE-related risk management practices and findings. For example, we were not always able to determine whether examiners found a bank’s practices adequate in one or more of the seven internal control areas based on our review of the report of examination and, if available, supporting workpapers. According to the regulators, reports of examinations are used primarily to document practices found to be inadequate and not practices found to be adequate. Moreover, the regulators told us that their examiners recently have been required to use a CRE examination module to document their assessment and findings of banks with concentrations exceeding the CLD or CRE threshold. In the 41 examinations we reviewed where banks exceed one of the concentration thresholds, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC examiners assessed whether the banks generally had capital commensurate with their CRE concentration risk. In 34 of the examinations, examiners determined that the banks’ capital levels were adequate for managing their CLD or total CRE concentration risk. In 7 of the examinations, examiners determined that the banks’ capital levels were inadequate. For six of the seven banks, examiners directed the banks in the reports of examination to reduce or manage their CRE concentrations in light of inadequate capital. In the case of one bank, examiners required the bank to comply with a previous formal enforcement action that addressed the need for the bank to adhere to its board-approved capital plan. For banks with relatively high CLD or total CRE concentrations, we found that Federal Reserve and OCC examiners assessed the banks’ CRE- related risk management practices in subsequent examinations. In our review of 41 examinations of banks that exceeded the CLD or CRE threshold, 26 of them covered two examination cycles of 13 banks conducted from 2013 through 2016. We found that examiners assessed the banks’ practices for managing their concentration risk in both examinations. In 14 examinations (covering 7 banks), examiners found that the banks had adequate risk management practices in both examinations. In six examinations (covering three banks), examiners found aspects of the banks’ risk management practices to be inadequate in their 2013 or 2014 examination and noted their supervisory concerns in the reports of examination. In the subsequent examinations, the examiners found that the banks had adequately addressed the previously identified risk management weaknesses. In six examinations (covering three banks), examiners found the banks’ practices for managing their CRE concentration risk to be adequate in the 2013 or 2014 examinations but inadequate in the subsequent examinations. The examiners issued the banks MRAs or MRIAs or took an informal enforcement action. For banks with concentrations below the CLD or total CRE threshold, we found that regulators generally did not examine the banks’ CRE-related risk management practices. Thirteen of the 54 examinations we reviewed covered banks that did not exceed the CLD or CRE thresholds. Although the banks did not exceed either threshold, OCC examiners assessed the banks’ CRE-related risk management practices in 3 of the examinations. In 1 examination, examiners determined that the bank’s CRE-related risk management practices were adequate. The other 2 examinations covered subsequent cycle examinations of the same bank. In the first examination, examiners found that the bank had adequate practices for managing risk associated with its CRE loans but directed the bank through an MRA to incorporate stress testing of the loan portfolio into its monitoring. In the subsequent examination, the examiners found that the bank had addressed the MRA. In the other 10 examinations, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC examiners did not mention in the report of examination the banks’ practices for managing the risk associated with their CRE loans. FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC officials told us that examiners use their professional judgment in determining whether to review a bank’s CRE-related risk management practices if the bank’s concentration is below the CLD and CRE threshold. This approach is consistent with the overall risk-based supervisory process used by the regulators, which focuses examiner resources on assessing bank management’s ability to identify and control risks. For example, FDIC’s examination guidelines note that examiners should focus their resources on a bank’s highest risk areas when assessing risk management programs, financial conditions, and internal controls. According to the guidance, the exercise of examiner judgment to determine the scope and depth of review in each functional area is crucial to the success of the risk-focused supervisory process. In a few examinations, we found differences across regulators in how they addressed supervisory concerns about banks’ CRE-related risk management practices because of differences in the regulators’ policies. In our nongeneralizable sample of 54 examinations, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC examiners included CRE-related supervisory concerns, such as recommendations, MRAs, or MRBAs, in 22 of the reports of examinations. Although the regulators have policies for identifying and communicating supervisory concerns, their policies use different criteria. For example, OCC’s policies instruct examiners to use MRAs to describe practices that a bank must implement or correct to address a deficiency and not to use MRAs to require enhancements to bank practices that meet acceptable standards. However, the Federal Reserve’s and FDIC’s policies do not expressly include such criteria. Consistent with their policies, OCC examiners included MRAs in the reports of examination that we reviewed only when they found a bank’s CRE-related risk-management practices to be inadequate. In contrast, in 2 reports of examination, we found that FDIC examiners did not find the banks’ CRE- related risk management practices to be inadequate but included MRBAs to direct the banks to enhance or sustain certain CRE-related risk management practices. Similarly, in 1 report of examination, Federal Reserve examiners found that the bank’s risk management practices and capital were adequate for its CRE concentrations but included an MRA to require the bank to enhance its capital plan to include concentration risk considerations. In addition to their examinations, federal banking regulators have taken informal and formal enforcement actions against banks for not adequately managing their CRE concentration risk. In general, initial consideration and determination of whether informal or formal action is required usually results from examination findings. Unlike informal enforcement actions, formal enforcement actions are published or publicly available. From 2013 through 2016, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC took formal enforcement actions against banks for not adequately managing risks related to their CRE concentrations, including those outlined in the jointly issued 2006 CRE guidance. FDIC took 22 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters related to their CRE concentrations during this period. The Federal Reserve took 2 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters related to their risk management of CRE lending. OCC took 11 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters related to their CRE concentrations during this same period. The majority of these formal enforcement actions discussed the 2006 CRE guidance and directed the banks to improve their practices for managing their CRE concentration risk. For example, in a number of formal enforcement actions, the regulators ordered the banks to revise their written concentration risk management programs for identifying, monitoring, and controlling risks associated with concentrations of credit, consistent with the 2006 CRE guidance. We provided a draft of this report to FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and, OCC for review and comment. The agencies provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC.

Our objectives in this report were to examine: (1) trends in the commercial real estate (CRE) lending markets, including changes in the level of credit and concentration risk in the markets, and (2) actions federal banking regulators took through their examinations to help ensure that banks with CRE concentrations are effectively managing the related risks. To examine trends in the CRE lending markets, we reviewed academic literature and prior GAO work and interviewed officials from the federal banking regulators and private data providers. Specifically, we interviewed officials at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to help identify potential indicators of risk in CRE markets. To further inform our assessment of risk, we reviewed prior GAO work on the lessons learned from prior banking crises and the use of early warning models for monitoring the financial system. We also reviewed academic research on early warning models of banking and real estate-related crises. To report trends and assess risk, we reviewed and analyzed a range of data that we considered to be reflective of various aspects of risk in CRE lending markets. Specifically, we reviewed and analyzed commercial property vacancy data from REIS (a private commercial real estate data provider); commercial property construction data from the U.S. Census Bureau; data on delinquencies and charge-offs on bank CRE loans from the Federal Reserve; data on commercial property prices and capitalization rates from Real Capital Analytics (a private commercial real estate data provider); FDIC data on bank CRE lending; and Federal Reserve data on underwriting standards. We evaluated trends in these data and used a subset of these data to estimate several predictive models of aggregate losses on bank CRE loans. (See app. II for more information on our predictive models.) To examine actions taken by federal regulators to help ensure that banks with high CRE concentrations are effectively managing the related risks, we reviewed and analyzed their relevant guidance and regulations on bank CRE lending, examination policies and procedures (e.g., examination manuals and modules), studies and other publications on risks in the banking industry, and formal enforcement actions taken from 2013 through 2016 for CRE-related matters. In addition, we analyzed Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income data from SNL Financial for the period from 2011 through 2016 to calculate banks’ construction and land development (CLD) and CRE concentrations during the period. Specifically, we used the concentration formulas in the 2006 CRE concentration guidance (jointly issued by the federal banking regulators) to calculate banks’ CLD and CRE concentrations and identify banks whose CRE concentrations exceeded, in full or in part, the guidance’s CRE concentration thresholds during part or all of the time frame. Based on whether the banks’ CRE concentrations exceeded the thresholds and other criteria discussed below, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 40 banks overseen by FDIC, the Federal Reserve, or OCC. For the banks in our sample, we requested from the regulators copies of the reports of examination and, if available, related workpapers prepared by the regulators based on their full-scope examinations of the banks done from 2013 through 2014, and from 2015 through 2016. In addition to using banks’ CRE concentrations as a basis to select examinations, we judgmentally selected a nonprobability sample of banks based on the following criteria: Total asset size: We considered the size of the banks based on their total assets and selected banks from each of the following three ranges: (1) banks with $1 billion or more in total assets, (2) banks with $100 million or more but less than $1 billion in total assets, and (3) banks with less than $100 million in total assets. Primary regulator: We considered the primarily regulator of the banks and selected a sample of 40 banks that resulted in a total of 20 examinations to review from each regulator. Geographic distribution: We selected banks to ensure that at least one bank was from each of the four regions of the U.S. Census and each of the nine divisions within those regions. Based on the 40 banks we selected, we reviewed and analyzed 54 reports of examination and, if available, the related workpapers. We analyzed the examinations using criteria or other requirements specified in the 2006 CRE guidance jointly issued by the regulators and their examination policies and procedures. We did not review six examinations of banks supervised by the Federal Reserve. We also interviewed officials from FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC, and from a national banking association about bank CRE lending and applicable CRE guidance and requirements. For the data we analyzed under both of our objectives, we took a number of steps to assess the reliability of the data, including interviewing data providers; corroborating trends across multiple data sources; reviewing related documentation; inspecting data for missing values, outliers, or other errors; and reviewing relevant, prior GAO work. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting objectives. We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to March 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We developed and estimated several models of aggregate losses on bank commercial real estate (CRE) loans. These models attempt to predict future aggregate charge-offs using contemporary indicators of potential risks. We incorporated indicators of risk based on the cross- country research literature on early warning models of banking risk and prior GAO work on identifying early warning models as tools that could assist financial regulators in assessing risk. One study summarized the overall intuition for models of this class in the following way: “imbalances manifest themselves in the coexistence of unusually rapid cumulative growth in private sector credit and asset prices.” Our results were consistent with this concept and extend the aggregate early warning model literature to a sectoral model. As such, our models incorporate measures of CRE property prices, bank lending volumes, and bank loan underwriting standards. The models predict charge-offs 2–3 years into the future (the dependent variable is the average charge-off rate for 8 through 11 quarters into the future), using commercial bank charge-off rates from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), first quarter 1991 to second quarter 2017. (See below for an illustrative regression equation for one of these models.) We began with two model variations, one based on the levels of key variables and the other based on their growth rates, using the following independent variables, respectively: “Level” model: Level of CRE prices to gross domestic product (GDP), level of bank CRE lending to GDP, the interaction of the level of CRE prices and lending, and the net percentage of banks tightening underwriting standards on CRE loans. “Growth” model: Growth rate of CRE prices over the last year, growth rate of bank CRE lending over the last year, interaction of price and lending growth, and the net percentage of banks tightening underwriting standards on CRE loans. By inspection, the model based on levels also captured key aspects of the evolution of aggregate losses on bank CRE loans in recent decades—for example, low charge-offs prior to the crisis, the rapid increase during crisis, and very low charge-offs in recent years. In this model higher losses are predicted by tightening underwriting standards, and the interaction of (i.e., simultaneous increase in) the level of CRE prices and the level of CRE lending. The bulk of the explanatory power of the model appears to come from the interaction of the level of CRE prices and the level of CRE lending—consistent with Borio and Drehmann’s view that the coexistence of rapidly increasing credit and prices is associated with greater risk. These results are also consistent with a more general theory, for example, that periods of economic stability induce greater risk-taking over time, bidding up asset prices and loosening underwriting standards until ultimately increased valuations become unsustainable, prices fall, and borrowers begin to default. We estimated a number of additional models for robustness, to determine if goodness-of-fit and forecasts could be improved markedly, and to assess the degree of forecast uncertainty. For example we estimated a model with a censored dependent variable and used information criteria to select models that combined elements from our initially separate models based on growth rates and levels as well as a model that includes current charge-offs. In figure 7, we report the general trend in expected future charge-offs as well as convey forecast uncertainty based on differences in the forecasts of three of these models. In figure 8, we convey forecast uncertainty based on the 75 percent confidence interval for a combined model that we selected based on information criteria. Implicit in this exercise is the assumption that the data-generating process is reasonably stable—as a result, structural change associated with new financial products, new risk management tools, and new legal and regulatory frameworks could reduce the stability of the data- generating process. We interpret our results and forecasts in light of these potential limitations. Specifically, we do not interpret model results as concrete, precise predictions of aggregate commercial real estate losses but rather as an additional, general indication of the degree of risk in bank CRE lending. We mitigate risks associated with estimating this type of model with appropriate diagnostics, out-of-sample testing, and by developing the model in the context of the well-established early warning literature. That said, some inevitable limitations remain, including the potential omission of important risk factors and other approximations associated with our specification (e.g., our choice of a linear functional form). In addition, diagnostics for detecting nonstationary time series are imperfect, especially with small sample sizes, which may inflate our measures of statistical significance and traditional goodness-of-fit measures like r- squared. These biases may be present, however, in models that still generate useful predictions. In this “small data” context there is also risk of fitting (or over-fitting) the model to predict a particular credit event— though, again, this risk is mitigated somewhat in the context of the broad cross-country early warning literature and the use of out-of-sample testing.

The guidance includes two CRE thresholds that regulators use to identify banks that are potentially exposed to significant CRE concentration risk and could be subject to greater supervisory scrutiny. Concentrations in CRE loans at U.S. banks have been steadily increasing—raising safety and soundness concerns. In December 2015, the regulators jointly issued a public statement to remind banks of the 2006 CRE guidance. In light of the joint 2015 statement and GAO's ongoing monitoring of regulatory efforts to identify and respond to emerging threats to the banking system, GAO examined (1) trends in the CRE lending market, including changes in risk, and (2) actions taken by regulators to help ensure that banks with CRE concentrations are effectively managing the related risks. To address these issues, GAO analyzed CRE-related data; reviewed agency policies and guidance; and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 54 bank examinations conducted from 2013 through 2016 based on the banks' CRE concentrations, total assets, primary regulator, and geographic location. GAO also interviewed officials from the federal banking regulators. While the commercial real estate (CRE) sector has recovered since the 2007–2009 financial crisis, GAO's trend and econometric analyses generally indicate that risk in CRE lending by banks has increased over the past several years. Since the early 2000s, community banks have tended toward providing CRE loans more than other kinds of loans. Indicators of CRE market conditions and loan performance have been improving since 2011. At the same time, GAO's analyses of changes in CRE underwriting standards, property prices, and other data suggest that credit and concentration risks have increased in bank CRE lending. For example, the number of banks with relatively high CRE concentrations—measured by the ratio of a bank's CRE loans to its total capital—has been increasing. In addition, commercial property prices have been increasing rapidly, and property valuations also have risen in recent years. Similarly, GAO's predictive econometric models of CRE loan performance suggest that risk has increased, based largely on the simultaneous increase in bank CRE lending and CRE prices observed over the last several years, but is lower than the level associated with the 2007–2009 financial crisis. GAO found that federal banking regulators subjected banks with relatively high CRE concentrations to greater supervisory scrutiny based on its review of a nongeneralizable sample of 54 bank examinations covering 40 banks done by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency from 2013 through 2016. Of the 54 examinations that GAO reviewed, 41 of them covered banks with relatively high CRE concentrations. In all of these examinations, regulators examined whether the banks had adequate risk management practices and capital to manage their CRE concentration risk. In 26 of the 41 examinations, regulators did not find any risk management weaknesses. However, in 15 of the 41 examinations, regulators found the banks had weaknesses in one or more risk management areas, such as board and management oversight, management information systems, or underwriting. The regulators generally communicated their findings to the banks in the reports of examination and directed the banks to correct their risk management weaknesses."], "length": 6306, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8308db40d49c17134ee09bf6be699889b81b1b1b63c15199"}
{"input": "", "context": "Risk management, as applied to security of federal facilities, entails a continuous process of applying a series of mitigating actions—assessing risk through the evaluation of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences; responding to risks with appropriate countermeasures; and monitoring risks using quality information (see fig. 1). In 1995, Executive Order 12977 established the ISC after the bombing of the Oklahoma City Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in April 1995. The ISC’s mandate is to enhance the quality and effectiveness of security in and protection of federal facilities in the United States occupied by federal employees for nonmilitary activities. The order directs the ISC to develop and evaluate security standards for federal facilities, develop a strategy to ensure executive agencies and departments comply with such standards, and oversee the implementation of appropriate security measures in federal facilities. The ISC has released a body of standards, including the ISC Standard, designed to apply to the physical security efforts of all federal, non-military agencies. The ISC Standard prescribes a process for agencies to follow in developing their risk assessment methodologies (see fig. 2). Most federal departments and agencies are generally responsible for protecting their own facilities and have physical security programs in place to do so. The ISC Standard requires executive departments and agencies to follow the risk-management process when conducting risk assessments for each of their facilities. That process begins with determining the facility security level, ranging from level I (lowest risk) for facilities generally having 100 or fewer employees to level V (highest risk) for the most critical facilities and generally having greater than 750 employees. The security level designation determines the facility’s baseline countermeasures. For each facility, departments and agencies are required to (a) consider all of the “undesirable events” that could pose a risk to their facilities— such as active shooters, vandalism, and explosions—and (b) assess three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) to specific undesirable events. Subsequently, agencies are to combine all three factors to yield a measurable level of risk for each undesirable event (see app. III). Based on the results of these assessments, agencies should customize (either increase or decrease) the countermeasures to adequately reflect the assessed level of risk. In addition, as part of planning for physical security resources within an agency’s budget process, the ISC has identified the need to balance allocations for countermeasures with other operational needs and with competing priorities. The ISC Best Practices have some similarities with leading practices in capital decision-making. For example, both state that the allocation of resources should be integrated into the agency’s mission, objectives, goals, and budget process. However, beyond the ISC Best Practices, the Office of Management and Budget and we have developed more comprehensive leading practices in capital decision- making that provide agencies with guidance for prioritizing budget decisions such as for countermeasure projects. The Office of Management and Budget and our guidance also emphasize evaluating a full range of alternatives, informed by agency asset inventories that contain condition information, to bridge any identified performance gap. Furthermore, the guidance calls for a comprehensive decision-making framework to review, rank, and select from among competing project proposals. Such a framework should include the appropriate levels of management review, and selections should be based on the use of established criteria. The following describes the mission and physical security program characteristics for the agencies in our review: CBP, the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, has responsibility for securing the country’s borders. It also has responsibility for conducting security assessments at about 1,200 facilities, including approximately 215 federally owned and agency-controlled higher-level facilities (facility security levels III and IV). These facilities include border patrol stations with holding cells for people detained at the border, office buildings, and canine-training centers. CBP conducts these assessments. FAA’s mission is to provide a safe and efficient aerospace system for the country. According to agency data, FAA has 55 federally owned and agency-controlled higher-level facilities—including critical air traffic control towers. According to FAA officials, FAA specialists conduct security assessments. ARS conducts research related to agriculture and disseminates information to ensure high-quality safe food and to sustain a competitive agricultural economy. According to agency data, ARS has security responsibility for four domestic federally owned and agency- controlled higher-level facilities—including laboratories for research to improve food and crop quality, office buildings, and warehouses. ARS security personnel have responsibility for conducting security assessments. The Forest Service sustains the health, diversity, and productivity of the nation’s forests and grasslands. According to agency officials, the Forest Service has one federally owned and agency-controlled higher- level facility—a regional headquarters office building. The Forest Service’s security officials have responsibility for conducting security assessments, but at the time of our review, USDA security officials conducted the assessment at Forest Service’s one higher-level facility. None of the four selected agencies’ security assessment methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard. The ISC gives agencies some flexibility to design their own security-assessment methodologies for identifying necessary countermeasures as long as the chosen methodology adheres to fundamental principles of a sound risk- management methodology. Specifically, methodologies must: consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to federal facilities, and assess three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) for each of the events. Furthermore, the ISC Standard requires executive departments and agencies to document decisions that deviate from the ISC Standard. Agencies’ policies and methodologies reference the ISC Standard. However, none of the agencies’ methodologies considered all of the undesirable events during assessments although they used some type of risk assessment methodology. In addition, the agencies did not always adhere to these principles of risk management (see table 1). At the time of our review, CBP’s methodology did not fully align with the ISC Standard because it did not consider all of the 33 undesirable events nor assess threat and consequence. CBP security specialists assessed vulnerabilities at building entrances and exits, in interior rooms, and around the perimeter using a yes/no checklist during the assessment process. However, assessment reports showed that specialists did not assess the threats and consequences of undesirable events at each facility. According to security officials, the gap occurred because they designed the checklist to meet requirements in the 2009 CBP Security Policy and Procedures Handbook, which predates the first edition of the ISC Standard issued in 2010. CBP officials told us that as of January 2017, they began using an improved methodology to assess the threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences for 30 of 33 undesirable events— omitting three now identified in the November 2016 revision to the ISC Standard. However, CBP has not yet updated its handbook to align with the ISC Standard, even though it started this effort over 3 years ago in December 2013. CBP officials did not provide a draft of its updated handbook, but they provided a plan with milestone dates for issuing the handbook by September 2018. CBP officials also told us that updates to the handbook may have to wait due to competing priorities, including efforts to address the backlog of assessments (which we discuss later in this report). Delays in updating the handbook mean that CBP’s policy will continue to not align with the ISC Standard. Furthermore, although CBP security officials told us that all of the agency’s security specialists have been trained to use the improved assessment methodology, without documentation of the methodology in agency policy, there may be greater risk of its inconsistent application. Standards for Internal Control emphasize the importance of agencies developing and documenting policies to ensure agency-wide objectives are met. Documentation serves to retain institutional knowledge over time when questions about previous decisions arise. Without an updated policy handbook that requires a methodology that assesses all undesirable events consistent with the ISC Standard, CBP cannot reasonably ensure that its facilities will have levels of protection commensurate to their risk. FAA’s methodology does not fully align with the ISC Standard because it does not consider all of the 33 undesirable events nor does it assess all three factors of risk. FAA security specialists assess vulnerabilities to the site perimeter, entryways, and interior rooms using a yes/no checklist, but the checklist does not assess the consequences from each of the undesirable events at each facility. With respect to threat, FAA applies the ISC’s baseline threat—a general federal facilities threat level that relates directly to a set of baseline countermeasures—across all its higher-level facilities because FAA policy states that there is no agency-specific threat that exceeds the current baseline threat. According to FAA officials, the baseline threat standardizes the security needs across their facilities rather than addressing the security needs of individual facilities from specific threats. When necessary, FAA policy allows specialists to modify countermeasures based on an evaluation of conditions at the facility. FAA realized that this approach was no longer appropriate given the agency-wide goal to make risk-based decisions, a review of the assessment process after a 2014 Chicago fire incident that destroyed critical FAA equipment, and an awareness of ISC initiatives to assess compliance. To address the resulting methodological gaps, FAA hired a contractor to design, develop, test, and validate an improved risk- assessment methodology. Subsequently, FAA improved its methodology in January 2017 to assess the threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences for 30 of the 33 undesirable events identified in the November 2016 revision to the ISC Standard —and tested the methodology at lower- and higher-level facilities. This revised methodology addresses the need to assess individual facility needs rather than using a standardized baseline approach. In April 2017, FAA officials told us of their plan for implementing this methodology and provided tentative milestone dates to conduct further testing, training, and analysis before deciding to use the improved methodology, which they expect to complete by January 2018. However, their plan lacks the necessary information to ensure successful implementation, such as detail on how many facilities they will test and how they will use the results of testing, training, and analysis to implement the improved methodology within the identified 9-month time frame. Furthermore, the improved methodology does not address undesirable events for which ISC issued countermeasures in May 2017. Without a detailed implementation plan to assess the methodology’s impact on its security program, FAA cannot reasonably ensure that its facilities have the proper countermeasures. With ongoing changes to its security program, FAA has an opportunity to fully align its improved methodology with the ISC Standard by including all 33 undesirable events and to update its policy requiring the use of such a methodology. Unlike CBP and FAA—which developed their own methodologies separate from their parent departments (Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Transportation (DOT), respectively)— ARS and the Forest Service follow an assessment methodology developed by USDA. USDA’s methodology does not fully align with the ISC Standard because it does not consider all of the 33 undesirable events for which ISC issued countermeasures in May 2017. Security specialists from USDA headquarters typically assess ARS’s and the Forest Service’s higher-level facilities using a risk-based methodology that considers the 31 undesirable events listed in the previous version of the ISC Standard dated August 2013. However, until recently, USDA did not assign ratings to each of the three risk factors—threat, vulnerability, and consequence—and then combine these ratings to yield a measurable level of risk for each undesirable event. USDA security officials said that they have revised the assessment-reporting format to include this risk calculation and trained their specialists to measure risk in this way. USDA officials provided us with a new assessment template that addresses all 33 undesirable events and includes measuring risk. Additionally, USDA officials said that they are revising their outdated physical security manual and expect to complete it by April 2018. With a revised manual and application of the new assessment template, USDA should be better positioned to assess risk at its facilities. When agencies do not use methodologies that fully align with the ISC Standard, they could face deleterious effects, ranging from facilities having inappropriate levels of protection to agencies having an inability to make informed resource allocation decisions for their physical security needs. Specifically, the ISC Standard states that facilities may face the effect of either having (1) less protection than needed resulting in inadequate security or (2) more protection than needed resulting in an unnecessary use of resources. The ISC Standard also states that these effects can be negated by determining the proper protection according to a risk assessment. Identified excess resources in one risk area then can be reallocated to underserved areas, thus ensuring the most cost- effective security program is implemented. As an illustration of such potential effects, we found that two agencies assessing two higher-level facilities came to two different conclusions in terms of their need for X-ray machines to screen for guns, knives, and other prohibitive items in federal facilities. Specifically, one agency based its decision on a policy that does not deviate from the ISC’s baseline set of countermeasures, and the other agency based its decision on professional judgement that deviated from the ISC’s baseline set of countermeasures. Neither agency based its decision on a risk assessment nor documented its decision—both ISC requirements, specifically: Without conducting a risk assessment, FAA recently expanded a policy requirement calling for all higher-level facilities to have X-ray machines and magnetometers. This new requirement poses a potentially sizeable investment for the agency with an estimated cost of X-ray machines of about $24,000 and magnetometers of about $4,000 each. FAA may need such equipment at all its higher-level facilities. However, the ISC Standard requires that agencies conduct risk assessments first to justify their needs. Without conducting risk assessments, FAA managers could unnecessarily use resources by installing such equipment in all higher-level air traffic facilities when there may be higher priority needs A USDA security specialist decided, despite an ISC baseline requirement that higher–level facilities have X-ray machines, not to recommend an X-ray machine at a higher-level Forest Service facility. The specialist reasoned that unlike other federal buildings with numerous unknown visitors, this facility receives mostly known individuals and a limited number of visitors. The ISC Standard allows for professional judgement; however, the ISC requires that agencies document deviations from the baseline set of countermeasures. Reducing the facility’s level of protection without documenting an assessment of risk could result in no record of the basis of the decision for current and future facility managers and security officials to review or use as justification in the case of a question of compliance. In another case, we found that one higher-level facility did not have access control for employees or visitors nor did it have armed guard patrols. The facility manager told us that intelligence and a history without incidents gave leadership reason to believe that these measures were not needed and that therefore the agency did not require and would not fund such protective measures for this facility—in effect, accepting the risks to the facility. Security officials said they also had the same understanding and did not document the matter in the assessment report even though agency policy and the ISC Standard require written documentation when officials deviate from the baseline requirement. Without security assessments that fully align with the ISC Standard and provide measureable levels of risk, agencies do not have the information they need to determine priorities and make informed resource allocation decisions. For example, they may not be able to assess whether to acquire or forego costly physical-security countermeasures—such as, X- ray machines, access control systems, and closed-circuit television systems—for facilities. Additionally, after determining the need to acquire a countermeasure, agencies must fund the countermeasure. As previously discussed, leading practices in capital decision-making include a comprehensive framework to review, rank, and select from competing project proposals for funding. In conducting risk assessments that do not fully align with the ISC Standard (i.e., not assessing threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences and measuring risks), agencies miss the opportunity for more informed funding decisions. Three of the four agencies (CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service) currently prioritize funding for operational needs over physical security needs (see table 2) when agencies’ priorities might be different if they based their decisions on an aligned risk assessment. Standards for Internal Control state that agencies should use quality information on an ongoing basis as a means to monitor program activities and take corrective action, as necessary. The ISC requires that agencies assess higher-level facilities at least once every 3 years—an interval requirement to identify and address evolving risks. We found that three of the four agencies (CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service) did not meet this requirement. Officials reported various challenges including (1) assessments competing with other security activities, (2) an insufficient number of qualified staff to conduct assessments when compared to the number of facilities, or (3) not knowing of the required assessment schedule. An “information system” is the people, processes, data, and technology that management organizes to obtain, communicate, or dispose of information. that had not been reassessed since 2010. CBP security officials attributed the backlog to (1) having too few security specialists assigned to assess about 1,200 facilities and (2) the specialists working on competing priorities, such as revising the security handbook, conducting technical inspections, and reviewing new construction designs and renovation projects. According to CBP security officials, they have developed a plan to eliminate the backlog by the end of fiscal year 2018 by prioritizing the completion of assessments. While we found the plan comprehensive, the schedule did not seem feasible. For example, the plan assumes that one specialist can complete six assessments in 3 consecutive days and that another specialist can complete three assessments in 1 day. In contrast, security officials told us specialists take about 20 work hours (or 2½ days) to conduct an on-site assessment of one facility. CBP officials said that they believe they can meet the time frames of the plan because they have set aside other priorities and have a thorough understanding of the scope of work involved at the facilities. They added that it will not be easy to meet the timeline, but they can accomplish it with a motivated and committed workforce, adequate financial resources, and absent activities that would otherwise require shifting of resources. We question the feasibility of setting aside important priorities, such as updating the policy manual and reviewing physical security elements in new construction designs, as well as the workload assumptions for completing the assessments. Further, these other priorities are also key to securing facilities. Without balancing assessments with competing priorities, CBP’s time frames for completing the assessments by the end of fiscal year 2018 may not be feasible and may also result in the agency’s not addressing other important physical security responsibilities. Since the ISC issued its standard in 2010, ARS and the Forest Service have assessed their higher-level facilities at least once. However, these agencies have not reassessed all of their higher-level facilities within the 3-year interval requirement. Specifically, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. The ARS headquarters official explained that the agency had not reassessed the two facilities due to competing priorities and insufficient internal resources. During the course of our review, ARS headquarters officials said they began assessing one of the two ARS facilities in May 2017 and will begin assessing the second facility in October 2017. The Forest Service official explained that the agency missed its security reassessment of the regional office because the facility staff had not requested one. During our visit, facility staff responsible for security told us that they were not aware of the ISC’s 3- year interval requirement. Facility staff requested a reassessment, and security officials told us that they expected to complete it by mid-June 2017. Completing this one-time assessment may address the facility’s security needs temporarily. However, ARS and the Forest Service have not implemented a long-term schedule with key milestones and lack a means to monitor completion of assessments of higher-level facilities at least once every 3 years. Consequently, these agencies cannot reasonably ensure that they have full knowledge of the risks to their facilities. FAA data from 2010 through 2016 show that FAA has assessed its 55 higher-level facilities at least once every 3 years. FAA policy requires that specialists schedule assessments of higher-level facilities every 12– 18 months depending on whether the facility has met FAA physical security standards. The ISC Standard states that to make appropriate resource decisions, agencies need information, such as what is being accomplished, what needs management attention, and what is performing at expected levels. We found that agencies’ methods of collecting and storing security information had limitations that affected agency and facility officials’ oversight of the physical security of their facilities (see table 3). Without having long-term, agency-wide information to monitor whether assessments are conducted on schedule, ARS and the Forest Service may not meet the ISC Standard, resulting in not adequately protecting their facilities and employees. The ISC Standard also states that agencies should measure their security program’s capabilities and effectiveness to demonstrate the need to fund facility security and to make appropriate decisions for allocating resources. However, the agencies in our review were unable to demonstrate appropriate oversight of their physical security programs because: CBP’s handbook does not include requirements for data collection and analysis for monitoring physical-security program activities. Facility managers and security officials do not enter assessment results, such as the countermeasures recommended for facilities, in the real property database. Consequently, they do not have comprehensive data to manage their security program, assess overall performance, and take any necessary corrective actions. A CBP official told us that a comprehensive database would allow CBP to set priorities for addressing countermeasures. Without including data collection and analysis requirements in its updated handbook, CBP may be unable to monitor the performance of its physical security program. FAA’s policy does not require ongoing monitoring of physical security information, such as the status of recommended countermeasures or assessment schedules. As a result, FAA officials do not proactively use physical security information to assess the overall performance of its physical security program and take corrective actions before an incident occurs. Without a policy requiring ongoing monitoring of information—an internal control activity, FAA may be unable to assess the overall performance of its security program and take necessary corrective actions. USDA has a decentralized security program and places the responsibility on agencies to create their physical security programs. Security officials from ARS and the Forest Service told us that USDA does not have a policy for collecting and managing agency-wide information; however, they said that USDA is drafting a new departmental regulation and manual that will specify (1) the roles and responsibilities of agency and facility managers and (2) electronic- data-reporting requirements for monitoring the performance of the physical security program. USDA officials provided a draft of USDA’s regulation and manual for our review. The draft regulation did not mention data reporting and monitoring, while the draft manual only contained a table of contents that included a section entitled “Facility Tracking Database.” USDA officials expect to issue new policies sometime between October 2017 and April 2018. In the absence of new departmental regulation and manual, USDA and Forest Service officials told us that they have begun to develop a Forest Service system for storing electronic copies of agency-wide assessments and that they plan to expand the use of this system to track site specific assessment dates and status of recommended countermeasures. Forest Service officials provided milestone dates and described the capabilities for a future information system, which they expect to complete in September 2017. However, we could not determine whether the manual will have information system requirements to monitor agencies’ physical security program, an internal control activity. Without USDA’s including data collection and analysis requirements in its manual, its agencies may not be able to monitor the performance of their physical security programs. Without agencies having information to monitor security activities, they were unable to provide us information on the status of countermeasures across their entire portfolio. In order to better understand the status of countermeasures implemented and facilities’ experiences when implementing countermeasures, we determined the status of countermeasures at 13 facilities we visited. As previously noted, risk management, as it pertains to physical security, involves agency officials monitoring their physical security programs. During our visits to 13 selected facilities, we found the four agencies differed in the number of countermeasures that they had not implemented. Facility officials provided us with some information on why countermeasures had not been implemented, specifically: CBP had a significant number of recommended countermeasures from 2010 through 2016 that remained open at the eight selected CBP facilities. CBP facility officials gave reasons why recommended countermeasures had not been implemented. At one facility, officials did not know about the recommended countermeasures from its last 2010 assessment because the individuals previously knowledgeable about the assessments left the organization without communicating the results. By taking action to improve facility security, they implemented some needed countermeasures. However, at the time of our review, a large number of the recommendations remained open. At another facility, officials told us that they too had not known (for the same reason mentioned above) of their 2010 assessment, which contained recommended countermeasures. However, these officials told us that they submitted a funding request a few weeks before our visit to address all except one of the open countermeasures. In other cases, facilities have not implemented needed countermeasures due to resource constraints or physical site limitations. FAA had a large number of recommended countermeasures from 2010 through 2016 that remained open at the time of our review for the two FAA facilities visited. In this case, the most recent security assessment, completed in late 2016, resulted in one facility’s having little time to implement countermeasures by the time we conducted our analysis. While ARS had closed almost all recommended countermeasures at two facilities at the time of our review, one Forest Service facility had not yet implemented a recommendation (to secure its entrance doors) that was identified in a 2013 security assessment (see bottom center photo, fig. 3). This countermeasure remained open because facility officials said they continued to explore alternatives to address the recommendation. Figure 3 shows examples of countermeasures not fully implemented at selected facilities we visited. During our site visits and discussions with facility staff, we found that physical site limitations or other priorities can make it difficult for facility managers to implement countermeasures. For example, a countermeasure might involve correcting a clear zone violation—that is, moving an object (such as a brick wall) a certain distance away from the facility’s perimeter fence to prevent a potential intruder from using the object to climb over the fence. However, when the object near the fence is a building and the property outside of the fence is not federally owned (see bottom right photo, fig. 3), it may not be cost effective to correct the clear zone violation. In this situation, the agency bears the responsibility for exploring ways to address the vulnerability. In following the ISC Standard, as previously noted, managers are required to justify and document why they could not implement recommended countermeasures—what the ISC calls risk acceptance. Selected agencies carry a great responsibility for protecting facilities that support border protection activities, provide safe and efficient air traffic around the country, and protect the quality of the nation’s food supply. With this responsibility comes the need to appropriately assess risk to ensure the security of these agencies’ facilities. However, 7 years after the ISC issued its initial risk-management process standard, each of four selected agencies continued to use assessment methodologies that did not fully align with this standard. During our review, agencies improved their methodologies to better align with the ISC Standard, but the agencies had not yet incorporated the methodologies into their policies and procedures. Without updated policies and procedures requiring a methodology that adheres to the ISC Standard (including all 33 undesirable events now identified in the November 2016 revision to the ISC Standard), agencies may not collect the information needed to assess risk and determine priorities for improved security. This situation could hamper the agencies’ ability to make informed resource allocation decisions or to recommend countermeasures commensurate to the needs at specific facilities. To address challenges in conducting timely assessments, agencies that had a backlog developed plans to address them, but the assumptions used in CBP’s plans and time frames did not appear to fully reflect the agency’s competing priorities and actual experience. Additionally, ARS and Forest Service have not implemented a long-term assessment schedule with key milestones to ensure that higher-level facilities are reassessed at least once every 3 years. Further, in cases where the agencies may have had risk assessment information, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service lack the means to collect, store, and analyze this information in order to monitor the status of a facility’s security. Without these key aspects of a comprehensive security program—a methodology that meets the standard, policies, and procedures that incorporate that methodology; the ability to complete assessments on time; and information to perform monitoring—agencies remain vulnerable to substantial security risks. To improve agencies’ physical security programs’ alignment with the ISC Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for information and monitoring, we recommend that the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection take the following three actions: with regard to the updated Security Policy and Procedures Handbook, the ISC’s Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities requirement to assess all undesirable events, consider all three factors of risk, and document deviations from the standard, and data collection and analysis requirements for monitoring the performance of CBP’s physical security program. revise the assumptions used in the plan to address the backlog to balance assessments with competing priorities, such as updating the policy manual and reviewing new construction design, to develop a feasible time frame for completing the assessment backlog. Secretary of Transportation direct the FAA Administrator to take the following three actions: develop a plan that provides sufficient details on the activities needed and time frames within the date when FAA will implement an improved methodology; update FAA’s policy to require the use of a methodology that fully aligns with the ISC’s Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities for assessing all undesirable events, considering all three factors of risk, and documenting all deviations from the standard countermeasures; and update FAA’s policy to include ongoing monitoring of physical security information. Secretary of Agriculture take the following two actions: include data collection and analysis requirements for monitoring the performance of agencies’ physical security programs, in the department’s revised physical-security manual, and direct the Administrator of the Agricultural Research Service and the Chief of the Forest Service to implement and monitor a long-term assessment schedule with key milestones to ensure that higher-level facilities are reassessed at least once every 3 years. We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, and Agriculture for review and comment. All three departments agreed with the findings and recommendations for their respective agencies. DHS agreed with our recommendations and provided actions and timeframes for completion. With regard to our recommendation to update the Security Policy and Procedures Handbook, DHS stated that CBP is updating the handbook to include: (1) a discussion and diagram of the ISC risk management process and its application within CBP’s assessment processes; (2) specific guidance for conducting risk assessments in accordance with the ISC’s Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities; and (3) a requirement and guidance for data collection and analysis in support of a robust physical security program. With regard to our recommendation to revise the assumptions used in the plan to address the assessment backlog, DHS stated that CBP has reevaluated current priorities and believes the current plan to eliminate the risk assessment backlog by the end of fiscal year 2018 is achievable. DHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DHS’s official written response is reprinted in appendix IV. DOT also agreed with our recommendations and by e-mail requested that we publish the response to the sensitive version of this report. DOT stated that FAA continues to refine its policy and develop processes that address the ISC threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Further, DOT stated that FAA would either validate that current mitigation strategies address those risks or apply additional appropriate countermeasures. DOT stated that it will provide a detailed response to each recommendation within 60 days from the date of this report. DOT’s official written response is reprinted in appendix V. USDA agreed with our recommendations and provided the agency-wide actions for completion. USDA provided a plan to ensure compliance with the ISC’s Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities by development of a standard physical-security assessment process and by initiation of a compliance program to track assessments and monitor the installation of countermeasures. In an e-mail, USDA provided milestone dates and planned completion by January 2019. USDA’s official written response is reprinted in appendix VI.

This report examines: (1) how selected agencies’ assessment methodologies align with the Interagency Security Committee’s (ISC) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. To determine how selected agencies’ assessment methodologies align with ISC standards for identifying the necessary countermeasures, we identified federal executive branch departments and agencies reported by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to have received delegations of authority to protect their own buildings. We reviewed the Federal Real Property Council’s data on the Federal Real Property Profile to identify federally owned and agency-controlled buildings. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our reporting objectives based upon our recent report that reviewed these data fields. We selected four agencies based upon their large quantity of reported federally owned and agency-controlled buildings: DHS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and USDA’s United States Forest Service (Forest Service). This methodology purposely does not include federal buildings protected by FPS and under the control of the General Services Administration as well as other agencies that we reported on in our previous work. We obtained and reviewed one particular ISC standard, The Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities (the ISC Standard) and its related appendices for assessing physical security and providing recommended countermeasures at federal facilities. We obtained and analyzed the selected departments’ and agencies’ facility-security policies and procedures for a risk assessment methodology. According to the ISC Standard, agencies’ risk assessment methodologies must: consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to federal facilities as listed in appendix III; assess the threat, consequences, and vulnerability to specific produce similar or identical results when applied by various security provide sufficient justification for deviations from the ISC-defined security baseline. We limited the scope of this review to the first two standards above because agencies’ adherence to these standards could be objectively verified by reviewing and analyzing agency documentation and interviewing agency officials, and their adherence to the two additional standards could not be verified in this manner. We did not conduct risk assessments with independent security professionals to evaluate: 1) the results from prior agency evaluations and 2) the sufficiency of justifications for deviations from the ISC-defined security baseline, as both evaluations were outside of the scope of the engagement. Therefore, for the purposes of this report, risk assessment policies, procedures and resulting methodology that align with ISC standards are those that consider all of the undesirable events and assess the threats, consequences, and vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events. We reviewed and analyzed information to answer the following five questions: 1. Do the policies and procedures mention the ISC standards? 2. Do the policies and procedures consider all of the undesirable events? 3. Do the policies and procedures assess the threat of specific undesirable events? 4. Do the policies and procedures assess the consequences of specific undesirable events? 5. Do the policies and procedures assess the vulnerability to specific undesirable events? We answered each of these questions as either a “Yes” or “No” for our selected agencies. The “No” answer to questions 3, 4, and 5 includes the following two possibilities: (a) the agency’s threat, consequence, or vulnerability ratings are not tied to specific undesirable events, or (b) the agency does not have a framework or formalized steps within which it collects and analyzes threat-, consequence-, or vulnerability-related information. If the answer to each of the five questions was “Yes,” then the agency’s overall risk assessment methodology aligns with ISC risk assessment standards for the purposes of this report. If the answer to one or more of the five questions was “No”, then the agency’s methodology does not to align with ISC standards for the purposes of this report. We interviewed security officials at ISC; three departments (DHS, DOT, and USDA); and four agencies (CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service). We obtained and analyzed agency guidance on prioritizing physical security needs and interviewed agencies’ facility maintenance and budget officials. We reviewed the ISC’s best practices for planning for physical security resources within an agency budget process. Additionally, we reviewed the Office of Management and Budget’s and our leading practices in capital decision-making that provide agencies with guidance for prioritizing budget decisions such as “countermeasure projects.” We also reviewed Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government because internal controls play a significant role in helping agencies achieve their mission-related responsibilities. Our findings from our review of the selected agencies are not generalizable to all ISC member agencies, but provide insight into and illustrative examples about selected agencies’ facility risk-assessment methodologies. To determine what management challenges selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring results, we interviewed agencies’ security, maintenance, and budget officials. We requested agency security officials to provide portfolio- wide data on facility security assessments for our review in order to select sites to visit and analyze data for dates of assessments and the status of findings. We assessed the reliability of this data through interviews with knowledgeable agency staff and a review for completeness and any unexpected values. We compiled information from physical security assessments when no portfolio-wide agency data were available. We determined that these data were sufficient for the purpose of our reporting objectives and selected geographically dispersed sites with buildings with higher reported security levels per the ISC Standard, as these higher security levels have greater requirements and therefore the potential for greater resource needs. See appendix II for the 13 sites we selected. For these selected sites, we interviewed agency staff concerning the assessment process, site-specific findings, recommendations, justification for deviations from ISC’s baseline standards, and management challenges faced in addressing physical security needs. We observed and photographed the status of the findings from the site physical security assessments. We did not independently determine what constitutes a management challenge or a physical security finding. Rather, we relied on these stakeholders to determine these physical security concerns as defined in their own standards and guidance. The information from our selected sites is illustrative and cannot be generalized to sites agency- wide. The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted from June 2016 to August 2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate, evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We subsequently worked with DHS, DOT and USDA from August 2017 to October 2017 to prepare this version of the original report for public release. This public version was also prepared in accordance with these standards. Error! No text of specified style in document. Error! No text of specified style in document.

Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs. All four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations."], "length": 7405, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "dde4c26d473a17c454c5c730561ec833a66d7b0ebe936520"}
{"input": "", "context": "Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. States administer their Medicaid programs within broad federal rules and according to a state plan approved for each state by CMS. CMS issues program requirements in the form of regulations and guidance, approves changes to states’ Medicaid programs, provides technical assistance to states, and conducts other oversight activities. States are responsible for establishing state policies and procedures in accordance with federal requirements. Each state must designate a single state agency to administer its Medicaid program. That agency can delegate programs or functions—such as enrollment in HCBS programs—to other state and local agencies, but is responsible for their supervision. States may provide certain types of HCBS under their state plans. In addition, states may seek permission from CMS to provide HCBS under waivers of traditional Medicaid requirements; for example, in order to provide services to a targeted population or to a limited number of beneficiaries. Both state plans and waivers are developed and proposed by states and must be approved by CMS in order for states to receive federal matching funds for medical expenditures. Medicaid HCBS cover a wide range of services and supports to help individuals remain in their homes or live in a community setting, such as personal assistance with daily activities, assistive devices, and case management services to coordinate services and supports that may be provided from multiple sources. With approval from CMS, states can provide Medicaid HCBS under one or more types of programs authorized under different sections of the Social Security Act, including several state plan and waiver authorities. (See table 1.) States can have multiple HCBS programs operating under different authorities, and these authorities have distinct features such as different functional eligibility criteria. For example, some types of Medicaid HCBS programs only serve beneficiaries who are functionally eligible for an institutional level of care; that is, beneficiaries must have needs that rise to the level of care usually provided in a nursing facility, hospital, or other institution. Under some types of HCBS programs, states can tailor their programs to the needs of specific beneficiary populations they choose to target. Common populations that states target with their HCBS programs include: older adults and people with physical disabilities, people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people with addictions or mental illness, and other populations with specific conditions such as traumatic brain injury or Alzheimer’s disease. States use different delivery systems to provide Medicaid HCBS, and these may vary across distinct HCBS programs within a state. Historically, states have predominantly provided HCBS using fee-for- service delivery systems in which states pay providers for HCBS rendered to beneficiaries and billed to the state. Alternatively, under managed care long-term services and supports delivery systems, states contract with managed care plans to provide HCBS to beneficiaries and typically reimburse the plans through capitation payments, which are periodic payments for each beneficiary enrolled under the contract. Managed care plans may contract with HCBS providers to provide services to beneficiaries or may provide services directly. A state may use a combination of fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems within or among its HCBS programs. Estimated expenditures on HCBS provided under managed care have grown from $8 billion in fiscal year 2012 to $19 billion in fiscal year 2015. Individuals require HCBS because they are limited in their ability to care for themselves due to physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, or to chronic conditions. These services can assist beneficiaries with activities of daily living—basic, personal, everyday activities such as bathing, dressing, and eating—or with instrumental activities of daily living, which are other activities that allow individuals to live independently in the community, such as meal preparation or managing finances. States generally assess a beneficiary’s needs for HCBS based on designated assessment tools—or sets of questions—that assessors use to collect information from sources such as beneficiaries, caregivers, and health records. Examples of this information include the following: Functional support needs: The need for assistance with activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living. Clinical care needs or medical health concerns: Information on an individual’s health history, active diagnoses, medications, and clinical services (e.g., wound care or dialysis). Cognitive and behavioral support needs: The loss of memory function, behaviors that pose risks, or adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Beneficiaries’ strengths, preferences, and goals. The needs assessment processes may vary across states and distinct HCBS programs within a state, but typically involves the following key steps: States direct potentially eligible individuals to entities that conduct Medicaid HCBS needs assessments. An assessor conducts a needs assessment, generally in a face-to- face setting, using a designated assessment tool to collect information based on methods such as interviews with beneficiaries and caregivers, observation, and review of other sources of information needed to determine functional eligibility for services. Additional information relevant for service planning purposes may be included in this needs assessment, or collected in additional assessments that may occur after an individual is determined eligible for HCBS. Needs assessment results are used to inform determinations of whether an individual meets particular HCBS programs’ functional eligibility requirements. Needs assessment results for eligible individuals inform the development of a service plan. The service plan includes the type and amount of services to be provided to the beneficiary within state- specified limits. States may use distinct needs assessments for service planning to collect more detailed information or may use the same assessment that was used to determine functional eligibility. (See fig. 1.) CMS’s goals for HCBS and other Medicaid long-term services and supports include achieving a sustainable and efficient system that provides appropriate services to beneficiaries. Effective needs assessments can help beneficiaries to receive appropriate services to help them live independently and help states manage utilization of services, and therefore costs. An effective assessment process would facilitate efficient use of services and beneficiaries’ access to available services appropriate to their needs by accurately and consistently estimating beneficiaries’ needs. Assessment processes that overestimate needs, underestimate needs, or both, may result in HCBS programs that offer more services than needed or deny eligible beneficiaries access to needed services. (See fig. 2.) There are varied reasons why HCBS needs assessments may not accurately and consistently estimate beneficiaries’ needs. HCBS needs assessments cover complex subject matter and may require assessors to make observations and judgments about beneficiaries’ needs. For example, needs assessments typically address numerous and varied tasks necessary for a beneficiary to live independently, which can be difficult to measure and subject to interpretation—such as a beneficiary’s ability to manage finances. Furthermore, CMS has stated that assessors’ conflicts of interest can influence decisions even without individual assessors realizing this. Conflicts of interest can arise when an assessor has an incentive for a beneficiary to either over- or under-utilize HCBS, or an incentive to put the needs of assessors ahead of program goals, such as promoting certain HCBS when others may be more beneficial or cost effective. As examples to further illustrate these points, incentives that could result in over- or under-utilization of HCBS include the following, respectively. On one hand, an assessor may be a provider of the services for which the beneficiary may be eligible or a managed care plan that covers these services, and thus have an incentive to find that individuals need the services or coverage they offer. Conversely, a managed care plan may have incentives to reduce enrollees’ service utilization in order to reduce costs below the capitation payments that the plan receives to provide care to its enrollees and thus to maximize its profits, which could influence needs assessments used for service planning. Each of the six selected states we reviewed used varied needs assessment tools across their distinct Medicaid HCBS programs, for which both functional eligibility criteria and amount of services available to beneficiaries can differ widely. The selected states varied in the extent to which their needs assessment tools were either tailored to a single Medicaid HCBS program or used across multiple, though not necessarily all, HCBS programs in the state. The selected states also varied in the extent to which the same or different needs assessment tools were used for different purposes, such as determining functional eligibility and developing a service plan: Connecticut. State officials reported that the state was in the process of piloting a uniform needs assessment tool that it planned to use for all but one of the Medicaid HCBS programs in the state. This needs assessment tool was used both to determine functional eligibility and to develop beneficiary service plans. Kentucky. State officials reported that the state had implemented a new needs assessment tool for one Medicaid HCBS Waiver program while continuing to use previous tools for other Medicaid HCBS Waiver programs. The same assessment was used for determining functional eligibility and for developing the service plan. In selecting and adapting the new tool, officials said that they considered the assessment needs of the other Medicaid HCBS waiver programs, because they would ultimately like to use only one assessment tool across all HCBS Waiver programs. Minnesota. State officials reported that the state had designed a uniform needs assessment tool for use across all HCBS programs in the state and had implemented it for most programs. The uniform assessment tool was used to determine functional eligibility for all HCBS programs in the state for which it was implemented and was also used to inform the development of service plans. New York. State officials reported that the state had implemented a set of needs assessment tools, referred to as a uniform assessment system, for use across multiple HCBS programs. The same uniform assessment system was used to both determine functional eligibility and to inform development of beneficiary service plans. North Carolina. At the time of our review, officials described generally using different assessment tools for the separate HCBS programs in the state. State officials reported that the state had developed a new needs assessment tool for one Medicaid HCBS Waiver program, and that they planned to expand use of this tool to another program in the future. The state used different needs assessments to determine functional eligibility and for service planning in its HCBS Waiver programs. Washington. State officials reported that a uniform assessment system was used across HCBS programs in the state. The system was composed of multiple needs assessment components. One version of the assessment was used for HCBS programs serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and a different version was used for all other programs. For all HCBS programs, the same needs assessment system was used to determine functional eligibility and to develop the service plan. All six states we studied reported using more than one type of entity to conduct needs assessments for HCBS programs. For example, New York used five different types of entities, North Carolina used four different types of entities, and the remaining four states used two or three types of entities to conduct needs assessments. State agencies, local public agencies, and independent contractors were used by four states to conduct needs assessments for at least one HCBS program. All states but one, Washington, used HCBS providers or managed care plans to conduct needs assessments (see table 2). The types of entities that conduct needs assessments in the selected states varied across distinct HCBS programs, or for distinct needs assessment purposes within a single HCBS program. States may use multiple types of entities to conduct needs assessments because of differences in how particular HCBS programs were delivered. For example, the entities used in Minnesota varied by delivery system—the state reported that it used local public agencies to conduct needs assessments for all Medicaid HCBS programs other than its managed care HCBS program, for which managed care plans conducted needs assessments. In other states, different entities conducted needs assessments within the same HCBS programs depending on the purpose of the assessment. For example, because managed care plans may have a financial interest in eligibility determinations, New York began by July 2015 to use an independent contractor exclusively to conduct needs assessments to determine functional eligibility for HCBS for new enrollees in its managed care HCBS program. Once individuals were determined eligible for managed care HCBS, the managed care plans conducted the same assessment a second time in order to develop beneficiary service plans. The six selected states also varied in whether they used formulas based on information collected using Medicaid HCBS needs assessment tools to inform key functional eligibility and service planning decisions. States may use such formulas as a means of meeting goals of consistent treatment of individuals based on needs. In making functional eligibility determinations, five of the six selected states—Connecticut, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, and Washington—reported using a formula to compare the results of completed needs assessments to eligibility criteria for at least one of the HCBS programs in the state. For example, for specific HCBS programs, the assessment tool may compile results of certain assessment questions into a score that indicates whether or not the beneficiary is considered to have a need for an institutional level of care, which is required in order to be functionally eligible for some types of HCBS programs. For service planning purposes, four states— Connecticut, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Washington—reported that in at least one of these states’ distinct HCBS programs, the assessment tools included formulas. These formulas specified a particular amount of services or guided a potential range of service amounts for beneficiaries based on the results of particular assessment questions. (See table 3.) Professional judgment may also be used in conjunction with formulas. For example, when formulas are used to specify particular service levels based on the needs assessment results, they may specify a number of service hours or service budget. In either case, other factors may also be considered in some circumstances. State officials in one state described the use of formulas to allocate services as an initial step prior to the detailed person-centered service planning process. For example, in Minnesota a state formula specifies a certain number of hours of personal care services partly based on the level of need for assistance with activities of daily living such as eating, bathing, and toileting. However, the beneficiary and the entity responsible for the service planning process determine the specific services to prioritize within the overall number of hours available, and they may decide to use the authorized hours toward covered services that were not necessarily part of the formula, such as instrumental activities of daily living. In contrast, in states or HCBS programs that did not utilize formulas to specify or guide a particular amount of services based on assessment results, the amount of services may be determined—within the scope of service limits applicable to the particular HCBS program—by the entity responsible for working with the beneficiary on the service planning process. The six selected states reported taking steps to unify needs assessment processes across Medicaid HCBS programs as a means of meeting goals such as improving the efficiency and effectiveness of assessments. Specifically, states reported taking steps to implement assessment tools for use across multiple Medicaid HCBS programs in the state. Four states—Connecticut, New York, Minnesota, and Washington—had adopted or were piloting needs assessment tools that were used across multiple state Medicaid HCBS programs (though not necessarily all such programs in the state) rather than completing separate needs assessments for each separate program. In addition, Kentucky and North Carolina had recently implemented new tools for specific Medicaid HCBS programs that would be considered for use in additional HCBS programs in the future. Important benefits to beneficiaries and HCBS programs have resulted from efforts to coordinate needs assessment processes by using a uniform assessment across distinct HCBS programs, according to state officials and advocates. For example: State officials and advocates described that using a uniform assessment tool to determine functional eligibility for multiple state HCBS programs resulted in benefits and efficiencies for beneficiaries. Officials and advocates in Minnesota said that the uniform assessment process allowed beneficiaries to connect with the program best suited to their needs, even if they may not have otherwise been aware of it when initially seeking assistance. For example, officials said that families of children with autism may apply for personal care services, but may benefit more from being connected to another HCBS program that is available and designed to support the children’s specific needs. Similarly, officials in Connecticut said that uniform assessment across HCBS programs allows beneficiaries to access the services that are most appropriate without multiple assessments. For example, if an individual applies for a particular HCBS program but a separate program would be more appropriate, a second assessment is not necessary. Connecticut, Washington, and New York officials described how uniform assessment tools allowed consistent information to be shared with care providers or when beneficiaries transitioned between care settings. This, in turn, could allow care providers to better manage beneficiary care. State officials reported uniform assessment tools can result in better informed program management and policy decisions because they allow for the ability to collect consistent information across HCBS programs. For example, officials from Connecticut and Washington described how comparable assessment information could inform equitable policies for allocating services. Washington officials described using information about the extent of beneficiary needs to inform decisions about how many program staff were needed. Kentucky officials described how a more uniform assessment process helped them become aware of when beneficiaries were receiving services from multiple different non-Medicaid HCBS programs that were state-funded. States and advocates also reported challenges, including inefficiencies, to using uniform assessments under certain circumstances, such as when states have different criteria for functional eligibility across their different HCBS programs, or when different beneficiary populations have different assessment needs. For example: Minnesota officials reported that beneficiaries may need to address multiple versions of similar eligibility-related questions in its uniform assessment tool. This was due to the decision to incorporate each HCBS program’s previously separate functional eligibility questions into its tool to avoid changes in the information they used to determine eligibility. Beneficiary advocates in three states expressed concerns with the use of assessments designed for a particular population on a different population, such as using assessments designed for adults to assess the needs of children. Officials from Kentucky also noted concerns about using assessments across distinct populations as part of the reason the state was not using a single assessment tool. State officials and advocates also reported that uniform assessments resulted in lengthier assessment question sets that take longer to complete for both the assessor and the beneficiary. Selected states reported making efforts to improve their assessment processes to increase consistency in how assessors conduct HCBS needs assessments. These efforts included using structured questions and emphasizing training to ensure individual assessors approached the assessment questions consistently and according to policy, and addressing potential conflicts of interest by using independent assessors rather than HCBS providers and managed care plans to conduct certain needs assessments. States’ improvement efforts included the following: Structured questions. Officials from five states described that structured approaches to assessment questions could improve the consistency of the assessment results, which are used to make functional eligibility and service planning decisions. Examples of structured questions that state officials described included questions that limited responses to a specific time period—such as the past 7 days—when assessing needs, and questions that used a standard scale for responses. Assessor training. Officials from four states reported focusing on assessor training to improve consistency. For example, North Carolina officials reported that determinations of need for personal care services were improved after training. In the training, assessors were taught to comply with a state policy to ask that beneficiaries demonstrate need for assistance with activities of daily living, such as mobility, rather than solely asking them questions about their needs. Independent needs assessments. Officials from three of the selected states—New York, North Carolina, and Kentucky—reported that needs assessments were improved by removing entities that had a financial interest in assessment results from conducting certain assessments. For example, Kentucky officials reported that using independent assessors rather than HCBS providers enhanced consistency because HCBS providers may skew beneficiaries’ assessment results to generate demand for their services. They noted that providers had resisted their removal from the process. Three of the six selected states reported that using a formula to summarize assessment results increased the consistency with which functional eligibility determinations or decisions about the amount of services to provide were made based on each individual’s assessment results. For example, officials from Washington reported that after implementing a formula to generate an overall classification of need, the amount of service hours authorized for beneficiaries was distributed more equitably and evenly across a continuum from minimum to maximum, rather than beneficiaries mainly always receiving the maximum number of hours allowed under program limits. This could allow for limited resources to be allocated more consistently across beneficiaries with similar levels of need. Officials from Connecticut similarly reported that during testing of a formula that was planned for use to specify the amount of service to provide, they had identified beneficiaries receiving more services than would be indicated by the formula based on their assessed needs. While officials reported that these efforts enhanced consistency of eligibility determinations and service authorization decisions, state officials and advocates also acknowledged challenges related to balancing consistency with flexibility in arriving at decisions—particularly with respect to the use of formulas for service allocation. The different approaches of relying on a formula or relying on the judgement of individual entities each presented its own challenges: In two states where there was a formula to specify or guide the amount of services to provide, advocates raised concerns that the indicated amount did not adequately address needs for some individuals. For example, advocates noted that the results of a lengthy and nuanced assessment tool were ultimately reduced to a single score in order to inform a particular budget for services. While this score might reflect the average needs of beneficiaries with similar assessment results, it did not adequately convey individualized needs of some beneficiaries, according to the advocates. On the other hand, there were concerns that relying on entities’ judgment resulted in inconsistency across beneficiaries. Advocates in three states raised concerns about inconsistent decisions across managed care plans or geographic areas, or over time, when determinations of functional eligibility or amount of services to provide were not based on state-determined formulas. In one state, state officials and advocates noted that these concerns were addressed by using formulas to allocate services but allowing beneficiaries to use an alternative assessment process in certain circumstances or receive “exceptions” to the amount of service authorized by the state’s formula based on individual circumstances. Beneficiary advocates also emphasized that the amount of services that are authorized for beneficiaries may reflect the scope of available services rather than the needs of an individual beneficiary. To the extent that a given HCBS program has limited resources for providing services, assessment results may be used to allocate resources within those limitations rather than to estimate the amount of services that would fully meet needs. For example, an assessment formula in Washington is designed to specify service amounts based on beneficiaries’ identified levels of need and the amounts that are available for particular levels of need may increase or decrease based on the state budget. State officials in Connecticut also said that because funding can vary for different HCBS programs within a single state, moving to a consistent formula for analyzing assessment results may shed light on the extent that beneficiaries with similar levels of need receive different levels of services depending on available program resources. CMS has implemented two key programs that facilitate state efforts to make their HCBS needs assessment processes more uniform, among other goals. One of these is called Testing Experience and Functional Tools (TEFT) and is designed, in part, to test the effectiveness of a set of specific questions that states can use to conduct needs assessments. CMS designed the TEFT assessment questions for use across multiple HCBS beneficiary populations, including beneficiaries (1) of advanced age, or with (2) intellectual or developmental disabilities, (3) physical disabilities, (4) serious mental illnesses, or (5) traumatic brain injuries. The assessment questions being tested are limited to needs that may be relevant among these populations and do not assess needs that may apply to only certain populations; for example, questions to assess cognitive status that may apply to those with intellectual or developmental disabilities or other conditions but that do not apply to those with physical disabilities only. CMS announced TEFT in 2012 and six states received grants to test needs assessment questions for their effectiveness, which includes their validity (defined as accuracy in measuring individuals’ functional abilities) and reliability (defined as the consistency of results across assessors). Three of these six states were among those we selected for this review: Connecticut, Kentucky, and Minnesota. Officials in these states told us that they had not completed field testing the TEFT questions, and officials in two of these states (Connecticut and Minnesota) said they would consider the option of using TEFT questions in their assessments in the future. CMS officials told us that CMS plans to make the assessment questions they determine to be valid and reliable available to all states in the spring of 2018. Another key program that CMS has implemented is the Balancing Incentive Program, which was authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, to provide incentives for eligible states to rebalance their long-term services and supports systems towards more home- and community-based care. Among other things, this program required participating states to collect information on specific topics related to beneficiaries’ needs, but allowed states to choose the needs assessment questions. Under this program, states could use different assessment tools to gather information for HCBS programs serving different populations as long as the states used tools that collected information on 26 key topics that spanned five broad areas, or domains. The five domains were (1) activities of daily living, (2) instrumental activities of daily living, (3) medical conditions/diagnoses, (4) cognitive functioning, memory, and learning, and (5) behavior concerns (e.g., injurious, uncooperative, or destructive behavior). The requirement to collect information from these five domains for each beneficiary population was designed to promote consistency in determining beneficiaries’ needs across HCBS programs, while allowing states to tailor their assessment processes to specific beneficiary populations, according to CMS officials. For example, New York reported collecting information on the required topics using a suite of six assessment tools that varied to reflect differences in beneficiaries’ age, population, and other factors. The Balancing Incentive Program ended in 2015, although some states were provided extensions to carry out planned activities. Of 20 participating states evaluated, 18 successfully carried out the requirement to incorporate the 26 key topics in their needs assessments, according to a program evaluation prepared for the HHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. In addition, CMS has provided information and lessons learned from the Balancing Incentive Program to all states via its website and, according to CMS officials, has done several related presentations. While CMS does not have plans to conduct additional evaluations of assessment tools used by participating states, CMS officials told us that there would be some value to doing so and they may consider it in the future. CMS has sought to improve HCBS needs assessments by addressing concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest that HCBS providers and managed care plans may have in conducting assessments. As previously noted, HCBS providers may have a financial interest in providing services that could potentially lead to over-utilization of services, while managed care plans may have a financial interest in increasing enrollments and reducing enrollees’ service utilization. CMS has taken steps to address conflicts of interest that may occur when HCBS providers conduct needs assessments, but gaps remain. The Balancing Incentive Program, which ended in 2015, required the 21 participating states to either separate HCBS provision from needs assessment processes or to take steps to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest that occur when HCBS providers conduct assessments. In addition, CMS implemented regulations requiring all states to establish standards for conducting needs assessments that address certain potential conflicts for particular types of HCBS programs. The specific requirements may differ by program and whether the assessment is used to determine functional eligibility or develop service plans: For example, for State Plan HCBS—a relatively small program that accounted for less than 1 percent of estimated Medicaid HCBS expenditures in fiscal year 2015—states are required to establish conflict-of-interest standards that address both (1) evaluation of eligibility, and (2) needs assessments used to develop service plans. These standards must prohibit HCBS providers from conducting eligibility evaluations and needs assessments for this program, with certain exceptions in which the potential for conflict of interest must be mitigated. Under the HCBS Waiver, Community First Choice, and Self-Directed Personal Assistant Services programs—which collectively accounted for 60 percent of estimated expenditures for Medicaid HCBS in fiscal year 2015—states are required to establish standards that generally prohibit HCBS providers from conducting assessments of need used to develop service plans, but this requirement does not apply to assessments that states may use to determine functional eligibility. In addition, for State Plan Personal Care Services programs and other HCBS authorized under Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act— which collectively accounted for 29 percent of estimated Medicaid HCBS expenditures in fiscal year 2015—regulations do not specifically limit HCBS providers from conducting assessments that states may use to determine eligibility or develop service plans. As a result of these differences in requirements across HCBS authorities, there are gaps in federal conflict-of-interest requirements applicable to entities that may conduct needs assessments. For example, several types of HCBS programs have specific requirements for states to establish standards to address potential conflicts of interest when HCBS providers conduct needs assessments that are used for service planning, but there are no equivalent requirements for State Plan Personal Care Services programs. (See table 4). In addition, HCBS providers may conduct certain needs assessments that inform HCBS functional eligibility determinations, but specific conflict of interest requirements are generally not in place for such assessments. With respect to gaps in requirements specific to needs assessments that are used to inform functional eligibility determinations, CMS officials suggested that state agencies’ responsibility for making final eligibility determinations addresses conflict- of-interest concerns. Specifically, officials noted that CMS regulations require state agencies to determine eligibility, and that, in doing so, states may consider needs assessments conducted by assessor entities as well as information from other sources. However, states may vary in the extent to which they consider information from other sources. In addition, it is unclear how the requirement that the state maintain responsibility for eligibility determinations addresses potential conflicts of interest when an HCBS provider conducts a needs assessment upon which a determination of eligibility for HCBS may be based. Gaps in requirements to address the potential for conflicts of interest when HCBS needs assessments are conducted by HCBS providers are not consistent with federal internal control standards, which require federal agencies to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. While CMS has a goal of achieving an effective long-term services and supports system that provides appropriate services to beneficiaries, because the agency does not require states to address the potential for HCBS providers’ conflicts of interest in conducting needs assessments under all HCBS authorities, there is a risk that some states may rely on HCBS providers to conduct assessments without addressing HCBS providers’ financial incentives, which can lead to over-utilization of HCBS. Examples among our case study states include: North Carolina: A program integrity review conducted by CMS in North Carolina found that the state’s transition to the use of an independent entity to conduct needs assessments for the State Plan Personal Care Services Program—rather than relying on HCBS providers to assess beneficiary needs—was followed by a reduction in both the number of beneficiaries using the program and a 30 percent reduction in average monthly expenditures. This suggests the program may have been over-utilized before the independent entity was used to conduct needs assessments. CMS highlighted this use of an independent entity as a practice that merits consideration from other states. Kentucky: State officials told us that when they transitioned to the use of independent assessors they also identified apparent instances of over-utilization that were occurring before they implemented independent assessments and other program changes. For example, officials said that when testing a new assessment tool using independent assessors, they identified individuals who had a low level of needs, and who did not appear to require an institutional level of care, as required for program eligibility, but who had been assessed at that level in the past. Conflict-of-interest concerns also exist for states with managed care HCBS programs where managed care plans conduct assessments. CMS has taken separate steps to address these concerns, including issuing guidance and new regulatory requirements. CMS issued guidance in May 2013 that addressed best practices and CMS’s expectations of new and existing managed long-term services and supports programs, which include managed care HCBS. The guidance stated that managed care plans may not be involved in any HCBS functional eligibility determinations or needs assessment processes prior to a beneficiary’s enrollment in the plan. CMS officials told us that allowing managed care plans to assess individuals before enrollment without proper oversight by the state may provide an opportunity for plans to selectively enroll individuals who require less HCBS. Despite this risk, we found that CMS does not always take steps to ensure that states have procedures in place to guard against this practice prior to approving their programs. CMS officials told us that they evaluate state programs individually and may not apply all of the detailed concepts in its guidance when developing state-specific requirements for managed care HCBS programs. CMS’s application of the guidance in the three states selected for this review varied across types of HCBS programs. Examples from 1115 Demonstration and HCBS Waiver programs for our case study states include the following: 1115 Demonstration programs: Of the six states we selected for this review, one—New York—operated a managed care HCBS program authorized by an 1115 demonstration. Prior to July 2015, New York used managed care plans to assess and determine individuals’ functional eligibility for certain HCBS programs. One managed care plan admitted to enrolling 1,740 individuals in managed care HCBS whose needs did not qualify them for the program from January 2011 to September 2013, and it resolved allegations that it had submitted false claims for Medicaid HCBS in a $35 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2013, CMS amended the terms and conditions of New York’s demonstration to require the state to use an independent assessor entity to both conduct needs assessments and determine eligibility for managed care HCBS, and New York has contracted with an independent assessor to carry out these functions. While this requirement applied specifically to New York, it does not necessarily apply to other states, as CMS’s terms and conditions for 1115 demonstrations can vary across states. According to CMS, an additional 11 states had managed care HCBS programs approved under 1115 demonstrations as of July 2017. However, CMS officials told us that they did not have information on whether or not these 11 states were using managed care plans to conduct needs assessments for the purpose of determining individuals’ functional eligibility. HCBS Waiver programs: Two of our six selected states—Minnesota and North Carolina—used managed care plans to deliver services for HCBS Waiver programs. In these states, CMS approved HCBS Waiver applications that proposed to use managed care plans to conduct or evaluate needs assessments used to determine functional eligibility for the programs, contrary to CMS’s May 2013 guidance. CMS officials said that when states allow managed care plans to be involved in these assessments, CMS would expect states to provide oversight as part of their quality improvement strategies required under HCBS Waivers. However, CMS does not require states to provide assurances or evidence of oversight directly related to managed care plans’ potential for conflicts of interest when plans are involved in needs assessments that states use to determine functional eligibility. CMS officials told us that states that do allow managed care plans to conduct assessments used to determine eligibility for HCBS should be aware of the potential for conflicts of interest in order to provide adequate oversight. CMS officials also told us that they engage in a conversation with states related to oversight of the assessment process when CMS learns of such states. However, CMS does not collect complete information on which states use managed care plans for needs assessments prior to enrollment, and states may not implement precautions absent a specific CMS requirement to address the potential for these conflicts of interest. The absence of requirements for states to address acknowledged risks is not consistent with federal internal control standards that require federal agencies to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. Developing Service Plans and Determining the Amount of HCBS to Provide Separate concerns pertain to managed care plans’ involvement in HCBS needs assessments for service planning purposes that are conducted by plans after enrollment. Advocates in two of the three selected states with managed care HCBS programs, New York and North Carolina, expressed concerns about managed care plans’ incentives to reduce their costs by reducing enrollees’ HCBS service levels, leading to reduced access to needed HCBS. For example, advocates in New York highlighted the growth in fair hearings that enrollees initiated to dispute reductions in HCBS they receive, which can result from inaccurate needs assessments. In May 2016, in the preamble to a final rule that amended managed care regulations, CMS responded to concerns from commenters about managed care plans’ involvement in the needs assessments used to develop service plans by stating that managed care plans’ HCBS needs assessments of enrollees are a critical component of the plans’ efforts to manage enrollees’ care. CMS also noted that existing appeals processes, which are similar to fair hearings, provide adequate safeguards to address instances when enrollees believe their needs assessments do not reflect their true needs. However, according to CMS, beneficiaries enrolled in managed long-term services and supports are among the most vulnerable and often require enhanced protections to assure their health and welfare. To implement additional beneficiary protections, the May 2016 managed care regulations require states with managed care HCBS programs to implement a beneficiary support system. A beneficiary support system generally provides individuals with education and assistance related to appeals, grievances, and fair hearings, and assists states with the identification and resolution of systemic issues through review and oversight of program data. These regulations also require states to report annually on the activities and performance of these systems in order to drive continual improvements. CMS stated that reporting requirements of this nature would help the agency address fragmented program information about state managed care programs and help improve oversight efforts. However, as of September 2017, CMS had not issued guidance to states on the content and form of this reporting, and under the regulations, states are not required to submit reports until CMS issues such guidance. CMS officials told us they were unsure whether they would issue this guidance, and thus it is unclear whether and when the reporting requirement will take effect. We previously made a recommendation to CMS that pertains to this issue. Specifically, in a report published in August 2017, we identified similar concerns with the lack of requirements for state managed long- term services and supports programs to report information that CMS needs to adequately oversee states’ programs for ensuring beneficiary access to services. We found that existing state reporting did not always include key elements necessary for CMS to monitor certain key aspects of beneficiaries’ access and quality of care, including data related to appeals and grievances. We recommended that CMS improve its oversight of managed long-term services and supports by taking steps to identify and obtain key information needed to oversee states’ efforts to monitor beneficiary access to quality services. HHS concurred with this recommendation and stated that the agency will take this recommendation into account as part of an ongoing review of the 2016 managed care regulations. This action could help to address the concerns discussed above regarding managed care plans’ potential for conflicts of interest in conducting needs assessments for service planning purposes. HCBS needs assessments can directly affect whether individuals are eligible to receive HCBS and the amount of services they receive. Given the growth in spending for Medicaid HCBS and the potential vulnerability of individuals seeking HCBS, it is critical that needs assessments are effective in ensuring that beneficiaries receive the help they need to live independently while at the same time reducing the risk of over-utilization of HCBS. CMS plays an important role in ensuring that states appropriately assess the needs of those seeking HCBS, including addressing the potential for entities that conduct needs assessments to have conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest can result in inaccurate assessments, potentially leading to provision of unnecessary services or restricting other beneficiaries’ access to needed services. CMS has required states to take actions to avoid or mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest for some HCBS programs, and states that have taken steps to protect against conflicts of interest in HCBS programs have reported improvements; however, we found gaps in federal requirements for such safeguards. These gaps in requirements are inconsistent with federal control standards that require federal agencies to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. CMS could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Medicaid HCBS programs by taking additional steps to consistently require all types of states’ programs to avoid or mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest in conducting needs assessments, as appropriate. The Administrator of CMS should ensure that all types of Medicaid HCBS programs have requirements for states to avoid or mitigate potential conflicts of interest on the part of entities that conduct needs assessments that are used to determine eligibility for HCBS and to develop HCBS plans of service. These requirements should address both service providers and managed care plans conducting such assessments. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment, and HHS provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendix I. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. HHS concurred with our recommendation to ensure that all types of Medicaid HCBS programs have requirements for states to avoid or mitigate potential conflicts of interest on the part of entities that conduct needs assessments. HHS stated that it has a regulatory structure in place to protect against potential conflicts of interest on the part of entities responsible for determining eligibility for HCBS and developing service plans. As described in our report, however, there are gaps in required conflict of interest standards applicable to entities that conduct needs assessments that inform HCBS eligibility determinations. Further, the conflict of interest requirements related to service plans do not apply to all programs, such as State Plan Personal Care Services programs. Developing additional requirements in response to such gaps would further improve efficiency and effectiveness.

State and federal Medicaid HCBS spending was about $87 billion in 2015. Effective needs assessments help states ensure appropriate access to, and manage utilization of, services and therefore costs. States' processes vary, and challenges include the potential for assessors to have conflicts of interest leading to over- or under-estimating of beneficiaries' needs for HCBS. GAO was asked to examine states' needs assessment processes for provision of long-term services and supports. This report addresses (1) how selected states assess needs for HCBS, and (2) steps CMS has taken to improve coordination and effectiveness of needs assessments, among other objectives. GAO studied six states that varied in terms of assessment tools in use, participation in federal initiatives, HCBS delivery systems, and geographic location; reviewed federal requirements and documents; and interviewed CMS officials and stakeholders. The six selected states that GAO reviewed used multiple approaches to assess individuals' needs for Medicaid home- and community-based services (HCBS). Each state may have multiple HCBS programs authorized under different sections of the Social Security Act. These programs serve beneficiaries who generally need assistance with daily activities, such as bathing or dressing. States establish needs assessment processes to collect data on functional needs, health status, and other areas that they use to determine individuals' eligibility for HCBS and to plan services, such as the amount of services needed. The selected states varied in the extent to which they used different assessments across HCBS programs and used multiple types of entities—such as state or government agencies, contractors, or providers—to conduct them. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken steps to improve needs assessments but concerns about conflict of interest remain in regard to HCBS providers and managed care plans. HCBS providers may have a financial interest in the outcome of needs assessments, which could lead to overstating needs and overprovision of services. CMS has addressed risks associated with HCBS provider conflicts, such as by requiring states to establish standards for conducting certain needs assessments, but these requirements do not cover all types of HCBS programs. For example, specific conflict of interest requirements are generally not in place for needs assessments that are used to inform HCBS eligibility determinations. In addition, requirements for states to establish standards to address HCBS providers' potential for conflict of interest in conducting needs assessments that are used for service planning do not apply across all programs. Similarly, managed care plans may have a financial interest in the outcome of HCBS assessments used for both determining eligibility and service amounts. Managed care plans could have an incentive to enroll beneficiaries with few needs, as plans typically receive a fixed payment per enrollee. For example, a plan in one state admitted in a settlement with the federal government to enrolling 1,740 individuals, from 2011 through 2013, whose needs did not qualify them. In 2013, CMS issued guidance that managed care plans may not be involved in assessments used to determine eligibility for HCBS, but CMS has not consistently required states to prevent this involvement. Among three states GAO reviewed with managed care HCBS programs, CMS required one to stop allowing plans to conduct such assessments but allowed plan involvement in two states. The absence of conflict-of-interest requirements across all types of HCBS programs and states is not consistent with federal internal control standards, which require agencies to respond to risks to program objectives. GAO recommends that CMS ensure that all Medicaid HCBS programs have requirements for states to address both service providers' and managed care plans' potential for conflicts of interest in conducting assessments. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendation."], "length": 7999, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9c560a0cfeaf22e7d161b627e8eb74dfad8d7f62e5c82187"}
{"input": "", "context": "Prior to the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, insurers generally did not exclude or separately charge for coverage of terrorism risk. The events of September 11, 2001, changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible terrorism losses. Estimates of insured losses from the 9/11 attacks are more than $45 billion in current dollars, the largest insured losses from a nonnatural disaster on record. These losses were concentrated in business interruption insurance (34% of the losses), property insurance (30%), and liability insurance (23%). Although primary insurance companies—those that actually sell and service the insurance policies bought by consumers—suffered losses from the terrorist attacks, the heaviest insured losses were absorbed by foreign and domestic reinsurers, the insurers of insurance companies. Because of the lack of public data on, or modeling of, the scope and nature of the terrorism risk, reinsurers felt unable to accurately price for such risks and largely withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance in the months following September 11, 2001. Once reinsurers stopped offering coverage for terrorism risk, primary insurers, suffering equally from a lack of public data and models, also withdrew, or tried to withdraw, from the market. In most states, state regulators must approve policy form changes. Most state regulators agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from commercial policies, just as these policies had long excluded war risks. Terrorism risk insurance was soon unavailable or extremely expensive, and many businesses were no longer able to purchase insurance that would protect them in future terrorist attacks. In some cases, such insurance is required to consummate various transactions, particularly in the real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utility sectors. Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, some were concerned that the lack of coverage posed a threat of serious harm—such as job loss—to these industries, in turn threatening the broader economy. In November 2002, Congress responded to the fears of economic damage due to the absence of commercially available coverage for terrorism with passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). TRIA created a three-year Terrorism Insurance Program to provide a government reinsurance backstop in the case of terrorist attacks. The TRIA program was amended and extended in 2005, 2007, and 2015. Following the 2015 amendments, the TRIA program is set to expire at the end of 2020. (A side-by-side of the original law and the three reauthorization acts is in Table 1 .) The executive branch has been skeptical about the TRIA program in the past. Bills to expand TRIA were resisted by then-President George W. Bush's Administration, and previous presidential budgets under then-President Obama called for changes in the program that would have had the effect of scaling back the TRIA coverage. The current Administration has not called for specific changes to TRIA, but has indicated that it is \"evaluating reforms…to further decrease taxpayer exposure.\" The insurance industry largely continues to support TRIA, as do commercial insurance consumers in the real estate and other industries that have formed a \"Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism\" (CIAT). However, not all insurance consumers have consistently supported the renewal of TRIA. For example, the Consumer Federation of America has questioned the need for the program in the past. Although the United States has suffered attacks deemed \"terrorism\" since the passage of TRIA, no acts of terrorism have been certified and no payments have occurred under TRIA. For example, although the April 2013 bombing in Boston was termed an \"act of terror,\" by the President, the insured losses in TRIA-eligible insurance from that bombing did not cross the $5 million statutory threshold to be certified under TRIA. (See precise criteria under the TRIA program below.) The original TRIA legislation's stated goals were to (1) create a temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured terrorism losses to allow the private market to stabilize; (2) protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks; and (3) preserve state regulation of insurance. Although Congress has amended specific aspects of the original act, the operation of the program generally usually follows the original statute. The changes to the program have largely reduced the government coverage for terrorism losses, except that the 2007 amendments expanded coverage to domestic terrorism losses, rather than limiting the program to foreign terrorism. To meet the first goal, the TRIA program creates a mechanism through which the federal government could share insured commercial property and casualty losses with the private insurance market. The role of federal loss sharing depends on the size of the insured loss. For a relatively small loss, there is no federal sharing. For a medium-sized loss, the federal role is to spread the loss over time and over the entire insurance industry. The federal government provides assistance up front but then recoups the payments it made through a broad levy on insurance policies afterwards. For a large loss, the federal government is to pay most of the losses, although recoupment is possible (but not mandatory) in these circumstances as well. The precise dollar values where losses cross these small, medium, and large thresholds are uncertain and will depend on how the losses are distributed among insurers. For example, for loss sharing to occur, an attack must meet a certain aggregate dollar value and each insurer must pay out a certain amount in claims—known as its deductible. For some large insurers, this individual deductible might be higher than the aggregate threshold set in statute, meaning that loss sharing might not actually occur until a higher level than the figure set in statute. The criteria under the TRIA program in 2019 are as follows: 1. An individual act of terrorism must be certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General; losses must exceed $5 million in the United States or to U.S. air carriers or sea vessels for an act of terrorism to be certified. 2. The federal government shares in an insurer's losses due to a certified act of terrorism only if \"the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from such certified act of terrorism\" exceed $180 million (increasing to $200 million in 2020). 3. The federal program covers only commercial property and casualty insurance, and it excludes by statute several specific lines of insurance. 4. Each insurer is responsible for paying a deductible before receiving federal coverage. An insurer's deductible is proportionate to its size, equaling 20% of an insurer's annual direct earned premiums for the commercial property and casualty lines of insurance specified in TRIA. 5. Once the $180 million aggregate loss threshold and 20% deductible are met, the federal government would cover 81% of each insurer's losses above its deductible until the amount of losses totals $100 billion. 6. After $100 billion in aggregate losses, there is no federal government coverage and no requirement that insurers provide coverage. 7. In the years following the federal sharing of insurer losses, but prior to September 30, 2024, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to establish surcharges on TRIA-eligible property and casualty insurance policies to recoup 140% of some or all of the outlays to insurers under the program. If losses are high, the Secretary has the authority to assess surcharges, but is not required to do so. (See \" Recoupment Provisions \" below for more detail.) The initial loss sharing under TRIA can be seen in Figure 1 , adapted from a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. The exact amount of the 20% deductible at which TRIA coverage would begin depends on how the losses are distributed among insurance companies. In the aggregate, 20% of the direct-earned premiums for all of the property and casualty lines specified in TRIA totaled approximately $42 billion in 2017, according to the latest data collected by the Treasury Department. TRIA coverage is likely, however, to begin well under this amount as the losses from an attack are unlikely to be equally distributed among insurance companies. The precise amount TRIA requires the Treasury to recoup after the initial loss sharing is determined by the interplay between a number of different factors in the law and insurance marketplace. The general result of the recoupment provisions is that, for attacks that result in under $37.5 billion in insured losses, the Treasury Secretary is required to recoup 140% of the government outlays through surcharges on property and casualty insurance policies. For events with insured losses over $37.5 billion, the Secretary has discretionary authority to recoup all the government outlays and may be required to partially recoup the government outlays depending on the size of the attacks and the amount of uncompensated losses paid by the insurance industry. (See the Appendix for more information on exact recoupment calculations.) If the requirement for recoupment is triggered, TRIA requires the government to recoup all payments prior to the end of FY2024. Because the last reauthorization of TRIA occurred in January 2015, such recoupment would be completed within a 10-year timeframe following the previous reauthorization. For an attack causing significant insured loses, however, this requirement could result in high surcharges being applied for a relatively short time. The recoupment surcharges are to be imposed as a percentage of premiums paid on all TRIA-eligible property and casualty insurance policies, but the Secretary has the authority to adjust the amount of the premiums taking into consideration differences between rural and urban areas and the terrorism exposures of different lines of insurance. The administration of the TRIA program was originally left generally to the Treasury Secretary. This was changed somewhat in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The act created a new Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to be located within the Department of the Treasury. Among the duties specified for the FIO in the legislation was to assist the Secretary in the administration of the Terrorism Insurance Program. TRIA addresses the second goal—to protect consumers—by requiring insurers that offer TRIA-covered lines of insurance to make terrorism insurance available prospectively to their commercial policyholders. This coverage may not differ materially from coverage for other types of losses. Each terrorism insurance offer must reveal both the premium charged for terrorism insurance and the possible federal share of compensation. Policyholders are not, however, required to purchase coverage under TRIA. If a policyholder declines to purchase terrorism coverage, the insurer may exclude terrorism losses. Federal law does not limit what insurers can charge for terrorism risk insurance, although state regulators typically have the authority under state law to modify excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates. TRIA's third goal—to preserve state regulation of insurance—is expressly accomplished in Section 106(a), which provides that \"Nothing in this title shall affect the jurisdiction or regulatory authority of the insurance commissioner [of a state].\" The Section 106(a) provision has two exceptions, one permanent and one temporary (and expired): (1) the federal statute preempts any state definition of an \"act of terrorism\" in favor of the federal definition and (2) the statute briefly preempted state rate and form approval laws for terrorism insurance from enactment to the end of 2003. In addition to these exceptions, Section 105 of the law also preempts state laws with respect to insurance policy exclusions for acts of terrorism. The TRIA statute does not specifically include or exclude property and casualty insurance coverage for terrorist attacks according to the particular methods used in the attacks, such as nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological (NBCR) and cyber terrorism risks. Such nonconventional means, however, have the potential to cause losses that may or may not end up being covered by TRIA and have been a source of particular concern and attention in the past. Some observers consider a terrorist attack with some form of NBCR weapon to be the most likely type of attack causing large scale losses. The current TRIA statute does not specifically include or exclude NBCR events; thus, the TRIA program in general would cover insured losses from terrorist actions due to NCBR as it would for an attack by conventional means. The term insured losses , however, is a meaningful distinction. Except for workers' compensation insurance, most insurance policies that would fall under the TRIA umbrella include exclusions that would likely limit insurer coverage of an NCBR event, whether it was due to terrorism or to some sort of accident, although these exclusions have never been legally tested in the United States after a terrorist event. If these exclusions are invoked and do indeed limit the insurer losses due to NBCR terrorism, they would also limit the TRIA coverage of such losses. Language that would have specifically extended TRIA coverage to NBCR events was offered in the past, but was not included in legislation as enacted. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was directed to study the issue and a GAO report was issued in 2008, finding that \"insurers generally remain unwilling to offer NBCR coverage because of uncertainties about the risk and the potential for catastrophic losses.\" In the past, legislation (e.g., H.R. 4871 in the 113 th Congress) would have provided for differential treatment of NBCR attacks under TRIA, but such legislation has not been enacted. Concern regarding potential damage from cyber terrorism has grown as increasing amounts of economic activity occur online. The TRIA statute does not specifically address the potential for cyber terrorism, thus, there was uncertainty about such attacks would be covered in the same manner as terrorist attacks using conventional means. In 2016, state insurance regulators introduced a new Cyber Liability line of insurance, raising questions as to whether coverage under this line would be covered under TRIA, or whether it would not be covered under the law's exclusion of \"professional liability\" insurance. The Department of the Treasury released guidance in December 2016 clarifying that \"stand-alone cyber insurance policies reported under the 'Cyber Liability' line are included in the definition of 'property and casualty insurance' under TRIA.\" Despite Treasury's guidance, cyber terrorism coverage remains a particular concern. The Treasury Department devoted a specific section of the latest report on TRIA to cyber coverage, reporting that 50% of standalone cyber insurance policies (based on premium value) included terrorism coverage. The take-up rate for those choosing cyber coverage that is embedded in policies covering additional perils was 54%. These rates are similar to, but slightly lower than, the 62% take-up rate for general terrorism coverage found across all TRIA-eligible lines. Stripped to its most basic elements, insurance is a fairly straightforward operation. An insurer agrees to assume an indefinite future risk in exchange for a definite current premium. The insurer pools a large number of risks such that, at any given point in time, the ongoing losses will not be larger than the current premiums being paid, plus the residual amount of past premiums that the insurer retains and invests, plus, in a last resort, any borrowing against future profits if this is possible. For the insurer to operate successfully and avoid failure, it is critical to accurately estimate the probability of a loss and the severity of that loss so that a sufficient premium can be charged. Insurers generally depend upon huge databases of past loss information in setting these rates. Everyday occurrences, such as automobile accidents or natural deaths, can be estimated with great accuracy. Extraordinary events, such as large hurricanes, are more difficult, but insurers have many years of weather data, coupled with sophisticated computer models, with which to make predictions. Many see terrorism risk as fundamentally different from other risks, and thus it is often perceived as uninsurable by the private insurance market without government support for the most catastrophic risk. The argument that catastrophic terrorism risk is uninsurable typically focuses on lack of public data about both the probability and severity of terrorist acts. The reason for the lack of historical data is generally seen as a good thing—few terrorist attacks are attempted and fewer have succeeded. Nevertheless, the insurer needs some type of measurable data to determine which terrorism risks it can take on without putting the company at risk of failure. As a replacement for large amounts of historical data, insurers turn to various forms of terrorism models similar to those used to assess future hurricane losses. Even the best model, however, can only partly replace good data, and terrorism models are still relatively new compared with hurricane models. One prominent insurance textbook identifies four ideal elements of an insurable risk: (1) a sufficiently large number of insureds to make losses reasonably predictable; (2) losses must be definite and measurable; (3) losses must be fortuitous or accidental; and (4) losses must not be catastrophic (i.e., it must be unlikely to produce losses to a large percentage of the risks at the same time). Terrorism risk in the United States would appear to fail the first criterion as terrorism losses have not proved predictable over time. Losses to terrorism, when they occur, are generally definite and measurable, so terrorism risk could pass under criteria two. Such risk, however, also likely fails the third criterion due to the malevolent human actors behind terrorist attacks, whose motives, means, and targets of attack are constantly in flux. Whether it fails the fourth criterion is largely decided by the underwriting actions of insurers themselves (i.e., whether the insurers insure a large number of risks in a single geographic area that would be affected by a terrorist strike). Unsurprisingly, insurers generally have sought to limit their exposures in particular geographic locations with a conceptually higher risk for terrorist attacks, making terrorism insurance more difficult to find in those areas. Although the U.S. experience with terrorism is relatively limited, other countries have dealt with the issue more extensively and have developed their own responses to the challenges presented by terrorism risk. Spain, which has seen significant terrorist activity by Basque separatist movements, insures against acts of terrorism via a broader government-owned reinsurer that has provided coverage for catastrophes since 1954. The United Kingdom, responding to the Irish Republican Army attacks in the 1980s, created Pool Re, a privately owned mutual insurance company with government backing, specifically to insure terrorism risk. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, many foreign countries reassessed their terrorism risks and created a variety of approaches to deal with the risks. The UK greatly expanded Pool Re, whereas Germany created a private insurer with government backing to offer terrorism insurance policies. Germany's plan, like the United States' TRIA, was created as a temporary measure. It has been extended since its inception, most recently until the end of 2019. Not all countries, however, concluded that some sort of government backing for terrorism insurance was necessary. Canada specifically considered, and rejected, creating a government program following September 11, 2001. Terrorism risk post-2001 is not the first time the United States has faced a risk perceived as uninsurable in private markets that Congress chooses to address through government action. During World War II, for example, Congress created a \"war damage\" insurance program and it expanded a program insuring against aviation war risk following September 11, 2002. Since 1968, the National Flood Insurance Program has covered most of the insured flooding losses in the United States. The closest previous analog to the situation with terrorism risk may be the federal riot reinsurance program created in the late 1960s. Following large scale riots in American cities in the late 1960s, insurers generally pulled back from insuring in those markets, either adding policy exclusions to limit their exposure to damage from riots or ceasing to sell property damage insurance altogether. In response, Congress created a riot reinsurance program as part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. The federal riot reinsurance program offered reinsurance contracts similar to commercial excess reinsurance. The government agreed to cover some percentage of an insurance company's losses above a certain deductible in exchange for a premium paid by that insurance company. Private reinsurers eventually returned to the market, and the federal riot reinsurance program was terminated in 1985. The September 2001 terrorist attacks, and the resulting billions of dollars in insured losses, caused significant upheaval in the insurance market. Even before the attacks, the insurance market was showing signs of a cyclical \"hardening\" of the market in which prices typically rise and availability is somewhat limited. The unexpectedly large losses caused by terrorist acts exacerbated this trend, especially with respect to the commercial lines of insurance most at risk for terrorism losses. Post-September 11, insurers and reinsurers started including substantial surcharges for terrorism risk, or, more commonly, they excluded coverage for terrorist attacks altogether. Reinsurers could make such rapid adjustments because reinsurance contracts and rates are generally unregulated. Primary insurance contracts and rates are more closely regulated by the individual states, and the exclusion of terrorism coverage for the individual insurance purchaser required regulatory approval at the state level in most cases. States acted fairly quickly, and, by early 2002, 45 states had approved insurance policy language prepared by the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO, an insurance consulting firm), excluding terrorism damage in standard commercial policies. The lack of readily available terrorism insurance caused fears of a larger economic impact, particularly on the real estate market. In most cases, lenders prefer or require that a borrower maintain insurance coverage on a property. Lack of terrorism insurance coverage could lead to defaults on existing loans and a downturn in future lending, causing economic ripple effects as buildings are not built and construction workers remain idle. The 14-month period after the September 2001 terrorist attacks and before the November 2002 passage of TRIA provides some insight into the effects of a lack of terrorism insurance. Some examples in September 2002 include the Real Estate Roundtable releasing a survey finding that \"$15.5 billion of real estate projects in 17 states were stalled or cancelled because of a continuing scarcity of terrorism insurance\" and Moody's Investors Service downgrading $4.5 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities. This picture, however, was not uniform. For example, in July 2002, The Wall Street Journal reported that \"despite concerns over landlords' ability to get terrorism insurance, trophy properties were in demand.\" CBO concluded in 2005 that \"[TRIA] appears to have had little measurable effect on office construction, employment in the construction industry, or the volume of commercial construction loans made by large commercial banks,\" but CBO also noted that a variety of economic factors at the time \"could be masking positive macroeconomic effects of TRIA.\" TRIA's \"make available\" provisions addressed the availability problem in the terrorism insurance market, as insurers were required by law to offer commercial terrorism coverage. However, significant uncertainty existed as to how businesses would react, because there was no general requirement to purchase terrorism coverage and the pricing of terrorism coverage was initially high. Analyzing the terrorism insurance market in the aftermath of TRIA is challenging as well since there was no consistent regulatory reporting by insurers until P.L. 114-1 required detailed reporting, which Treasury began in 2016. Before this time, data on terrorism insurance typically stemmed from insurance industry surveys or rating bureaus. In examining the terrorism insurance market since TRIA, it is also important to note that no terrorist attacks have occurred that reached TRIA thresholds, thus property and casualty insurance has not made any large scale payouts for terrorism damages. The initial consumer reaction to the terrorism coverage offers was relatively subdued. Marsh, Inc., a large insurance broker, reported that 27% of their clients bought terrorism insurance in 2003. This take-up rate, however, climbed relatively quickly to 49% in 2004 and 58% in 2005. Marsh reported that, since 2005, the overall take-up rate has remained near 60%, with Marsh reporting a rate of 62% in 2017. The Treasury reports based on industry data calls have found similar or higher take-up rates. For 2017, Treasury found that the take-up rate based on premium volumes was 62%, whereas based on policy counts, the rate was 78%. The price for terrorism insurance has appeared to decline over time, although the level of pricing reported may not always be comparable between sources. The 2013 report by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, based on survey data by insurance broker Aon, showed a high of above 7% for the median terrorism premium as a percentage of the total property premium in 2003, with a generally downward trend, and more recent values around 3%. The trend may be downward, but there has been variability, particularly across industries. For example, Marsh reported rates in 2009 as high as 24% of the property premium for financial institutions and as low as 2% in the food and beverage industry. In the 2013 Marsh report, this variability was lower as 2012 rates varied from 7% in the transportation industry and the hospitality and gaming industry to 1% in the energy and mining industry. In 2017, Marsh found rates varying from 10% in hospitality and gaming to 2% in energy and mining and construction industries. The 2018 Treasury report, based on lines of insurance, not on industry category, found premiums varying from 6.1% in excess workers' compensation to 1.4% in ocean marine in 2017. Treasury found that the total premium amount paid for terrorism coverage in 2017 was approximately $3.65 billion, or 1.75%, of the $209.15 billion in total premiums for TRIA-eligible lines of insurance. Since the passage of TRIA, Treasury estimates that a total of approximately $38 billion was earned for terrorism coverage by non-related insurers, with another $7.4 billion earned by captive insurers (which are insurers who are owned by the insureds). In general, the capacity of insurers to bear terrorism risk has increased over the life of the TRIA program. The combined policyholder surplus among all U.S. property and casualty insurers was $686.9 billion at the end of 2017 compared to $408.6 billion (inflation adjusted) at the start of 2002. This $686.9 billion has been bolstered by the estimated $38 billion in premiums paid for terrorism coverage over the years without significant claims payments. The policyholder surplus, however, backs all property and casualty insurance policies in the United States and is subject to depletion in a wide variety of events. For example, extreme weather losses could particularly draw capital away from the terrorism insurance market, because events such as hurricanes share some characteristics—low frequency and the possibility of catastrophic levels of loss—with terrorism risk. Table 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of selected provisions from the original TRIA law, along with the reauthorizing laws of 2005, 2007, and 2015. Table A-1 contains illustrative examples of how the recoupment for the government portion of terrorism losses under TRIA might be calculated in the aggregate for various sizes of losses. The total amount of the combined deductibles in the table is simply assumed to be 30% of the insured losses for illustrative purposes. (The actual deductible amount is, as detailed above, based on the total amount of premiums collected by each insurer.) Without knowing the actual distribution of losses due to a terrorist attack, it is impossible to know what the actual total combined deductible amount would be. Table conclusions with regard to recoupment, however, hold across different actual deductible amounts. The specific provisions of the law define the \"insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount\" (Column F) for 2019 as the lesser of $37.5 billion or the total amount of insured losses (Column A). The \"mandatory recoupment amount\" (Column G) is defined as the difference between $37.5 billion and the aggregate insurer losses that were not compensated for by the program (i.e., the total of the insurers' deductible (Column B) and their 19% loss share (Column C)). If the aggregate insured loss is less than $37.5 billion, the law requires recoupment of 140% of the government outlays (Column H). For insured losses over $37.5 billion, the mandatory recoupment amount decreases, thus the Secretary would be required to recoup less than 133% of the outlays. Depending on the precise deductible amounts, the uncompensated industry losses (Column D) may eventually rise to be greater than $37.5 billion, which would then mean that the mandatory recoupment provisions would not apply. The Secretary would still retain discretionary authority to apply recoupment surcharges no matter what level uncompensated losses reached.", "answers": ["Prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, coverage for losses from such attacks was normally included in general insurance policies without additional cost to the policyholders. Following the attacks, such coverage became expensive, if offered at all. Moreover, some observers feared that the absence of insurance against terrorism loss would have a wider economic impact, because insurance is required to consummate a variety of transactions (e.g., real estate). For example, if real estate deals were not completed due to lack of insurance, this could have ripple effects—such as job loss—on related industries like the construction industry. Terrorism insurance was largely unavailable for most of 2002, and some have argued that this adversely affected parts of the economy, while others suggest the evidence is inconclusive. Congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA; P.L. 107-297), which created a temporary three-year Terrorism Insurance Program. Under TRIA, the government would share the losses on commercial property and casualty insurance should a foreign terrorist attack occur, with potential recoupment of this loss sharing after the fact. In addition, TRIA requires insurers to make terrorism coverage available to commercial policyholders, but does not require policyholders to purchase the coverage. The program expiration date was extended in 2005 (P.L. 109-144), 2007 (P.L. 110-160), and 2015 (P.L. 114-1). Over the course of such reauthorizations, the prospective government share of losses has been reduced and the recoupment amount increased, although the 2007 reauthorization also expanded the program to cover losses from acts of domestic terrorism. The TRIA program is currently slated to expire at the end of 2020. In general terms, if a terrorist attack occurs under TRIA, the insurance industry covers the entire amount for relatively small losses. For a medium-sized loss, the government assists insurers initially but is then required to recoup the payments it made to insurers through a broad levy on insurance policies afterwards—the federal role is to spread the losses over time and over the entire insurance industry and insurance policyholders. As the size of losses grows larger, the federal government covers more of the losses without this mandatory recoupment. Ultimately, for the largest losses, the government is not required to recoup the payments it has made, although discretionary recoupment remains possible. The precise dollar values where losses cross these small, medium, and large thresholds are uncertain and will depend on how the losses are distributed among insurers. The specifics of the current program are as follows: (1) a terrorist act must cause $5 million in insured losses to be certified for TRIA coverage; (2) the aggregate insured losses from certified acts of terrorism must be $180 million in a year for the government coverage to begin (this amount increases to $200 million in 2020); and (3) an individual insurer must meet a deductible of 20% of its annual premiums for the government coverage to begin. Once these thresholds are met, the government covers 81% of insured losses due to terrorism (this amount decreases to 80% in 2020). If the insured losses are less than $37.5 billion, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to recoup 140% of government outlays through surcharges on TRIA-eligible property and casualty insurance policies. As insured losses rise above $37.5 billion, the Secretary is required to recoup a progressively reduced amount of the outlays. At some high insured loss level, which will depend on the exact distribution of losses, the Secretary would no longer be required to recoup outlays. Since TRIA's passage, the private industry's willingness and ability to cover terrorism risk have increased. According to data collected by the Treasury, in 2017, approximately 78% of insureds purchased the optional terrorism coverage, paying $3.65 billion in premiums. Over the life of the program, premiums earned by unrelated insurers have totaled $38 billion. This relative market calm has been under the umbrella of TRIA coverage and in a period in which no terrorist attacks have occurred that resulted in government payments under TRIA. It is unclear how the insurance market would react to the expiration of the federal program, although at least some instability might be expected were this to occur. With the upcoming 2020 expiration of the program, the 116th Congress may consider legislation to extend TRIA; to date, no such legislation has been introduced."], "length": 5415, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d3b3b72a2836731984ddaeedef02d1d523ca0b4fdea81a28"}
{"input": "", "context": "The Military Health System is responsible for, among other things, assuring the overall oral health of all uniformed DOD personnel. As part of this health system, each service’s dental corps provides dental care for its servicemembers. The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force Dental Corps include approximately 3,000 active duty dentists and approximately 247 (200 in the United States) dental clinics to serve over 1.3 million servicemembers. Unlike their medical counterparts, the services’ dental corps rarely provide beneficiary care, according to service officials. The primary role of military dentists is to ensure the oral health and readiness of servicemembers. Servicemembers’ oral health is evaluated using standardized measures to determine the extent to which they are deployable. Generally, servicemembers with identified urgent, emergent, or unknown dental treatment needs are not considered to be worldwide deployable until their oral health is adequately addressed. Most military dentists enter service through the Armed Forces’ Health Professions Scholarship Program (AFHPSP), a scholarship program available to students enrolled in or accepted to dental school. Under the services’ AFHPSP program, DOD pays for tuition, books, and fees, and provides a monthly stipend. In return, the students incur an obligation to serve 6 months of active duty service for each 6 months of benefits received, with a 2-year minimum obligation. AFHPSP dental students can pursue either a Doctor of Dental Surgery or Doctor of Dental Medicine degree to become a general dentist. In addition to the AFHPSP program, the services recruit fully qualified licensed dentists. For example, individuals may become military dentists through direct accessions, either by entering the service as a fully trained, licensed dentist or through the Financial Assistance Program, which provides stipends for dentists accepted or enrolled in a residency program. For additional information on these and other recruitment programs, see appendix I. Regardless of the recruitment program, dentists may begin to practice after obtaining a degree and completing licensure requirements. Military dentists may pursue postgraduate training through a general dentistry program, such as the Advanced Education in General Dentistry Program, a general practice residency, or a specialty dental program offered through the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Postgraduate Dental College. Postgraduate dental college includes training and/or residency within a specific specialty and typically requires between 1 to 6 years of additional training. While in a postgraduate dental college program, participants incur an additional 6 months of active duty service obligation for each 6 months in training, with a minimum of 2 years active duty service obligation. However, this obligation can be served concurrently with obligations already incurred through AFHPSP if incurred through sponsored postgraduate education in a military or affiliated program. Figure 1 portrays the path to becoming a military dentist and the active duty obligation incurred for AFHPSP dental students. Each service takes steps to validate whether the military dentist has the appropriate professional qualifications and clinical abilities. Validation includes ensuring the dentist is credentialed and privileged to practice. See appendix II for more details on service processes for monitoring qualification and performance of dentists. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) serves as the principal advisor for all DOD health policies and programs. The ASD(HA) issues DOD instructions, publications, and memorandums that implement policy approved by the Secretary of Defense or the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and governs the management of DOD medical programs. The ASD(HA) also exercises authority, direction, and control over the President of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). Further, ASD(HA) sets the special and incentive pay amounts for all military dentists. The ASD(HA) reports to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, who in turn reports to the Secretary of Defense. The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force medical commands and agencies report through their service chiefs to their respective military department secretaries and then to the Secretary of Defense. The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have the authority to recruit, train, and retain dentists. Each military service has its own organizational structure and responsibilities. See figure 2. In September 2013, the Defense Health Agency was established to support greater integration of clinical and business processes across the Military Health System. The Defense Health Agency, among other things, manages the execution of policies issued by the ASD(HA) and manages and executes the Defense Health Program appropriation, which funds the services medical departments. By no later than September 30, 2021, the Director of the Defense Health Agency will assume responsibility for the administration of each military treatment facility, to include budgetary matters, information technology, and health care administration and management, among other things. Although military treatment facilities include dental clinics, DOD initially intended to exclude dental care (except oral and maxillofacial surgery), from the transfer to the Defense Health Agency. However, as of September 2018, DOD stated it is assessing the extent to which dental care will fall under the Defense Health Agency’s administration. In July 2010, we found that the services’ collaborative planning efforts to determine staffing of medical personnel working in fixed military treatment facilities, including dentists, were limited, and that their staffing models and tools had not been validated and verified in all cases as DOD policy requires. Specifically, we found that some Army specialty modules contained outdated assumptions, and that only a portion of the models had been completely validated. We also found that the Navy did not have a model, but instead employed a staffing tool that used current manning as a baseline and adjusted its requirements based on emerging needs or major changes to its mission. However, the Navy’s tool was not validated or verified in accordance with DOD policy. Further, we found that the Air Force may not know its true medical requirements because the model it relied on also was not validated or verified. We made several recommendations in our 2010 report, two of which were aimed at improving staffing of MTFs. Specifically, we recommended that the services identify common medical capabilities shared across military treatment facilities and develop and implement cross-service medical staffing standards for these capabilities as appropriate. We also recommended that each service update or develop medical personnel requirements determination tools as needed to ensure that they use validated and verifiable processes. The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have implemented our recommendation related to the development and implementation of validated and verifiable tools for developing medical personnel requirements. Additionally, they identified and developed standardized cross-service staffing standards for over 40 medical specialties and incorporated them into their individual MTF staffing tools. The Army and the Air Force have validated the dental clinic staffing models that they use, and the Navy’s draft model is under review. In the absence of a validated model, the Navy uses a general ratio to staff its dental clinics. See table 1 for a description of each of the services’ methodology for staffing dental clinics. The Army and the Air Force models, which were developed in accordance with DOD guidance and service-specific requirements, are subject to the following validation processes: Army. Since 2011, the Army has used the Army Dental Clinic Model, which, according to officials, is intended to determine the minimum number of dentists necessary, by location, to ensure the medical readiness of soldiers. Army staffing models are subject to validation by the U.S. Army Manpower Analysis Agency, which validated the Army’s Dental Clinic Model when it was developed in 2011. According to an Army official, the model’s validation expired in 2014, and was not re-validated until May 2018 due to limited resources. Additionally, Army officials stated that the data used in the model are updated on an annual basis and that the model is subject to revalidation every 5 years. Air Force. Since 2014, according to Air Force officials, the Air Force has used its Dental Manpower Model to determine the minimum number of dentists required, by clinic, to ensure the medical readiness of servicemembers served by Air Force dental clinics. According to Air Force officials, the Air Force Dental Manpower Model is subject to review and validation that includes input from the Air Force Medical Service; Surgeon General’s Manpower, Personnel, and Resources office; Air Force Personnel Center; and consultants. Officials told us the model is reviewed and validated annually and presented to the Dental Operations Panel and Air Force’s medical service corporate structure. The model was most recently validated in April 2018. According to Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) officials, the Navy does not yet have a model and therefore instead uses a general ratio of one dentist for every 1,000 sailors as a baseline to initially determine the staffing requirements of its dental clinics. This ratio is adjusted based upon emerging needs or major changes to mission. In 2013, according to Navy officials, BUMED began developing a Dental Services Model that could be used to determine dental clinic staffing needs. In November 2016, BUMED internally released a draft report recommending that the dental corps approve and implement the Dental Services Model as the staffing standard for dental clinics. According to a Navy official, this report was provided to dental corps leadership for review in July 2018 and they are expected to complete their review in October 2018. According to BUMED officials, if the dental corps leadership approves the model for use as an official staffing standard, the model would be subject to official Navy validation processes which, in accordance with DOD policy, would entail verification and validation throughout the model’s lifecycle. Conversely, if the dental corps decides to use the model as an informal staffing tool to supplement its current processes, a BUMED official stated that it will be subject to an ad-hoc internal review every 3 years that mirrors the Navy’s review of its validation process. Currently, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force each use different service-specific standards and other factors to determine the number of dentists needed at their respective dental clinics. As previously discussed, the services have developed and are in the process of implementing cross-service staffing standards—that is, a standardized approach to staffing the common day-to-day health needs of the patient population—for certain medical specialties. In response to DOD policy and our 2010 recommendation, the services established a working group to identify and develop common cross-service staffing standards, and in 2017, the tri-service working group established such standards for 42 different medical specialties. These standards are based on actual workload data for common capabilities within selected medical specialties and were incorporated into each service’s staffing tools to provide consistent values for the minimum number of staff required to meet patient needs. However, according to an official involved in the development of the standards, the services have not collaborated to develop a plan to establish a similar set of standards for dental care. DOD guidance directs modeling and simulation management to develop plans and procedures and to pursue common and cross-cutting modeling tools and data across the services. Also, the ASD(HA) has supported the effort to establish consistent workload drivers across services for determining personnel requirements for MTFs. According to a tri-service working group co-chair, they did not develop cross-service staffing standards for dental care because at the time, the quality of available data on dental procedure frequency and duration varied across the services. The same official stated that these data have been improved, but they still do not have plans to develop cross-service staffing standards for dental care. Additionally, service officials maintained that they must operate their respective dental clinics autonomously and in a manner that best supports their service-specific needs and unique command structures. Specifically, officials from each service’s dental corps stated that their primary mission is focused on the medical readiness of servicemembers and generally does not involve beneficiary care. As such, they have not collaborated on staffing efforts with the other services. While we recognize that each service operates under a
